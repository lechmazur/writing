<comment>The apprentice’s “steady curiosity” drives tactile micro-choices—touching cards, holding tape—that anchor point-of-view and motivate every beat; interiority stays sensory (“rainlight,” “hiss of tape”) rather than diagnostic. No contradiction is dramatized inside a single high-pressure beat, so the hoped-for escalation of internal conflict is only implied; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is more communal than personal, capping intensity just under 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the tape becomes “a ribbon festival” that reweights inherited mystery into communal song; cost is felt in the unspoken admission that people remain scattered yet still choired. Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of “multiply paths” taught early, returns in every client vignette, and tightens through final image without causal contradiction. Orientation locked inside 120 words; no props teleport; only minor scaffold is the repeated “she taught me” refrain.</comment>

<comment>Rain-beaded skylight, onyx cards, and the live measuring tape function as micro-setting that literally guides feet across the city; tape’s hiss is auditory track that keeps spatial choreography legible. Loft → alley → peeled-paint wall all track cleanly; weather stays causal (rain = both obstacle and grandmother). Final image of tape-as-ribbon is charged by prior tactile handling, satisfying 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping survivable paths after economic collapse—tightens once when ribbon is tied to kid’s wrist and again when tape is stretched into dusk to reveal hidden mural; each multiplication forecloses fantasy of whole mural yet reopens walkable routes. Escalation is accumulative: each client adds fragment, density rises, but no single beat forces irreversible trade-off for narrator; cost is communal, felt but not individually priced, keeping score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “value = what people can still walk”: every object (buttons, cracked screens, recipes) is repriced by its routeability, culminating in ribbon-festival image that reweights inherited mystery without moralizing. No character states thesis; silence after mural laugh carries irony that survival beats wholeness. Final image invites multiple readings—mourning, celebration, or both—while remaining anchored in concrete tape-line, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person apprentice voice owns a tactile, rain-flecked diction (“rain stitched the glass,” “tape taught humility”) that remains consistent under pressure. No dialogue to test voice convergence, but internal rhythm modulates: longer clause chains during wonder, staccato when pinning cards. Perceptual signature is curiosity-through-touch; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; compressed lyric syntax is taught early and paid off in final ribbon image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse weather, tool, and philosophy (“We were reverse engineering the city from the wreckage of its bets”). Figurative layering serves accumulative pattern without muddling causality; only minor scaffold is iterative “she taught me” which functions as chorus. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; final tape-hiss sentence propels closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-crypto-collapse cartomancy that uses measuring tape instead of prophecy, converting urban fragments into walkable poetics. Risky accumulative mosaic (four shards) taught by 25% and paid off in communal ribbon-festival. Inevitable in hindsight—every crack, button, and pigment patch returns reweighted—yet nowhere predictable. Specificity of “elbows, not eyes” selection ritual and “rain as grandmother” roots magic in lived refugee memory, transforming trope of magical mentor into city-scale mutual-aid map.</comment>
