<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“I had once shouted for a cause until my throat bled”) and her pedagogy of subtraction is dramatized through the rosette pass and final silence. Yet the students remain types—Rafi’s “smoke,” Ola’s “tremble,” Jin’s “lighthouse” are poetic labels rather than contradictory impulses acted out in scene. The closing gesture of handing the warm rosette through the rows shows micro-choice, but no student flaw or internal shift compounds a visible cost to any one of them. At this length the ensemble functions as a single choral body, so the arc lands on Mara’s earned stillness, not individual reckonings.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each rehearsal layer adds density until the final charged poise of shared silence reweights the stake from “vanishing arts” to “listening survives us.” Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the rosette’s touch-line tracks cleanly from cabinet to closing circulation, providing a visible constraint. Orientation is immediate (velvet library, autumn dusk) and the single transition from rehearsal to performance is legible. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the art is no longer vanished because the room now “keeps their breath”—a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The velvet library is not backdrop; its curtains “like patient throats” and shelves “breathing through spines” literally absorb the choir’s sound, turning setting into resonating chamber that later “exhaled dust and memory.” Autumn is handled as “a hush made visible,” a sensory filter that narrows perception to listening. The rosette serves as micro-setting: handled, dropped, caught, and finally warmed by every palm, its changing state tracks the evening’s arc. Spatial choreography stays coherent—cabinet, table, music stand, doorway—without white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“braid diverse voices into harmony”—is signaled early and tightens through subtractive rehearsals where silence replaces hate. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each erased judgment margin and shared breath thickens texture rather than flipping a causal turn. The rosette drop-catch between Rafi and Ola is the single micro-reversal that crystallizes trust; no further obstacle appears. Cost is conceptual but legible: the choir must keep practicing subtraction or the bridge collapses—an ongoing endurance rather than a decisive win.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recurring subtraction metaphor and the rosette’s migration: preservation is not hoarding but passing on. No character states the moral; the final image of warmed wood circulating in the dark lets the reader feel that listening is the surviving art. Ambiguity remains—hatred is only “unlearned” measure by measure, not erased—creating plausible counter-readings. The ending avoids sermon while still reweighting the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: Mara notices “soft arithmetic,” “smoke in tone,” “first leaf that loosens.” Syntax stretches into poetic parallelism but stays controlled; no filter-verb clutter. Compression (“Autumn folded itself…”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. Dialogue is minimal, yet when Rafi “offered it to Ola like a coin of safe passage,” the indirect line carries subtext and status shift without ventriloquizing the teenagers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the staccato of “Rafi caught it, then offered…” mirroring musical phrasing. Figurative density is high but patterned—rosette as sun, compass, coin, bird—each reprise reweights meaning without mixed-metaphor collision. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or beat. A single over-ripe phrase (“injuries too old for their years”) barely grazes the closure beat and does not obscure it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “choir dissolves enmity via subtraction” premise risks sentimentality, yet the vanished-border grandmother backstory and the rosette’s material history particularize the trope. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist, and the payoff—silence as publishable sound—feels fresh. Detail is specific to this room, this valley, these palms; removing any line collapses the acoustic metaphor. The piece could sit beside Ali Smith or Jackie Kay without apology.</comment>
