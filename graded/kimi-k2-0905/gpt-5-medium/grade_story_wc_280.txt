<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and synesthetic, giving a singular perceptual signature; the cashier-narrator’s ritualistic return and tender caretaking feel internally coherent. Yet no meaningful change or renunciation is dramatized—we end where we began, only mood-shifted—so the arc is static. The ghost’s motivations are eloquently voiced but not tested by a visible choice that costs him. Still, the prose constantly embodies emotion (smells, colors, bones) and avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative-textural lens: each lyrical shard layers sensory density until the final image reweights the stake—nostalgia becomes a gentle release. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and hold; transitions across maze ↔ theater are legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: the coin cools, the bell fades, the orchard bows—felt cost is the ongoing shared custodianship that neither can quit. The piece meets the 9+ quick test under the lyric mode.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting rules: the coin, orchard, and maze are not backdrop but navigational tools that re-route the couple’s path. Sensory hierarchy mirrors synesthetic bias—sound-colors, smelled textures—so every descriptor alters movement. Spatial choreography stays clean as the hedge rearranges itself; no floating rooms. The final image of leaf-door onto swept seats is inseparable from the emotional coda, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: mutual caretaking of a fractured timeline. Pressure deepens by accretion—each echo, fracture, and spectral chorus thickens nostalgia’s weight rather than narrows options. No reversal, but one meaningful cadence shift when the orchard reconfigures passages, forcing literal and emotional step-through. Cost is diffuse but legible: perpetual return with no true release.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the necessity of rehearsed letting-go; no moral is stated. Subtext in the ghost’s empty handshake and cooled coin implies that possibility is sustained only by unclosed absence. Final image of sweeping empty seats re-primes the loop, reframing prior motifs (echoes, apples, star) into quiet endurance. Complexity remains—no side is judged for clinging.</comment>

<comment>First-person voice is synesthetic, tactile, and rhythmically controlled—short percussive clauses mimic footsteps, longer lyrical spans swell like curtains. Diction (“paint shivers like spilled music,” “green cymbals”) stays inside a cashier-poet’s plausible lexis. No dialogue, so voice distinction judged solely within narration, which never drifts register. Patterned repetition of “echoes,” “orchard,” “timeline” is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or motion. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “we always” lines could compress. Metaphors stay coherent within synesthetic logic, no mixed vehicles. No loops or filter-verb stacks; nouns and verbs carry weight. Closure line “my heart the sound of home” risks triteness but earns poise via accumulated sensory debt.</comment>

<comment>Ghost-as-caregaker and synesthetic after-hours custodian feel fresh; familiar trope of haunted theater is rotated into collaborative orchard rehearsal. Specific detail—star coin citrus-brass flare, pears applauding from lantern hinges—transforms stock images. Risky lyric structure holds without losing clarity. Not quite 9 because core situation (return-nightly, release-rehearse) could still transplant to another venue with minimal rewrite.</comment>
