<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivo’s “walk-reader” gift is vivid and embodied; his micro-choice to scrape knuckle for metallic weather shows bodily attention. The zodiac coin works as a pause-button, not a magic talisman—its reappearance at the jammed gate ties internal rhythm to external fix. Interior contradiction is light: he never doubts his method, so the arc is competence, not growth; this caps emotional cost at “quiet nod.” Still, the renunciation of shouting earns its place because the port’s social credit visibly shifts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: storm → compass failure → Ivo’s whisper method → courier release. Closure is Charged Poise: the courtyard silence is a full cup that reconfigures power. Cost is felt when Rade’s violet face surrenders to stillness—authority is quietly repriced. The maps-as-lung image teaches the pattern early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>Container labyrinth is tactile—weld seams as veins, citrus-sweet air leaking from crates—details selected by Ivo’s professional filter. Micro-setting (zodiac coin pressed to hinge) becomes the tool that persuades steel, charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: crane frozen mid-swing stays frozen, gate hinge vibration is legible. Environment, tool, and body together constrain the last move—9+ gate met.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“whispers vs. shouts”—is signaled in paragraph 15 and tightened once when Rade’s men’s footfalls bounce back confused. Escalation is accumulative: each brass tap increases density until the gate acquiesces. Cost is conceptual: authority’s loudness is devalued; the port crews’ rhythm cleans itself in the hush. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the method, not declaration: quiet attention outperforms brute noise. Final image of silence as “a full cup” reweights prior shouting without moralizing. Motif of listening recurs (coin, brass key, courier’s knee-scrape) but never token; each instance constrains next move. Subtext in Rade’s surrendered grin carries more meaning than any shouted order.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Ivo tastes weather on bolts, hears boot conversations as distinct signatures. Syntax mimics his cadence—“a plan dressed as a whim”—compressed yet readable. No head-hopping; Rade’s interior is only guessed from outside. Brass key’s thin note and zodiac coin’s vibration are sensed through Ivo’s body, not explained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—“steel canyons swallowed his voice”—and never stacked. Information density high: one sentence folds maps, crane positions, and memory. Minor scaffold: “corrugations” repeated twice within 3 lines (−0.2); does not touch closure.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + walk-reader + origami maps yields a non-obvious heist-of-quiet. Risk-taking—no antagonist, no violence—pays off because authority is dismantled by acoustics. Transformation test fails if Ivo is renamed; whisper method is inseparable from his embodied perception. Port logistics feel lived, not Googled.</comment>
