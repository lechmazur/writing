<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interiority is vividly embodied through synesthetic recall (feather-barbed syllables, stone-warm recognition); the micro-choice to speak the “first true hello” crystallizes a credible renunciation of shame. Motive remains consistent: regain voice → pay with pain → seed new tongue. The seer acts as secondary pressure, forcing trade-offs; yet her own stakes stay off-page, capping at 8.6.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard jars re-assemble, the mountain exhales, and “home” is re-defined as daily vocal practice—cost is the lifelong labor of voicing shame. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seeding/feather/stonetext builds density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation taught by line 3 (“bookstore climbed the mountain”) and paid off when shelves realign into question-mark corridor. No causality breaks; substitution cycle is motivated by seer’s rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountain-as-bookshelf constrains every move: slope dictates pace, aisle-width forces intimacy, lantern-oil limits exploration. Micro-setting objects—feather, stone, mirror—function as mobile terrain that alters choices. Sensory economy favors tactile (flint-smell, barb-sting) over vista, matching memory’s haptic nature. Final image of open-air door sized for voice is environment literally shaped by organ, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the mouth be reclaimed?”—tightens via stone’s warmth-feather sting-mirror corridor sequence; each step forecloses silence. Agency is accretive: endure enumeration, touch stone, read mirror, choose corridor, speak. Cost is visceral (barb sting, riverbed grit) and conceptual (lifelong self-policing exposed). One meaningful intensification suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: voice buried by shame, home = daily practice of pronouncing the once-forbidden. Subtext rumbles in “hidden thunder” and mountain-exhalation rather than thesis lines. Final image of courtyard jars made whole offers non-literal answer—restoration is iterative, not architectural. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in nightly substitutions yet to come.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice maintains stable psychic distance; diction (“quicksilver,” “vellum,” “bellows”) stays within poet-traveler lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for ascent, staccato for barb enumeration, open vowels for finale. No dialogue contamination; seer’s speech is gnomic, boy’s warning terse, both distinct. Patterned metaphor (ivy-pages, storm-breath) taught early and paid off at closure without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence lengths create breath-mimicking cadence; no template runs. Metaphors interlock (ivy-pages, mercury-eyes, storm-breath) without mixed logic. High information density: one sentence often carries sensory, symbolic, and causal payload. Minor scaffold: “seed the mountain with a map” could compress, but does not dull closure beat, keeping below 9.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory palace + vertical bookstore + mercury divination; buried talent as geologic layer. Risk of baroque overload is embraced yet controlled by tactile grounding. Transformation test fails if substituted with generic library; mountain-breath and nightly substitution are irreplaceable. Specific inflection—question-mark corridor as vocal tract—makes premise feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
