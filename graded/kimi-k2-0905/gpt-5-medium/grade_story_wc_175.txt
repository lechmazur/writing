<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s “esoteric realist” label is asserted, not dramatized; no interior contradiction or micro-choice exposes what this stance costs him under pressure. The final promise to “stitch their names from moss and echo” is the first costly act we actually see; prior gestures feel observational. Still, the embodied attention to wing, wind, and knee-press carries credible specificity and a quiet hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fragile constructions builds toward Charged Poise—lying in green light waiting for “history to answer” reconfigures the stake from private ritual to communal witness. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure cost is oblique but legible: the act of relinquishing control to wind and stillness forecloses any guarantee the names will survive. One hairline slip: the hawk shadow “halt” is announced, not experienced, slightly blunting the cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grotto, wing, resin bead, and moss function as micro-settings that constrain gesture and timing; the monarch’s final circle is legible only because the altitude, wind shear, and stone acoustics were seeded early. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and hearing—exactly what an esoteric realist would trust. The environment actively withholds guarantee, charging the closing image. Meets 9+ gate: the resin-beaded wing directly shapes the final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring erased keepers—tightens once: from building disposable signals to risking the wing in resin, a shift that makes retrieval impossible. Pressure is situational and accumulative; no external antagonist, but wind, hawk shadow, and sunset compose a coherent threat. The tightening is single yet meaningful, satisfying short-form bar. Cost is present but sub-audible; a hairline shy of 8.0+ bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “interrupted cadence as survival” emerges through pattern, not statement: fern long/short, wing semaphore, halted monarch beat. Final image—green light, open eyes, unanswered history—reweights earlier optimism into earned vigilance. No moralizing; ambiguity is charged and coherent. One minor echo: “transiently rooted” is repeated without new inflection near end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric first-person maintains perceptual signature: precise yet slightly archaic diction (“blushing stillness,” “burned syllable of orange”) consistent with self-styled esoteric observer. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to clipped fragments under hawk shadow, then exhales. No head-hop; compression and elision are taught early and paid off. Voice could edge higher with one more micro-surprise in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and musical; figurative layering rarely repeats vehicles. One scaffold loop: “rehearsed loss while rehearsing respiration” is elegant but momentarily stalls momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s syntactic hush perfectly mirrors content. Within 9 contention but for that single self-paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lepidopterist activism as ephemeral land-art, monarch as final punctuation of a language no one speaks. Risk—quiet, almost static scene—heightens stakes by refusing spectacle. Concept feels inevitable once wing meets resin; transformation test passed. Not quite 9+ only because the esoteric-realist frame remains more label than lived distinction.</comment>
