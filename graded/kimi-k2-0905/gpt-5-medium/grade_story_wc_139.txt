<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory desire to “cancel debts cleanly” while abetting fraud is dramatized in every tactile choice; the tremor in Arman’s fingers against the gel-cold wrist embodies the cost. Micro-choices—draining the sink to mask cart scrape, singing under CCTV—reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The final image of the ink pot as “a little moon with tides that answer to hands” crystallizes the inherited moral calculus and forecloses the father’s path. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even the metaphor of “fairness is a curve” is earned through prior sensory stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal linkage is flawless: each beat (sink drain, alarm reset, dolly roll) is a because/therefore node that narrows escape options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—ink-stained ledger now indicts the corrupt—visible cost in the narrator’s stained thumbprint on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3; no disorientation remains. Lens holds: every object (ink pot, citrus reek, camera blink) is repurposed as tactical gear under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prep-room’s citrus-ethanol death breath is not backdrop but tool: the gel that cools Arman’s skin doubles as scent-mask for the director. Spatial choreography is surgical—cart wheels clear the sink drain radius, camera blink interval timed to breath margin. The ink pot’s scarred glass becomes a lunar timeline that constrains the final signature. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the last image where the narrator’s stained fingerprint becomes evidence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“fair trade that cancels debts”—tightens when the narrator realizes the ledger itself becomes the bribe evidence, swapping moral purity for legal ammunition. Escalation is one continuous ratchet: each institutional sound (vent sigh, alarm chime) shrinks temporal safe space. Visible price: the warm table spot is scrubbed clean, erasing Arman’s living heat—felt loss that forecloses retreat to old identity. No coincidence; every narrowing is authored by micro-decisions under camera gaze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: fairness as a curve the narrator must physically trace with ink-stained finger. Subtext lives in gesture—Arman’s squeeze of the wrist is both gratitude and transfer of risk. Final reconfiguration: the father’s forged tenderness is retroactively repurposed into legal testimony against the system he conned. No moralizing; the closing vowel of fairness is sonic, not didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is a mortician’s lyric: compressed, metallic, scented with ethanol. Syntax shortens under camera pressure—“I drain the sink to mask the scrape”—then elongates in reflection, mirroring vigil rhythm. Diction stays within a prep-room worker’s ken yet lifts into “timeline of a small moon” without register drift. Perceptual signature is tactile-olfactory; visual detail is rationed as if under surveillance.</comment>

<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—“breathing in the thin pencil-lines between my movements”—and never mixed. High-density doubling: the ink pot is simultaneously heirloom, forgery tool, and legal stamp. Rhythm breathes with escape tempo; no scaffolding even in transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: political asylum thriller set inside a cadaver prep room, resolved by calligraphy ink. Risk—using death rituals to smuggle life—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if relocated: the citrus-ethanol scent, the drain-mask acoustics, the ink pot’s lunar rings are irreplicable. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
