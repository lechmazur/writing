<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The widow’s interior contradiction—needing to remember yet refusing to restore the erased name—grounds every micro-choice; the embodied ritual of carving the absent collar while leaving the knot as scar shows a hierarchy of values with cost. Motivation stays legible under the kettle’s ticking clock and the carving’s resistance. The only slip is a hair of over-articulation (“harvest lessons from loss”) that edges short of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces naming the carving, the cloth bundle on the rain-cooled sill crystallizing that the hinge is refusal itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shaving, bead, and breath tightens the same stake—until the final image reweights “here and gone” as lived patience. Cost is visible in the unscarred tag notch and the sleeping-kettle cat. No orientation or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The loft’s ropes, skylight beads, and ash blank constrain every move: rain lenses freeze time, the bench dictates posture, the kettle metes grief. Micro-setting carries the final charge—the bundle cools beside kettle and tin, a new ring of three. One hairline slip: “city in beads” is briefly generic before rescued by later crystallization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—how to let absence stay present—tightens through pattern, not plot reversals: each shaving curls like whiskers, each droplet teaches impermanence. Agency is renunciation; the notch remains blank, foreclosing restoration. Cost is felt, but the escalation is accretive; a sharper inflection at the knot could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the scarred knot and untagged collar argue that love persists as negative space. The final “hinge” prayer answers with silence, a conceptual repricing that makes refusal the greater fidelity. No moralizing, only image—and the image hurts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The widow’s perceptual signature—wood as “patient animal,” kettle as “metronome for grief”—is sustained, rhythmically compressed under the boiling clock. No head-hopping; lyric elision (“steam ropes the air”) is taught early and paid off in the rain exhale. Syntax mirrors carving motion: long sentences shave into short, breath-like fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence is deliberate, but metaphor density nears the ceiling; “rain freckles…silver music” and “little lenses” within four lines flirt with overwriting. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed vehicles; compression stays information-rich. The final third is clean, allowing the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Circus-widow carpentry is fresh, yet the “wood is patient animal” trope has prior echoes; the synthesis with rain-as-time-crystal rescues it. Renouncing restoration of the erased name is a non-obvious, risky closure; specificity of collar-not-tag carries lived truth. Slight deduction for familiar whisker-curl image.</comment>
