<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Nessa’s interiority—"I think in loops and ledgers"—is dramatized through page-level micro-choices (painting the chip into wet paint, realigning rafts) that visibly cost her fraternal bond and political innocence. The contradictory pull between guild loyalty and consortium pay-cheque is kept alive in-scene, not summarised, culminating in the handshake chip moment that forecloses pure partisanship. Brother’s presence supplies status tension, but his interior is ventriloquised rather than inhabited, and the liaison’s poet-planner turn feels expedient rather than tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: carnival pathways fuse VIP and fish-market, the stone-chip imprint in paint makes the social cost legible, and we exit with options narrowed but not annihilated. The text teaches its mosaic rhythm early ("tents breathed", "sea syllables") so the lyrical elisions never break orientation. One causal seam wobbles: the console realignment beat is summarised rather than shown, muting the "because" that links chip-console-new geography.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Environment supplies the decisive tool—raft ballast console—activated through the chip’s grit, so the setting literally bends the plot. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered by Nessa’s planner gaze: she notes pigment codes, crowd flow, lantern wiring routes, never drifts into tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is impeccable from drum-barge to scaffold to hold; bodies and distances stay trackable. Weathered salt, solder burns, and paint viscosity body the city as working machinery rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent privatised fencing—tightens when Nessa barters a season’s delay; the visible price is her chip’s symbolic patrimony pressed into corporate paint. Escalation is textural/accumulative: fences "look lost" as colour-coded crowd eddies reroute revenue, a pattern break the liaison must tablet. One credible loss: the brother’s divided loyalty is openly strained, supplying personal cost to political manoeuvre. No meaningful counter-pressure after the liaison concedes; stakes plateau rather than double-back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete collision of carnival breath and ledger logic rather than authorial commentary: gentrification as "new accounting of hunger." Spiral-fossil motif accrues meaning without symbol-shout; it starts as childhood dare relic, ends as contractual seal, reweighting value from memory to negotiable currency. Final line’s "harmony you can steer by" offers resonant non-literal answer—hope is not victory but navigation instrument. Avoids tidy moral by leaving season-long outcome genuinely uncertain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person texture is architect-minded, synesthetic: "tents breathed like lungs," "colour grammar"—pattern taught by paragraph two and paid off in graffiti syntax. Rhythm modulates under pressure—long cadenced clauses for carnival roll, staccato for consultant encounters. No dialogue convergence; liaison’s corporate lyricism intentionally jars with Nessa’s ledger-poetry. Psychic distance stable; no filter-verb stacks; chip/fossil perception stays biased to her planner-tinkerer worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence propulsion high: "We sent instructions through messages encoded…" packs method, motive, and world-specific noun in one breath. Mixed-metaphor risk ("tide that buys new paint") is justified by sustained monetary-aqueous motif. Minor scaffold: "consultants nodded… said the market was speaking" re-states same beat; −0.2. No loops in closure paragraph; final image crystallises without verbal clutter. Rhythm is read-aloud musical without algorithmic patterning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating carnival-as-city and colour-coded graffiti flow-engineering synthesise familiar gentrification critique into fresh nautical grammar. Spiral chip transforming from childhood talisman to contract seal feels inevitable yet un-telegraphed. Dual-allegiance trope is personalised through sibling solder vs. lighting-grid split, avoiding generic class-struggle template. Risk of lyrical mosaic pays off via taught pattern and coherent closure; concept never retreats into safe metaphor but keeps material stakes live.</comment>
