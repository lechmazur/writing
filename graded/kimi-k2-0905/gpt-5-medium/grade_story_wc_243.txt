<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archivist’s “preserve small moments” motive is concrete from line 1 and steers every micro-choice; interiority stays sensory (“salt behind my eyes”) not diagnostic. No contradictory impulse under pressure—passivity is intentional yet costs remain felt (stepping back, sealing with salt). Relationship crucible is off-stage; woman & man are secondary, so status/pressure bullets NA. Meets 9+ test only if renunciation carried higher visible price; still, motive→action alignment is exemplary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the reopened locket reweights the entire covenant via recovered proximities; cost is the archivist’s exile from their dyad and the salted page—felt on page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sensory cascade to final “patient ledger of foam.” Orientation anchored by line 4, no late lens break. 0.3 off because “footsteps at landward end” coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve—could feel engineered; still, it pays off the thrift/rust image seeded early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Jetty, tide, thrift, barnacles, and warm plank micro-settings are turned into decision triggers (where boards warmest = where date is remembered). Locket photo doubles as mobile setting that re-anchors context shift. Sensory hierarchy obeys archivist’s taxonomic gaze—salt, rust, ink—never tourist catalog. Final image of foam ledger constrains future archive work—meets 9+ test. Minus 0.2 for one soft “place that” phrase; otherwise specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake = can the covenant’s map be recovered before tide erases it; tightening occurs when photo background matches live rail—options narrow to reunion or permanent loss. Escalation is textural: accretion of recalled micro-moments (thermos, scar, joke) increases emotional density until external coincidence (his arrival) crystallizes stance. Cost visible in narrator’s self-exile and salted seal. Lacks persistent constraint that would shape future tactics, preventing 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motif of proximate causes → small moments → tidal archive; never stated. Final salted page is non-literal answer to “can records repair?”—archive accepts stewardship of absence. Subtext in locket clicks, shoulder slant, silence before names. Ambiguity stays viable: covenant may still sink. Avoids final moral; resonance is imagistic. Hairline off for one near-epiphany “meaning takes on a habitable shape” which edges abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a perceptual signature: walnut ink breath, gull as “white parenthesis,” time measured in tides not minutes. Rhythm swells and ebbs with surf cadence; elliptical grammar taught early (“I did not repair, I remembered”) and paid off. No head-hop; distance tightens under euphoric haunt. Dialogue minimal yet distinct: woman’s breathy ellipses vs. archivist’s causal clauses. Meets 9+ quick test with pressure-proof rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often = sensory anchor + metaphor + causal nudge (“barnacles wrote their blunt alphabets”). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. Two adjacent “where” clauses in final paragraph create mild template cadence—−0.3. Otherwise scaffold-free, no synonym churn. Read-aloud ear test passes; clauses breathe like wave periods. Closure line unsullied by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—“archivist restores love via micro-memories while refusing to reunite”—is fresh synthesis of memory-fiction tropes. Risky lyric accumulative structure taught by 25% mark and pays off. Locket-as-clock and salted seal are specific, non-transferable images. Could use tighter occupational underside (why walnut vs. sepia?) but transformation of familiar love-rupture into archival map feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
