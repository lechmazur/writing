<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The poet’s contradictory impulses—yearning to anchor beauty while bracing for imminent self-erasure—are dramatized in the penny-spending beat and the palm-to-chest gesture; the fear of becoming “a stranger to my own fire” is embodied, not labeled. Micro-choices (sorting pages into “secret geographies,” revealing the map) reveal values under pressure and foreclose the safer path of anonymity. Cost is visible: the approaching molt could void tonight’s labor, yet he persists. The only drag is late-introduced Lio, whose interiority is ventriloquized; this slightly blunts the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebuilt door’s click becomes an almost-promise, crystallizing the new library as lived resistance; cost is felt in the poet’s cracked persona and the skyline’s “teeth marks.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of copper, pages, and bodies builds until the final hush reweights the stake. Causality holds: each poetic object (pennies, tin, lantern) is handled, not teleported. Orientation is clear by line 20; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library’s ribs, sleeping-beast stacks, and fence-harp strings are tactile and POV-filtered; space tracks cleanly from alley to back-fence to newly hinged door. Weather (rain smell, graphite dawn) and micro-objects (belt-hinge, battery lantern) constrain choices—without the lantern, night-work stalls. The final image of skyline “teeth marks” recharges earlier “busted tarps,” proving setting evolution. Meets 9+ gate: refrigerator-panel door materially shapes the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the outlaw library before next molt—tightens when demolition notice rattles inside the tin; option foreclosure is dramatized as they commit to riveting “night to morning.” Agency: poet spends inked pennies and reads them aloud, Lio wires lantern; these choices narrow retreat. Cost is visible in poet’s cracking persona and skyline “teeth marks.” Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word span; no reversal, yet deepening satisfies lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: copper pennies as micro-currency of care, pages clipped like prayer flags—beauty forged without permission. Final image of “morning lifts a blue lid” reweights anarchy into shared stewardship; no moralizing statement. Subtext in silence: strangers catching poems on the wire implies literacy as quiet revolution. Resists tidy binary—beauty/anarchy remain fused, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a coherent, street-poet idiom—“copper syllables,” “city keeps stepping over”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the lantern-wiring beat. No head-hopping; Lio’s laugh “carrying the clink of keys” is observed, not internalized. Syntax mirrors molting anxiety through fragmentary predicates (“I sort… I empty… I watch…”). Non-standard punctuation (em-dash splice in “Take courage, one reads…”) is taught early and paid off in final penny rosary. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—lines twin image with action: “spill pennies inked with phrases we can spend on hesitating strangers.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent (fence-harp, skyline-teeth) and do not crowd high-pressure beats. Minor register lift in “luminous fracture of a pattern healing by surprise” is justified by poet’s own lexicon. Clean grammar, vivid verbs (“ghosting,” “exhales”), correct quote mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of vagrant poet + outlaw library + personality-molting body is fresh; premise could collapse into quirk but is grounded in copper-map logistics. Prison-library origin for friendship is non-obvious and seeds trust without flashback bloat. Final “practice until dawn” reconfigures beauty from noun to verb—conceptual turn earned by prior particulars. Risk: lyric density nears purple, yet rhythm justifies gamble; no derivative echoes detected.</comment>
