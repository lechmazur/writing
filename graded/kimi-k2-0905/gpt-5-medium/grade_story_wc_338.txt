<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s “shielded openness” and “methodically curious” traits are embodied in every micro-choice: listening before pinning, refusing to open the vault alone, deciding to frame the tear as a seam. Interiority is concrete (“felt cold air nick my fingertips”), contradictions held in scene rather than summarized. The final renunciation—leaving the saved hush in place—pays off the established flaw/virtue of cautious empathy with visible cost (the map wound stays exposed). No status dynamics or second-character pressure on stage, so relationship bullets correctly ignored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of silence, damp, and breath layers until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“In the hills…”). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the torn map hung “marking the saved hush” crystallizes options—travelers must decide where known ends. Cost is felt in the exposed tear and the parish’s tentative day-opening. Persistent constraint: the slit architecture that folds words into stone shapes all tactics. One causality quibble: the 1999 lime-bubble exactly under the map tear reads slightly lucky, but it is presented as discovered pattern, not coincidence that resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the map tear itself becomes the decisive environment that guides the narrator’s final aesthetic choice. Rain-scoured vault, shingled lean-to, and wind-threading slit are not backdrop but tools that enable/force the discovery and the saved hush. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the framer’s vocation—“listen before I pin”—so damp, lime, and pricked names gain occupational salience. Final image of the torn map hanging by the door recharges every prior sensory layer with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: interpret silence with empathy vs. risk of violating sealed memory. Pressure tightens when comparison of silent films reveals the lime-bubble door, forcing the choice to reopen. One meaningful deepening: the whispered chapel is found intact, but the cost is the irreversible exposure of its hush to parish eyes. Escalation is textural—each silence (film, vault, chapel) layers until the narrator’s refusal to test the hush with loud voices hands the cost to future travelers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrent silence-as-material: cartographers’ shrug, fresco breath, film quiet, stone slit that folds words. No explicit thesis; the final image of the torn map “marking the saved hush” reweights earlier silences into an ethic of restraint. Subtext in gesture: the verger’s shrug-that-failed-refusal mirrors the map tear—both seams where refusal meets consent. Ambiguity is productive: parish reopening “for the day, and then see” leaves the hush’s fate undecided, denying moral tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the framer’s noticing is tactile-auditory (“listen before I pin,” “cold air nick my fingertips”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, contracts under sensation (“We walked… rain moving across its slate like slow prayer”). No dialogue to judge; interior voice sustains rhythmic control without drumbeat. Patterned elision—elliptical film comparisons, shard jumps—taught early and paid off in the final quiet. POV modesty intact: no knowledge claimed beyond what a careful listener could infer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences fuse job craft, sensory data, and metaphor (“rain eats old limestone like a slow animal with a patient tongue”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent under the lens of patience and erosion; no mixed vehicles. Minor register lift—“purl,” “bevel”—fits the antiquarian speaker. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. One paraphrase ripple: “the parish heard its own forebears purl through the gaps” could compress, but it advances the sonic motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: silence as architectural material, map tear as ethic of exposed seams. Hinge of fresco vault + silent film comparison feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors risk: pricked name-dots in lime, sheep threading henge stones “like needles in old hands.” No trope recycling; pilgrimage-chart-as-wound motif is transformed through the framer’s craft. Slight deduction for recognizable “sealed chamber beneath church” gothic spine, but the breath-slit physics and film-research angle refresh it.</comment>
