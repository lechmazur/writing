<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tracer’s embodied interiority—“listening becomes a structure I can walk through”—is vivid and consistent; the micro-choice to walk the city against orders crystallizes his curiosity under pressure. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. compulsion) coexist in-scene, not in summary. Cost is legible: he forfeits institutional safety and absorbs others’ grief without shield. Voice remains singular; no stock therapeutic labels mar the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tracer’s guidance fuses three ruptured lives into one phone call, re-weighting his role from recorder to midwife of reunion; the cost is the ungovernable fog he must now keep breathing. Causal linkage holds throughout—each beat (aid pulse → gallery → man’s room) tightens options under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“at my desk…twilight”). No teleporting props; the hearing-aid’s battery life is an implicit ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and glass-walled gallery are not postcard backdrops; fog literally slides inside and blurs institutional boundaries, forcing the tracer to abandon protocol. Micro-setting—the aid warm as a “pocketed sparrow”—constrains gesture and supplies tactile immediacy. Spatial choreography is clean: lobby slide → photograph wall → back room, bodies tracked without impossible drift. Weather and architecture compress social distance between living and dead, charging the final hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—tightens when the caller proves to be a live child, not a dead one, forcing the tracer to risk job security. Escalation is accumulative: each pulse of the aid deepens the pattern and narrows the search map. Visible price: the headset pricks, the city answers only to feet, the gallery’s last photographs lean like exhausted mailmen—stakes made visceral. Coincidence (guard asleep) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the tracer’s listening-as-architecture: connectivity is an involuntary structure we must inhabit, not a service we control. Subtext lives in gesture—the man cupping his ear, the child swallowing—never in thesis statements. Final image of guiding two strangers to speak reweights “incidental heroism” as the residue of sustained attention rather than triumph. No moralizing line tells us listening saves; the silence after the connection does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice owns a distinct rhythmic signature: compressed metaphors (“steam sketches a question mark”) and synesthetic slips that feel like nervous-system spillover from too much listening. Perceptual signature is consistent—right-ear bias, catalog of devices, urban pulse—never drifting into committee lyric. Compression is taught early (“the room tightens into a reeling hush”) and paid off in the closing fog. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under pressure without syntactic fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level density is high—“pinging in the archive like a swallowed star” does image + foreshadowing + emotional charge in one sweep. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary from participial to noun-clause to fragment without drumbeat. Mixed metaphor risk is contained: “aid needles a darker room” keeps physical logic consistent. Final paragraph slows syntax to match the hush, propelling without drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: contact-tracing ghosts through obsolete hearing aids turns bureaucratic surveillance into elegiac caretaking. The right-ear motif personalizes a tech artifact, avoiding generic ghost-story lamps. Risky mosaic glide from atrium to river to gallery pays off when the photograph reframes the mother’s laugh as tenderness, not impairment. Conceptual integrity commits fully—no safety retreat to “it was all a dream.”</comment>
