<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s interior contradiction—devotion to the trees versus erasure of self—drives every micro-choice. The ghost bride’s pressure forces him to confront the cost of his farmer-heart neglect, culminating in the earned stasis of hanging the bead. Emotions live in body: graft scars “quiver like a closed eye learning light.” Voice remains singular, lyrical, and grounded; no stock phrasing intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bead’s chimed silence reweights the entire orchard’s dark, making the keeper’s future vigil legible as lifelong cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each apparition thickens pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night”); disorientation later pays off when the orchard itself “warms its own dark.” All transitions are legible shard-breaks; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass walls, graft scars, and the bead-anchored doorway constrain every tactic. Winter-cracked fields outside act as counter-pressure, making the internal night feel chosen rather than imposed. Sensory hierarchy follows the keeper’s priorities: soil warmth, sap scent, chime timbre. Final image—the bead hung in the doorway—recharges every prior pane-reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can the keeper accept that awakening the trees demands perpetual self-wakefulness? Escalation is textural: each apparition adds density until silence itself becomes the tightening. The carved bead’s drop quivers graft scars—an on-page reversal that forecloses the option of remaining asleep. Cost is visible: he must guard the night orchard forever, trading personal dawn for theirs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of repayment: the bride repays being saved by forcing the saver to remember the act’s erasure. Subtext lives in gesture—her veil loosening “with the relief of someone finishing a long letter.” Final image answers the thematic question: memory ferments into salted star-fruit, implying that remembrance itself is the only harvest. No sermonizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice owns a distinct syntactic heartbeat: long breathless clauses that break into fragments under pressure (“Say it, she told me…”). Diction stays inside the keeper’s lexicon—no academic register drift. Patterned elision (“she unfastened her wrist, or the memory of a wrist”) is taught early and paid off when she vanishes “as a note disappears by becoming the ears.” No head-hopping; even the bride’s voice is filtered through his perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs three jobs—atmosphere, backstory, and causality (“That was the first of the resonant awakenings, not bell but reply to being called”). Figurative language is controlled: no mixed metaphors, no stacked modifiers in peak beats. Rhythm accelerates at pruning lesson, then breathes at bead-hanging. Zero loops, zero scaffold, zero filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—night orchard awakened by ghost bride repaying forgotten river rescue—feels inevitable in hindsight yet startling on first read. The alchemical greenhouse grafts literal horticulture onto afterlife commerce without explaining either. Risk: lyric mosaic structure could have diffused pressure; instead, accumulative apparitions tighten toward silence-as-fruit. Fresh inflection: repayment exacted by making the savior remember his own forgetting.</comment>
