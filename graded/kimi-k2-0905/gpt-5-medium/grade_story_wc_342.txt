<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s face-blindness is more than label: it dictates the “edges and weights” method used to read the coin and paint the sky, linking perception to action. Interiority stays concrete—charcoal on skin, glaze choosing its path—rather than abstract. The final renunciation (signing with the coin, accepting the mural may outlast him) carries visible cost in the tightening stillness and the dust settling on wet paint. Micro-choices—testing blue until it fractures, matching coin arcs to rings—reveal a hierarchy of values (art over escape) under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mural’s dawn glows inside the fallen trunk, reweighting the premise that sky needs windows. Causality holds: coin → atlas → pigment → mural → survival, each step because/therefore. Orientation is taught early (“the hush arrives… condemned building waits”) and pays off when the blast folds the tent. Cost is legible in the last line—“quiet as a pulse, bright as a promise”—the lived pulse now belongs to the tree, not the artist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tree-trunk library functions as micro-setting: its carved rings become the star map the coin must fit, directly constraining the final beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys the POV—grain is read like shoulders, not faces—keeping detail character-bound. Spatial choreography is clean: coin lifted, notch found, atlas shivers loose, all trackable. Weather vials labeled “colors of weather” evolve from prop to pigment to sky, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“mirror the sky inside walls before the building dies”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens when the foreman’s radio begins its countdown. Escalation is situational: stillness thickens, dust trembles, time compresses into “one more minute.” The mural becomes the last live option; failing to finish means the tree forgets the sky. Cost is visible: the artist trades escape for glaze layers, choosing to stay inside the folding tent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of blindness: inability to read faces becomes the gift for reading grains, coins, skies—limits repurposed as vision. No moral is stated; the reweighting happens in the final image where “the dawn still glows on the bark,” proving memory can outlive eyesight. Subtext in the letter—“discover your limits here, and put them in the paint”—is lived, not lectured. Complexity lingers: survival is partial (tree, not building) and ambiguous (artist may be buried, mural remains).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric first-person sustains a hushed, breath-held cadence that mirrors the countdown. Syntax fragments (“Layer by layer…”) mimic glaze settling; longer sentences swell like storm fronts. Perceptual signature is distinct: sky has “shoulders,” coin dimples are “cooled rain on stone.” No head-hopping; register stays within an artist’s lexicon without art-speak drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned—fractal arcs, vine/forest echo—taught early and reprised at closure, earning its keep. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Strong verbs (“shivers loose,” “fractures into chalk”) replace modifiers. One register spike—“Conceptual Repricing” lens—but the phrase is the evaluator’s, not the text’s; the line itself uses concrete pulse/promise pairing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—tree-library awaiting demolition, sky painted on bark—feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Face-blindness as cartographic gift reframes disability as aesthetic method without pamphleteering. Risk of lyric stillness across 800 words pays off: the hush becomes a character. Synthesis of coin-star-map + growth-rings + weather-pigment is specific enough to resist name-swapping.</comment>
