<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iri’s interior contradiction—ledger vs. lullaby—is dramatized in every beat (handling the crystal, refusing her formulas, ribbon tied to branch). The final renunciation of reciting formulas is earned by the orchard’s sensory feedback and starling stillness, so the cost feels lived. Micro-choices (kneeling to flame, sliding reliquary under roots) reveal value hierarchy with visible stakes. Slight softness: “secretly sentimental” is declared twice rather than revealed solely through action; ribbon beat helps but still leans label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the orchard root-breath freezes time, reconfigures meaning, and leaves Iri in crystallized balance. Causal chain holds—each starling pattern tightens options until she abandons the formula recital. Accumulative lens is taught early (color → orchard → starlings) and paid off when copper light fuses hair, tone, and decision. Cost is legible in the reliquary’s final white breath and the hollow starling question: she forfeits certainty for symbiosis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the reliquary, flame-cup, and copper waterfall beam constrain every tactical choice. Kaleidoscopic waterfall is never decorative—its six moods of light meter Iri’s internal clock and final color shift signals closure. Spatial choreography pristine: we track her path from veil entrance → root nest → grass press without drift. Orientation anchor (“auburn-haired alchemist stepped through the mist”) lands at word 14; no penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard’s survival vs. personal formulaic control—is signaled in paragraph 4. Single meaningful tightening: starlings freeze mid-flight, forcing her to drop the formulas; this is the decisive trade-off. Cost is visible in the white root-breath that sacrifices her analytic certainty. Under accumulative lens, density of color-mood-starling repetitions reweights stakes without causal reversals; one decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete polarity: frozen crystal (logic) vs. sap surge (intuition) resolved in the copper glow that marries both. No explicit thesis; final image of “balance” is implied by empty starling hollow and taste of tart-then-generous fruit. Subtext in ribbon gesture—asking orchard to witness—silently redefines knowledge as communal covenant. Avoids sentimental profundity; wisdom stays embodied in taste and earth pulse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric oracle: long syntactic braids mimic kaleidoscope, then fracture into short beats under starling stillness. Diction stays within alchemical lexicon—“reliquary,” “tinctured,” “theorem”—without jarring elevation. Perceptual signature is color-synesthetic: every noun attracts a hue, reinforcing POV bias. No dialogue, so no head-hop risk; compression (“laugh like seeds spilling”) teaches pattern early and pays off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence shifts from waterfall rush to ember hush, mirroring scene pulse. Metaphors are stacked but patterned (waterfall moods, starling calligraphy) so density reads as design, not clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new sensory angle or causal cue. Minor tic: “braided” appears three times in first third—accepted under pattern-teach rule; payoff visible when orchard braids frost and blossom at close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fantasy orchard + starling divination + alchemical crystal is fresh synthesis; none are stock motifs in this configuration. Starling semaphore as living calculus transforms familiar nature imagery into epistemic tool. Risk taken: renunciation of explicit spell-casting in favor of ecological pact—avoids tidy power fantasy. Specific inflection: copper hair tied to copper waterfall light fuses character and world in a way extractable names could not replicate.</comment>
