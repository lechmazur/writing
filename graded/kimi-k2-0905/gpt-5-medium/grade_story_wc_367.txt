<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is vivid, but interiority is more atmospheric than contradictory; the child’s arrival shifts caretaking into action, yet her agency is off-stage. The “storm herald” persona stays lyrical rather than pressure-tested; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs the narrator custody or identity. Earned stasis is implied—keep transmitting—but the emotional price is gestured, not embodied. Voice is singular, but secondary pressure from the child is under-choreographed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lighthouse vows to “keep its emerald vow to tomorrow,” a conceptual repricing that reframes the entire vigil as futile yet necessary; cost is the eternal loop of accidental prophecy. Accumulative/textural lens holds: repetition of “laugh,” “steer,” “total internal reflection” tightens the pattern until the final beam reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early—“under stars after the last print newspaper folded”—so disorientation serves lyric design. One shard only; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Emerald glass foundation, silica wick, and mirror angles are tactile and constrain how light can be “steered”; micro-setting = optical spine. Sensory hierarchy honors the POV—silica “drinks light like rain”—and reef edges receive calligrapher focus. Weather is partner, not backdrop: storm breath edits the beam. Final image of “phosphor and wind” printing us recharges the bottle-bones setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: keep the beam true post-newsprint silence; pressure deepens when the child arrives—new cargo to keep safe. Escalation is situational: storm, drones, and mythic weather ratchet vigilance, but no option is foreclosed; the tower never considers abandonment. Cost is diffuse—endless nights, swallowed headlines—never localized into one felt forfeiture. Tightening is cadence, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as endurance media: after print dies, light becomes the newspaper no press can smear. Motif of “ancient shadows” re-illuminates reefs and child-ink, culminating in “weathered joy” headline. Final image reweights prophecy from curse to caretaking without moralizing. Subtext in storm laughter keeps sentimentality at bay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: narrator notices optics, obsolete delivery whistles, antenna-gulls. Syntax flexes from liquid long sentences to clipped “the tower purrs.” No head-hopping; child’s interior stays opaque, preserving POV modesty. Free indirect style cleanly fuses “I tell the child” with collective “we publish guidance in beams.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm built on anaphora (“I tell,” “we burn,” “the storm laughs”) that accelerates like light down the spine. Metaphors stay physical—light as bell, laughter as ballast—no mixed vehicle collisions. Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadowed elation,” “weathered joy”) verge on ornament but pattern-teach the tone. No loops or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-journalism with lighthouse-as-newsroom, steering prophecy through optics; synthesis feels inevitable. “Total internal reflection” literalized as editorial process is fresh without gimmickry. Risk of lyric overload is flirted but held by storm-dialogue counterweight. Not quite 9.0 because the child’s arc is more symbol than lived complication.</comment>
