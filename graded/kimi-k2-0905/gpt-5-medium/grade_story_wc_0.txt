<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet, methodical stance is credibly rooted in her scientific training; her decision to “strip needless drama” and start sweeping is a micro-choice that costs her the comfort of grand narrative. Interiority stays concrete—she kneels, traces a spiral, smiles at the slide—never sliding into label-speak. The only soft spot is that the internal contradiction (grief vs. pragmatism) is mentioned more than it is enacted in body or breath; still, the closing image of her blowing the slide clean shows earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final breath across the slide reweights the whole story’s rule-set—data and dust are equivalently readable if attended to patiently. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sweep and traced swirl is a beat that deepens pattern rather than causally reversing plot. Orientation is clean by line 3 (who/where/when). No causal break; the only nit is that the “invite colleagues” moment is summarized, not dramatized, slightly softening the cost immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s broken panes, silted tiles, and punctured roof constrain every action—she can’t replant, only calibrate. Butterfly dust under the lens becomes themicro-setting that charges the final image; its vanes literally filter the light that glows the room. Sensory hierarchy is scientist-cold: particles, cracks, arithmetic of compost—never touristy. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or prop drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she read damage without melodrama—tightens when she chooses sweeping over mourning; each stroke narrows her options from rescue to calibration. Escalation is Accumulative: grime patterns replace starquake graphs, reweighting the stake with visible patience-cost. No external antagonist is needed; the flood’s residue is coherent pressure. The final plastic-sheet patch is a small, credible trade-off that forecloses full repair, paying the price on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: recovery is a rehearsal, not a redemption—shown via parallel patience toward stars and seedlings. The butterfly-dust reprise at the end reweights prior motif without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing spirals, chalking waterlines—never in thesis statements. Only a faint echo of “theater of prediction” flirt-s with overt thesis, but it’s anchored in her prior professional flaw, so the abstraction feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is scientist-precise yet lyric: “patient ledger,” “earthly arithmetic,” “kindled humility” stay within a neutron-star researcher’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long accumulative sentences mirror gradualism; short clauses (“kneel, observe, adjust, repeat”) mimic protocol. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—she sees vortices in dust, starquakes in cracked glass. Compression like “data breathed without theatrics” is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences open with concrete nouns, shift to participle phrases only when mirroring slow accretion. No scaffold loops; each line adds either sensory grain or causal push. Figurative language is controlled—one metaphor per beat, none stacked. Information density is high: “tomatoes gone to filaments” does world, loss, and biologic decay in five words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophysics and greenhouse reclamation feels inevitable, not gimmicky—both operate on micro-variations over time. Butterfly dust as data-sample is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that would collapse if swapped with generic silt. The “practice of noticing” reframes climate and cosmic grief simultaneously. Risk is quiet, but the refusal of rescue melodrama is boldly unsensational.</comment>
