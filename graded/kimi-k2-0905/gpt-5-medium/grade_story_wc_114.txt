<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Protagonist’s interior monologue is concrete (“small stone star” rattling each step), but the single on-page relationship (oracle-visitor) stays largely didactic; no status shift shown. Motive to “unwrite” the lie through bodily balance is tracked, but the final release feels off-loaded to oracle guidance rather than earned micro-choice; renunciation cost is visible yet not fully interiorized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gentian map reweights the lie, physical stance and scale stand-in for absolution, cost legible (“tension leaves my shoulders”). Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (soot, tea, antenna hum) adds density until final crystallization; causality intact, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Station environment directly shapes tactics: platform edge tests stance, scale weighs breath, anemometer lee hosts paper fulcrum. Weather instruments recur with each reflection beat, constraining movement and supplying metaphors that converge in closure; micro-setting (paper, glass) becomes continent map—no 8.8 cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from abstract guilt to embodied balance test; soot-marked fulcrum literalizes “sway” and forecloses avoidance. Oracle’s request to speak “from margins” forces public naming, cost felt via tremoring paper and storm onset—one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of calcified truths vs living uncertainty emerges through repeated “sway”/“balance” motifs rather than statement; final image of folded gentian map offers non-literal answer, reprice carried silence. No final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: synesthetic color (“tea the color of rain charts”), mechanical metaphors for grief, rhythmic coordination of breath with metal hum. Compression and ellipses taught by line one, paid off in storm cadence; no head-hop, psychic distance contracts cleanly under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“galvanized rooms stitched to stone”) advance both image and affect; varied sentence openers, no filters at climax. One mixed-metaphor risk (“towers with tired knees”) but physical logic holds; no loops, artifacts absent from closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mountain oracle as grief-engineer, scale-as-confessional, botanical print as mutable testimony—synthesis specific to voice. Transformation test passes: replace gentian/soot with generic prop and closure collapses. Risk of lyric density is rewarded because clarity preserved.</comment>
