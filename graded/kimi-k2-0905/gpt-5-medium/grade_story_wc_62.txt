<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The carver’s interiority is textured through haptic micro-choices—testing ribbon, tapping chisel, pacing letter depth; these reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. mercy, ornament vs. silence) coexist in scene, not summary. The mother’s spectral mentorship externalizes an internal limit: “names want enough silence to grow around them,” a credo that visibly constrains his hand. Closure is an Earned Stasis: he accepts perpetual incompletion, the price legible in the spare kite-curve that ends the sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly returns, widening grief-rings, ribbon notches, and butterfly landings accrete until meaning reweights. Closure is Charged Poise—the final stone holds the kite-curve, crystallizing options without sentimental payoff. Orientation is swift: dusk, greenhouse bench, marble slab named within 40 words. One meaningful tightening: father’s hand steadies only after he chooses his daughter’s poem; that micro-turn reconfigures carving depth and emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse ribs “singing like tide,” condensation “small planets,” dirt path glowing “as if the floor remembered sunlight” are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain action: the singing glass accepts each chisel tap as a measured tide, determining carving rhythm. The cracked roof and lettuce beds provide spatial staging for the father’s steadied breath; butterfly feet on syllables literalize the setting’s veto power over ornament. Final image: kite-curve cut shallow into marble under a sky “ash gold,” environment and object fused into one charged micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to let collective grief breathe without breaking it—tightens through each stone: seafarer, daughter, unnamed next. Agency is renunciation: carver accepts perpetual incompleteness, refusing to trap grief in fixed form. Cost is visible on-page: father’s hand steadies only after poem-verse is chosen, and carver’s last stroke is “single spare,” relinquishing flourish. Migration clock supplies external pressure, but escalation remains internal—depth of cut, not speed of plot—sufficient for accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: grief migrates in widening rings, stones must bear distances like maps; no character states the thesis. Ribbon, butterflies, and kite-curve reweight meaning at closure without symbolic convenience. Father’s choice of daughter’s kite poem integrates private memory into public monument, enacting the dinner-table custom organically. Final image resists moral: spare curve equals open sky, implying that remembrance stays airborne, unfinished—an earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person voice sustains lapidary syntax—short, chiseled clauses mirroring stone work. Perceptual signature is haptic and sonic: “glass ribs singing,” “measured tide,” “syllable to soften.” No head-hopping; mother’s spectral voice arrives as wind or butterfly foot, maintaining POV modesty. Register stays within carver’s artisan lexicon; no corporate drift. Final sentence cadence—one ash-gold evening—mirrors the kite’s single spare curve, rhythmic payoff taught early by ribbon’s notched lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or choice; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (glass = tide, butterflies = commas) without contradiction. Minor scaffold: “I am a thoughtful gravestone carver” could be shown faster, but interiority deepens immediately. No artifacts in closure beat; final kite-curve line is clean, rhythmic, legible under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—carving grief into stone while letting it breathe—is fresh, not template. Butterfly migration as grief-clock transforms familiar eco-image into structural loom. Spectral mentorship via wind/butterflies avoids cliché ghost dialogue. Risk: lyric density could obscure, but pattern taught by ribbon notches keeps closure legible. Specificity of artisan procedure (testing marble with poem-ribbon) resists generic “artist” story.</comment>
