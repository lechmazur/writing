<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s “analytically intuitive” curse/compass is concrete in every beat—threading fragment to canvas, decoding murals, feeling “the tug of her mind.” Arson-to-rebirth motivation escalates cleanly; the final carried portrait is earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority avoids label-speak; volcanic tenderness is shown via soot lifting, seeds writing names. Minor slip: no second on-page character, so relationship crucible unused, but single-POV pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the seeds rewrite the ledger of gratitude across the floor, reframing the arson as primer, ruin as vow kept—cost felt in “heart hammering” and “wholly undone.” Causal lens holds: because I torched the library, therefore the archive’s paint loosens, allowing the new text to emerge. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“beneath the dunes”). No artifact muddles the final image; the living sentence lands with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Archive body—feather-choked stair, salt-shivering murals, wolves-circle desk—constrains each micro-choice and charges the final planting. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: patterns before décor, touch before vista. Spatial choreography clean: fragment→canvas→stair→vault→atrium track is legible. The broken oculus wind that germinates seeds is the setting altering tactics and image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep readers safe by keeping their names secret—tightens when the ledger of names is physically germinated; a new public text replaces the hidden one, foreclosing anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each artwork adds density until the final sprouting reweights the stake. Cost is visible—soot skin peeled, seeds eyes-open—but could be sharper; “heart hammering” is the only embodied price. Agency persists throughout; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: preservation through destruction, love through anonymity. The fire-as-primer image reconfigures moral arithmetic; no moral is declared. Final image of names written by seeds onto wind offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence—no reader names are spoken, only grown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person texture is distinct: syntax mirrors analytical intuition—“I aligned fragment to canvas, and a corridor overlay appeared.” Rhythm breathes with pressure: short bursts under soot-lifting, longer coils during mural reading. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within POV lexicon; “volcanic tenderness” is earned through prior imagery, not ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence variety and muscular verbs—“sunlight knifed,” “seeds opened like small eyes”—propel without purple overload. One template cadence risk: three consecutive “I [verb]” opens mid-text, but pattern is broken before closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles (kiln, river, seed-eyes) cohere. Information density high; every paragraph advances image or causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—lending-library arson as archival preservation—feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Artistic-creation trail (mosaic, portrait, murals) synthesizes clue and ritual without checklist vibe. Volcanic tenderness trope is inverted: heat births text instead of erasure. Risk of lyric fragmentation paid off by coherent closure under causal lens.</comment>
