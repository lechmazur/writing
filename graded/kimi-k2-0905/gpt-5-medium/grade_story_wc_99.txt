<comment>The bonsai tutor’s interior contradiction—wanting to prune storms yet fearing their own unspoken storm—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of “shaping storms into cages” is earned by the cove confession and costs the mentor identity. Embodied regret (compass clicks like a throbbing tooth) keeps emotion off the therapy couch. Only nit: the leap from tracing lace to “walk clockwise” feels slightly under-motivated, a hairline slip.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the upright needle and lace brightened to muted cerulean reconfigure the rule-set—apologies can be released but not retrieved—cost is the relinquishing of control itself. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salt-grass step deepens the pattern until the tide reweights meaning. Orientation is taught by the compass cue at word 60; no caps triggered. One of the cleanest 800-word arcs I’ve seen.</comment>

<comment>Driftwood “posture of twisted trunks” literally constrains the protagonist’s recognition of past pruning cruelty, charging the final image. Casuarina needles diffusing sky into “kinder shavings” filters POV bias of a tutor who miniaturizes vastness. Every environmental detail is tactile and stakes-shaping; no postcard filler. Micro-setting (lace square drinking tide) acts as mutable map—setting in miniature, perfectly apt.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can unspoken apologies be released without lying—tightens when lace drinks the cove: the option to keep words buried is literally absorbed away. Protagonist agency drives the turn: speaking aloud forecloses the mentor’s identity as silent shaper. Cost is immediate—compass hesitates, gull measures hush—pressure crystallizes without external coincidence. Sufficient escalation for 800-word lyric mode; one decisive intensification meets bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through shifting meaning of “pruning”: from violent control to humble listening. Cerulean regret recurs not as color but as condition—weather one wears—final diffusion into garden instruction reweights prior miniatures. No moralizing; the gull’s cocked head offers mute verdict. Subtext in lace pattern—navigator’s wife stitching unsayable routes—echoes tutor’s own unspoken map, paid off when lace is wrung out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is slow-spoken yet syntactically alive: “storms do not obey” clipped, “rhythmically placid” repeated like breathing metronome. Perceptual signature—seeing horizon as ‘cerulean glaze that would not crack’—is tutor-specific, not generic lyric. Compression taught early (“I spoke slowly so silence could root”) licenses later elisions without opacity. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens exactly once: at cove confession, sentences shorten, verbs strengthen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long tidal sentences to staccato release: “I spoke… set them to drift.” Figurative layering (compass as throbbing tooth, sea as larger lung) stays coherent within maritime corpus. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal data. Minor dock: “diffuse the sky into kinder shavings” risks mixed metaphor, but casuarina needles literally shave light, so physics holds.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of bonsai discipline with maritime ghost-compass is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight: both navigate growth through invisible forces. Lace-as-map reverses typical treasure chart: instructions are emotional, not geographic. Risk taken—800-word lyric collage with no antagonist—pays off because tide becomes coherent pressure. Transformation test fails if tutor is any other profession; bonsai specifics (wire left too long) anchor metaphor.</comment>
