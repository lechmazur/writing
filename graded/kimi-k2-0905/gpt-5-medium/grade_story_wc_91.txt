<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—needing to stage-manage “accidental” prophetic fulfillment while disavowing vanity—drives every beat; the embodied shame when elders thank her crystallizes cost. Micro-choices (jar-placement, breathing mimic) tether motive to action; no stock phrases. Final renunciation of the bugs shows earned stasis with visible price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: jar-line density increases, night hush pattern breaks with sideways ash exhalation, reweighting village safety stake. Closure—lightning stars released—earns resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: her anonymity sacrificed to living prophecy. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Black sand grains, tide against calf, basalt shelf under bottles—tactile specifics constrain placement and stand-in for micro-setting. Night shimmer and salt air narrow perception to breathing rhythm, charging final image. Setting directly shapes evacuation choreography; no scenic filler.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—pre-empt volcano panic—tightens when bottle arc becomes rehearsal for ash exhalation; cost is her vanishing into myth. One meaningful deepening: scientist’s toe-line re-labels tremor from threat to restraint. Agency remains Mara’s orchestration; coincidence complicates, does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “useful kindness disguised as chance” emerges through jar choreography, not exposition; released bugs re-price prophecy as communal safety rather than ego. Final image reframes light as shared responsibility, avoiding moral tidy-up. Subtext in fisherman’s elders line nods to myth without endorsing it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person retains consistent perceptual signature: tide-chosen detour, sand remembering, mountain learning to breathe. Syntax mirrors hush—long vowels, comma-rolled clauses—without monotony. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic (“lend its own hush”), advances subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene—short beats for bottle drops, lengthened sentences for celestial crawl. Metaphors stay coherent (tidal fingers / raft) and pay off. No scaffold loops; information dense (“gave away coincidence”). Proofing clean, pronoun track perfect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: disaster-preparedness staged as prophetic firefly breadcrumb trail; accidental myth-making inverted into civic ritual. Specificity of donated childhood bugs keeps trope from abstraction. Risk—quiet evacuation without eruption spectacle—pays off in sideways ash plume image that feels inevitable.</comment>
