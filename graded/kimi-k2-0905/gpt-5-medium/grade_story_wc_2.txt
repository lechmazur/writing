<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The interior voice is specific, poetically compressed, and consistent—"time flinches when touched," "brass teaches: improvise with patience." The arc from exactness-chaser to cascade-listener is credibly embodied; cost is the abandoned old workshop ethos. Minor deduction: the "uncertainly certain" tag is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices, but the climatic stance crystallization still lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the new "clock of water" braids cascade and compass, reweighting the premise—planning as friendship, not cage. Every beat obeys a tight because/therefore linkage (compass tug → alley → hatch → cataract → water-clock) under a Causal lens; the price—renouncing certainty—is legible in the final line. No teleporting props; journal and key pay off set-ups. High-band gate met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-settings (compass, waterfall-hewn room, spoon-and-droplet gear) constrain every tactical move; spoon placement literally changes time's sound. Sensory hierarchy is biased to the POV’s tinkerer eye—gears, cinders, resin-coated ink. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. The cataract’s "storms imprisoned" scent and mirrored limestone physically guide the step-through timing, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator relinquish control to irregular time?—tightens when cascade spray punishes miscount. One decisive reversal: abandons "rebuilding" for "letting breathe," cost paid by leaving oils and warm cinders behind. Escalation is continuous, lens-honest, with visible price; coincidence complicates but never rescues. Slight reserve: waterfall peril is briefly abstract before the step-timing beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image and action: exactitude vs. organic flux. The spoon-and-water clock is the non-literal answer—planning re-imagined as listening friendship. No moralizing, just reweighted premise. Motif of "ashes" migrates from destruction to germination without exposition; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakably singular—compressed metaphor, mechanical diction fused with lyric pulse: "the waterfall kept time with a kindness brutal enough to teach." Perceptual signature never slips; even abstraction ("time flinches") is anchored in brass and droplet. POV distance stable; free-indirect tension intact. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext successfully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm accelerates into cataract scene, then breathes with water-clock assembly; sentence variance supports urgency. No scaffold loops; each line advances image or causality. Figurative density is high but patterned early ("clock bones," "constellation eyelids") and pays off. Tiny register peek—"conceptual repricing" notionally meta—keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes steampunk salvage, subterranean waterfall lair, and anti-plan manifesto into an inevitable whole. The compass rose remade from sextants feels freshly specific; water-powered clock is organic not gimmick. Risk—lyric causality—heightens stakes without clarity loss. Slight echo of secret-under-greenhouse trope nudges down; nonetheless angle and voice transcend cliché.</comment>
