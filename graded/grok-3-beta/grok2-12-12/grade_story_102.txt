<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the dollhouse key and prophecy resolution lacks logical depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite incorporating assigned elements; the style lacks clarity, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
