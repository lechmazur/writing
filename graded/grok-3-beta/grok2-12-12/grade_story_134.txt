<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the salt crystal growing chamber is intriguing and supports the magical tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's dread or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story lacks strong emotional impact or subtext; while the concept of waking the unheard is interesting, itâ€™s told rather than shown, and the ending feels predictable rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Writing feels somewhat formulaic with generic descriptors of dread and whispers; lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, relying on stated feelings rather than showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
