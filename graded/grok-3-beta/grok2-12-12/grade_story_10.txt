<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's cheerless nature and fatal flaw of perfectionism are present, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her transformation through forgiveness is stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the mutated recipes and forgiveness feels forced and lacks logical grounding; pacing is uneven, with the resolution feeling rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport customs office and server room hum create an intriguing backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the maggoty chest or Elara's motivation feels superficial rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact with themes of forgiveness, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing; literary devices like imagery are present but not striking, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the concept of mutated recipes offers a glimmer of originality, the narrative leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels surface-level, and the writing lacks a distinct, individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
