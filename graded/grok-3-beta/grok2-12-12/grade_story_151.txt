<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation shifts from rational detachment to emotional awakening, but the transition feels abrupt and lacks depth in internal conflict; the astronomer's voice is indistinct and lacks unique personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced within the word limit; connections between snowflake patterns and moral dilemmas are tenuous, disrupting coherence and pacing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing relies on somewhat generic metaphors (snowflake as hope) and lacks fresh subversions of tropes; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; lacks a lingering depth or truly creative synthesis of ideas.</comment>
