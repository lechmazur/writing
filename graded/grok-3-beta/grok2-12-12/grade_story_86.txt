<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's apprehension is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, and her motivation feels generic despite the noble intent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent with a clear arc, but the resolution feels abrupt and overly simplistic, lacking depth in cause-effect relationships within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center setting is evocative and ties to the tone of borrowed dawn, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; while imagery like the candle and arrow is present, the central conflict and theme of compassion feel forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clich√©d phrases and predictable cyberpunk tropes; metaphors like "borrowed dawn" are overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style lacks clarity and depth for a lasting impression.</comment>
