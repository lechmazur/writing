<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elise's morally ambiguous nature is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict; her motivation to corner an elusive destiny feels vague and lacks specificity, failing to create a compelling character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and lacks depth in cause-and-effect relationships; the sudden shift from grocery shopping to the tower is abrupt and undermines coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower setting is intriguing but underutilized with minimal sensory detail; the atmosphere of "gentle chaos" is repeatedly stated rather than evoked, missing opportunities to enhance mood or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The story lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; the central conflict is superficial, and the writing relies on telling rather than showing, with no memorable literary devices or impactful style to elevate it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it lacks cohesion and depth; the style is overly simplistic, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving no lingering impact.</comment>
