<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Father Elias's stage fright is mentioned but not deeply explored as a shaping force in his actions or personality; his motivation to confront family lies feels somewhat generic and lacks specificity in emotional depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between toy assembly and unlocking truth feels forced and underdeveloped; pacing is uneven, with the climax rushed and lacking clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is visually striking and complements the defiant tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels superficial rather than integral to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism of lies and truth, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels predictable and lacks a lingering resonance or strong subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the setting is unusual, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of family secrets without subversion; metaphors like "ashes of never" feel overwrought, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, relying on stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from forced connections and a lack of depth; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
