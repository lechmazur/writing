<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Amara's confusion as a diplomat is present but lacks depth; her motivation to liberalize feels surface-level and not fully explored within the word limit. Her interaction with the computer key reveals little beyond a symbolic gesture, and her voice remains indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Amara's shift in perspective, but the action of liberalizing feels vague and unresolved. Pacing is uneven, with too much focus on internal reflection, disrupting narrative momentum within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and generic. The connection between the setting and the computer key feels forced, and the tone's alignment with the concept is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with the computer key and birds, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing. The ending lacks punch, and the central conflict of liberalization remains underdeveloped. Theme is present but not sharply conveyed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative feels somewhat formulaic, relying on predictable introspection without fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion. Sensory details are generic, and the tone shifts slightly, lacking a distinct authorial style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is moderate, but the story feels built around assigned elements rather than using them organically. Style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate. Lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
