<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to wield improbable power is clear, but his personality as an underwater welder lacks depth or distinctiveness; his actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and cause-effect relationships between button presses and timeline shifts are vague, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The setting of a broken planetarium as a night club is evocative and ties well to the tone of inherited mystery, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
