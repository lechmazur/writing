<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sam's ability to see ghosts is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation for liberation feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed; connections between ghost tours, sand lab, and personal growth are tenuous and lack strong cause-effect logic within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The sand castle lab setting is unique but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere doesn't fully support the dissonance of silence or emotional depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, execution feels formulaic with predictable ghost-as-wisdom trope; emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes gaps in depth and lingering impact.</comment>
