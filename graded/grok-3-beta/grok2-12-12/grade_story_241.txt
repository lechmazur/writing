<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the soft-voiced guide lacks depth beyond a descriptive trait, and the narrator's motivation feels vague and ungrounded despite first-person perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the narrative arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with unclear cause and effect between the blackout and the scream of silent plains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating cloud cafe setting is evocative and supports the ethereal tone, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and connection to character motivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused ethereal tropes and generic descriptors; metaphors like "blissful agony" feel forced and lack nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style leans toward overwrought without clarity or lasting impact.</comment>
