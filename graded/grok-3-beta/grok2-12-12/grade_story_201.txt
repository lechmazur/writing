<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lila's impulsiveness and whimsical nature are present but feel surface-level; her motivation to restore her great-grandmother's legacy is clear but lacks depth or internal conflict to make her truly compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tracking shooting stars and the resolution feels tenuous and underdeveloped; pacing is rushed at the climax, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of restless harmony, with sensory details like the roar of water enhancing mood; however, the integration of dusk feels more decorative than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through music and legacy, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful but lacks a deeper subtext or lingering impact beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative feels formulaic, relying on predictable tropes of rediscovery and restoration without subversion; metaphors like shooting stars are generic, and emotional expression lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it feels constructed around them rather than using them organically; the brief length feels limiting, and the overall impact lacks depth or a lingering question for the reader.</comment>
