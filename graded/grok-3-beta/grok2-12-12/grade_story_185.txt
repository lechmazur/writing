<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; the "peculiar collector" feels more like a plot device than a fully realized individual with a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the pencil stub and world-altering potential is underdeveloped, straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting of the probability mapping center is intriguing, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the collector's motivation or the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story has a central idea of buried talents, but emotional impact is muted due to excessive telling over showing; symbolism of the pencil stub feels forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
