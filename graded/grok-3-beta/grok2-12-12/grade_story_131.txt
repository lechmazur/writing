<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness is present but underdeveloped; his transformation from detachment to courage feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the gravitational anomaly and stones' connection to courage feel forced and lack logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is intriguing but underutilized in enhancing atmosphere; sensory details like "softly audible" are mentioned but not vividly immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact with Eli's transformation, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing, and the symbolism of stones feels shallow and predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative leans on clich√©d themes of overcoming fear without fresh perspective; emotional descriptions are stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>While the story integrates assigned elements, it lacks cohesion and depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
