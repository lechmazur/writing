<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the sentinel's morose nature and emotional objectivity are stated but not deeply explored through actions or nuanced reactions, limiting insight into his motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between forging metal and returning home lacks sufficient grounding in logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is adequate but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than integral, and the style lacks the polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
