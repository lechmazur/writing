<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation around finding the "upside of loss" feels vague and lacks depth; Eli's personality is underdeveloped, with no distinct voice or nuanced reactions to drive the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the connection between decoding microfilm and the black hole's radiance is tenuous, and pacing is uneven within the word limit, rushing key emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting is evocative with "gritty whimsy," but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the thematic weight of loss and discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with sea glass, but emotional impact is shallow due to telling rather than showing; lacks subtext or a satisfying resolution, leaving the central conflict underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes of isolation and discovery without subversion; metaphors like "black hole of doubt" are clich√©d, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than earned through nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is functional but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
