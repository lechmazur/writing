<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elara's daring nature is stated rather than shown through nuanced actions, and her motivation feels somewhat generic despite the spark of defiance theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between cosmic echoes and prejudice confrontation are underdeveloped, leading to a lack of coherence in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted mirror maze setting creates an eerie atmosphere that supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the orchard cat/dying tree timeframe feels disconnected from the main action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the mirror reflections as a metaphor for self-confrontation, but emotional resonance is weakened by overt telling rather than showing, and dialogue feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes of haunted mazes and overcoming prejudice; metaphors like the "spark of defiance" are overused, and emotional handling lacks nuanced subtext, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks the polish or depth needed for a lingering impact.</comment>
