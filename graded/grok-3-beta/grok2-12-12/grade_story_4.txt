<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map sacred spaces is clear, but DJ Anubis lacks depth beyond the playful attribute; reactions to objects and visions feel surface-level with no distinct voice or nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed; the unraveling thread as a method lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance or subtext; while the ending is purposeful, there’s minimal conflict or theme beyond surface narrative, and the writing style doesn’t elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors are generic, emotions are stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a unique style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but they drive the narrative awkwardly; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
