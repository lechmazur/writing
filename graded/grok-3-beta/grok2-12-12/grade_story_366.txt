<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elara's telepathic ability is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to decode weather journals feels disconnected from her barista role and lacks depth in execution. Her personality lacks a distinct voice, and reactions to objects or methods feel superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a basic arc but feels incomplete within the word limit; the connection between coffee-serving and glacier research is tenuous. Pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions, and cause-effect links are weak, especially regarding her quest's progress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The transmission repair dock setting is unique but underutilized; sensory details are sparse and generic. The atmosphere at the cusp of seasons is barely evoked, missing opportunities to tie into the climate theme or enhance mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the execution relies on predictable patterns and lacks nuanced emotion or fresh imagery. The writing feels formulaic at times, with generic descriptors and little individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than integral. The style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a choice. It lacks a lingering impact or depth.</comment>
