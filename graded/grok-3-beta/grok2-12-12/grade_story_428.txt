<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the handshake and studying broken constellations lack clear causal links to Marcus's transformation, resulting in a disjointed narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative and supports the tone of daring caution, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on generic descriptors and stated emotions ("felt lighter") rather than nuanced showing; lacks originality, following a predictable redemption arc without fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but feels constructed around them rather than driven by organic narrative; lacks lingering depth or creative spark despite cohesive intent.</comment>
