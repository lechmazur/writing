<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; collecting stories as a method lacks logical grounding, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion, but feels constructed around them rather than organic; lacks lingering impact or creative depth despite the short length.</comment>
