<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to discover non-violence is clear but underdeveloped; the insomniac poet's personality feels somewhat generic, lacking a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance in reactions to whispers and confessions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between whispers and drunken confessions as a method to eliminate violence is tenuous and lacks logical depth, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of empty abundance, but sensory details are sparse, and the subway timeframe feels underutilized, missing opportunities to enhance atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through shared confessions, and symbolism of botanical samples is a strength, but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of non-violence feels stated rather than shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining whispers and confessions, but metaphors like "delicate waltz" are clich√©d, and emotional resonance feels surface-level, relying on explicit statements over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks depth, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
