<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "hidden promise" and "spark of defiance" are mentioned but not explored with nuance, leaving the swordsman feeling more like a concept than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels repetitive and predictable; the connection between following meteors and overcoming challenges is stated rather than shown, undermining coherence and impact within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is intriguing and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's potential to enhance the tone of "knowing naivety" is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; while the imagery of meteors is symbolic, it feels heavy-handed, and the narrative relies on telling rather than showing the swordsmanâ€™s inner conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive phrases like "spark of defiance"; metaphors are generic, and the narrative lacks a unique voice or surprising twist, suggesting a reliance on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but lacks depth and lingering impact; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than integral, and the style does little to elevate the narrative beyond surface-level engagement.</comment>
