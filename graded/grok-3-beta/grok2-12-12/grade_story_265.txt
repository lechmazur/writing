<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The impassive deputyâ€™s characterization lacks depth; his motivation to witness pure grace feels vague and disconnected from his established trait of impassivity, failing to reveal nuanced personality through actions or reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels forced in connecting the oil changes to the orchard visits; pacing is uneven, with the climax of the blossom opening rushed and lacking sufficient buildup within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of the lush orchard in an abandoned cathedral is evocative and supports the tone of cautious bravery, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between the setting and the timeframe of oil changes feels arbitrary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional impact with the moment of grace, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing; literary devices like the echoes of bees feel contrived, and the ending lacks a lasting resonance or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on predictable tropes of seeking beauty in a mundane world without subversion; metaphors like the secret language of bees are generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion among its many assigned elements, which feel awkwardly integrated; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
