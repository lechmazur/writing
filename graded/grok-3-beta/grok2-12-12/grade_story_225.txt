<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Elara's motivation is clear with her love for butterflies, but her personality lacks depth beyond this obsession; her duality as healer and infector feels underexplored and lacks nuance in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the butterflies' plea driving action, but the resolution feels rushed and the Morse code method lacks logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is evocative and supports the battered tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's unconventional love or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with nature's importance, but emotional impact is shallow due to telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of butterflies signaling in Morse code is unique, the execution relies on predictable steampunk tropes and generic descriptors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style lacks clarity at times, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it lacks a lingering impact or depth.</comment>
