<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to reflect lightning is clear, but the cyber-templar's personality lacks depth beyond generic determination and fear; "patiently frantic" feels superficially applied without nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the action of reflecting lightning driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the method's logic (prism redirecting lightning) strains believability even in a speculative context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sky burial site setting is evocative and ties to the tone of euphoric agitation, with strong visual imagery of storms and vultures, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the bridle and storm, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings like "awe and terror"; ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, lacking deeper subtext or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a cyber-templar is intriguing, the execution relies on predictable tropes of man versus nature without subversion; emotional descriptions are stated rather than shown, and metaphors like "collision course with reality" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from underdeveloped character and forced method; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
