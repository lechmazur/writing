<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams is clear, but Elias's amiable nature feels superficial and underexplored, lacking depth in action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the crossword-solving action drives the story, yet the resolution via sudden brilliant light is abrupt and lacks logical buildup within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room sets an eerie atmosphere that supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion with specific sights or sounds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the crossword and light, but emotional impact is weak; it tells rather than shows Elias's feelings, and the ending feels more convenient than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on predictable tropes of hidden knowledge in puzzles without subversion; metaphors like glowing letters are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
