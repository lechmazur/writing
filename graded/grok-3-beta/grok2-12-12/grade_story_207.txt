<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to break the oath is clear, but Elara's "meekly assertive" trait feels inconsistently portrayed and lacks depth in shaping her actions; her voice and personality remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but the connection between sifting gossip columns and breaking the oath is tenuous; pacing feels rushed at the climax, undermining coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with Elara's freedom, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; lacks subtext or memorable literary devices, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing leans on clich√©d phrases like "path to redemption" and generic emotional descriptors; lacks originality in perspective and shows formulaic patterns without subversion or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels forced around them rather than organic; lacks lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
