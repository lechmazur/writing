<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arrogance and doubt are present, but their interplay lacks depth; motivation feels surface-level and reactions to the tapestry are predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but rushed; the connection between beginning and end is weak, and the song as a method feels forced rather than organic to the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is evocative and supports the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the character’s internal struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance and symbolism with the tapestry and song, but the impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of self-doubt and redemption without fresh subversion; metaphors like “frost under the morning sun” feel generic and overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than integral; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
