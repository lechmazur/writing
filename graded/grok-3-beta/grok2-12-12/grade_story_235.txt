<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Hana's motivation to provoke unspoken conversation is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "dramatically subtle" attribute; Kaito's development feels surface-level and reactive rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with repositioning driving subtle progression, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between meteor showers and art are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Japanese castle setting enhances the tone of distant intimacy effectively, and sensory details like the meteor shower are evocative, though some connections between setting and action feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through subtext and symbolism of meteor showers, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central theme of intertwined fates lacks a sharper conflict to anchor it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "whisper across time" feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly unique stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the pressed flower book, but the style occasionally leans toward over-ornamentation, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
