<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to make amends is clear, but Elara's personality as a curious tinkerer feels underdeveloped; her actions lack depth beyond the surface goal, and her voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; the method of interconnected wishes lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality with the nano-scale setting, but leans on predictable reconciliation tropes without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels constructed around them rather than using them organically; lacks lingering depth or memorable impact.</comment>
