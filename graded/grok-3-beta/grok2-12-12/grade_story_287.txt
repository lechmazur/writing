<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors like "careful wildness"; lacks originality in metaphor and emotional nuance, relying on explicit statements over showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but lacks cohesion and depth; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
