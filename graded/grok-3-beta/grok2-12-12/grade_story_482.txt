<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in the setting and concept, but execution feels formulaic with predictable emotional beats; metaphors like the bullet hole "winking" are clichéd and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
