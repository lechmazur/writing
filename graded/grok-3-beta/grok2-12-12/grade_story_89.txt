<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the action and the method (buried time capsules) lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the variable star observation deck is intriguing and ties to the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of confusing certainty isnâ€™t consistently reflected in the world-building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic imagery (e.g., clouds parting as a sign); lacks originality in handling tropes like hidden capsules, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but lacks depth or lingering impact; style is clear but uninspired, and brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
