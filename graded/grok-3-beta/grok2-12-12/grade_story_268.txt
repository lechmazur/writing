<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to prevent war through mastering an ancient art is clear, but his personality as a subdued vigilante lacks depth and distinct voice; his actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tracking mirror distortions and understanding war feels tenuous and underdeveloped; pacing is uneven with repetitive focus on the mirror.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area enhances the tone of isolation and "screaming silence," but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the mirror and war theme feels superficial rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact with war's cost as a theme, but it heavily "tells" rather than "shows" through repetitive exposition; symbolism of the mirror and bead is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The concept of mirror distortions as war's lies is intriguing but not original; writing relies on generic descriptors like "screaming silence" and lacks nuanced emotion, feeling somewhat formulaic and predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style is overly repetitive and lacks clarity in purpose; it doesn't leave a lasting impression or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
