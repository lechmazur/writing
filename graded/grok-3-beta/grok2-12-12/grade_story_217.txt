<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Mara’s “underestimated rebel” trait and “sadly joyful” attribute are stated but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks depth; the arc feels predictable and rushed within the word limit, with the connection between beginning and end feeling forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is adequately conveyed with “ephemeral gloom,” but sensory details are sparse and generic, failing to fully immerse the reader in the haunted house setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; literary devices like symbolism are present but superficial, and the ending feels clichéd rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by reliance on predictable tropes (haunted house, rebel character) without subversion; writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and stated emotions rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than seamlessly integrated, and the story lacks a lingering depth or creative spark.</comment>
