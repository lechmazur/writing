<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to become a weaver of dreams is clear but lacks depth or nuance; the mechanical arm feels like a superficial trait rather than a defining aspect of personality or action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but repetitive, with an overemphasis on the sock's symbolism without a strong narrative arc or resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse setting is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by repetitive phrasing and generic descriptors like "shifting equilibria"; lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the story lacks a lingering impact or depth.</comment>
