<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's "silently talkative" trait is mentioned but not deeply explored or reflected in distinct actions or voice, and her motivation feels generic without nuanced personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; the VR headset action drives the story but feels contrived, and the resolution is abrupt, missing a satisfying middle-to-end progression within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the story lacks depth or lingering impact despite creative potential in the setting and concept.</comment>
