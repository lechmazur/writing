<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Serene's motivation to find wisdom is stated but lacks depth or personal stakes. Her reactions to objects and concepts feel generic, and her personality lacks a distinct voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc within the word limit. The action of unraveling drives the plot minimally, and pacing feels rushed at the end with an abrupt resolution.</comment>
