<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map abandoned railways is clear but underdeveloped; the woodsman's personality lacks depth beyond the "artfully messy" 2.0/10.0 grade, and the use of the hairbrush feels gimmicky rather than revealing of character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, with a clear arc, but the connection between the hairbrush, short-circuiting, and measuring echoes feels forced and lacks logical cause-effect progression, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is an intriguing setting with potential, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully support the tone of despairing cheer or enhance the action effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the theme of honesty, and the ending is somewhat satisfying, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable literary devices; it tells more than shows emotions and character traits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of the radio wave garden is original, the narrative relies on predictable tropes of a dying man reflecting on life, with generic descriptors and stated emotions rather than nuanced showing; metaphors like the echo are overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive in parts but struggles to integrate all elements naturally; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, and it lacks a lingering depth or question to ponder beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
