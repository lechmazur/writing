<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between beginning and end are present but lack emotional weight, and pacing struggles to balance introspection with action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and overused metaphors like "fleeting moments"; lacks originality in emotional portrayal and relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
