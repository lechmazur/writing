<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the discovery of the bone flute driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, lacking a strong resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The extinct language archive setting is intriguing but underdeveloped; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere fails to fully support the tone of "peaceful anger" or enhance the action meaningfully.</comment>
