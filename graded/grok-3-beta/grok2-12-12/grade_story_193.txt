<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (cure for loneliness) is clear but lacks depth; the prince's personality feels generic, with no distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the mortar and pestle beyond a vague "connection."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the snowstorm as a plot device is logical but not particularly inventive, and coherence is maintained with minor abruptness in emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned customs office is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere aligns with loneliness but lacks vividness to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with a predictable theme of connection over solitude; symbolism of the key and mortar is present but heavy-handed, and the ending feels tidy but not particularly memorable or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes of exiled royalty and sudden encounters without subversion; writing is clear but lacks a unique style or fresh metaphors, feeling somewhat formulaic with stated emotions rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but lacks a lingering impact or depth; style is functional but not striking, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
