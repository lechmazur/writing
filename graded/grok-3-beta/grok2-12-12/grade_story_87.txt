<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the "patient librarian" and "hyperactively serene" traits are mentioned but not deeply explored or integrated into actions beyond surface description. Motivation to bury hatred is clear but lacks depth or specificity in backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between peeling stickers and burying hatred is underdeveloped, lacking emotional weight or logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly described with brass gears and steam-powered chandeliers, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are limited, and the setting’s connection to the character’s motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact; it relies on telling rather than showing emotions through action or subtext. Imagery like "savage grace" is intriguing but overused without fresh context, and the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from repetitive phrasing ("throb," "savage grace") and generic emotional descriptors, suggesting formulaic writing. The concept of healing via stickers feels forced and lacks a unique perspective or nuanced emotional handling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic to the narrative. Style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
