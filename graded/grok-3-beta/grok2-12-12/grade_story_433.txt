<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between internal struggle and external action is somewhat forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative relies on predictable emotional beats and generic descriptors like "broken heart," lacking fresh imagery or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style is unremarkable, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength; it lacks lingering impact.</comment>
