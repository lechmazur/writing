<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to fight stagnation is clear, but the "calm doomsayer" lacks depth or distinct voice; their placid ferocity feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of resuming a mission lacks specificity, and pacing feels rushed with little build-up to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop and sunrise barn loft create an intriguing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the loss of innocence feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with loss of innocence, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending lacks punch, and conflict with gods of stagnation remains abstract and unresolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable steampunk tropes without subversion; metaphors like "gears of progress" are clich√©d, and emotional resonance is surface-level with stated rather than nuanced feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but feels forced around them rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or creative spark to elevate it beyond a basic narrative.</comment>
