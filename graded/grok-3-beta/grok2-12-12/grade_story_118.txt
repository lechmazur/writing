<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the hive-mind therapist's peculiarity feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping actions or motivations. Agents are generic with minimal distinct voice or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the concept of hindsight drives the narrative but lacks a strong causal link between beginning and end. Pacing feels rushed within the word limit, with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is moderately evocative with the night air and secret facility, but sensory details are sparse and generic, failing to fully immerse. Setting and tone connection to concept feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or lasting impact; symbolism of wax and hindsight is intriguing but underdeveloped. Ending feels predictable, and conflict resolution is weak within the word constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from clich√©d metaphors (e.g., "slow drip of candle wax") and predictable secret agent tropes. Writing lacks nuanced emotion, relying on stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. Style is functional but uninspired, with little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
