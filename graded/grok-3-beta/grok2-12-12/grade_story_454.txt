<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Raven's "rationally emotional" trait feels stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior, and her motivation for acceptance lacks depth or backstory to make it compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a strong arc; the meeting with the outsider group resolves too quickly without building tension, and pacing feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
