<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eli's softhearted nature is mentioned repeatedly but lacks depth or nuance in portrayal; motivation to restore storytelling feels surface-level and lacks personal stakes or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with midnight visits driving action, but pacing feels repetitive and rushed at times; the connection between beginning and end is weak due to lack of escalating tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and planetarium contrast effectively, and some sensory details (cool air, star charts) enhance mood, but the atmosphere lacks consistent depth and fails to fully support the unraveling fate concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact but over-relies on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the belt buckle and stars feels forced, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases like "muted euphoria" and "consistently organic" feel formulaic; the narrative lacks originality, leaning on predictable cyberpunk tropes without subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements but feels more constructed around them than cohesive; it lacks a lingering impact or creative spark, with style hindering clarity through redundancy.</comment>
