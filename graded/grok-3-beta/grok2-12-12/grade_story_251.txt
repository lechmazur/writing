<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to the cosmic scoreboard feels vague and lacks depth; the "happily sad" attribute is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, resulting in a shallow portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but the connection between puzzle edges and defragmenting the cosmic scoreboard is tenuous and lacks logical grounding, making the resolution feel forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is intriguing and somewhat enhances the isolation of the prophet’s task, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully support the story’s cosmic stakes or emotional tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance due to overt telling of emotions ("happily sad") rather than showing; symbolism of marbles and puzzle edges feels heavy-handed and lacks deeper subtext or thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by generic descriptors and predictable cosmic reset tropes; metaphors like "cosmic scoreboard" feel overused, and emotional handling lacks nuance, suggesting formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite incorporating assigned elements; the story feels built around them rather than using them in service of a compelling narrative, with style and clarity hindered by abstract concepts lacking grounding.</comment>
