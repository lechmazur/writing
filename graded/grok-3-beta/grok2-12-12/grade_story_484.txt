<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to embody values through brewing is intriguing but underdeveloped; the "groggy brewer" trait feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the ritual as a turning point, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between darkness and transformation are vague and unconvincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Haunted mansion graveyard setting enhances the dark tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere's connection to the brewer's motivation feels forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable gothic tropes without subversion; metaphors like "encroaching darkness" are generic, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering impact or evidence of truly creative synthesis.</comment>
