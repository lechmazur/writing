<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation for reconciliation is clear, but Alex's personality as a wilderness guide feels underdeveloped and irrelevant to the narrative; lacks distinct voice or depth in reaction to the ring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with rushed introspection, and the connection between action (equalizing) and resolution lacks logical depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sunken pirate ship ballroom is evocative and ties to the theme of salvageable relationships, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance through reconciliation but relies on telling over showing; symbolism of the ring is heavy-handed, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality with the encoded blanket method, but leans on clich√©d themes of family healing; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, and metaphors like the ship feel overused and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or creative spark, and the style is functional but uninspired.</comment>
