<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as a pleasant meddler with an openly manipulative streak is intriguing, but his motivation to decode ancient symbols feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional depth, making his actions seem more mechanical than humanly driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's focus on weakening a rival through digital footprints is conceptually interesting but lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital ward setting create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the hum of machines, but the connection between setting and the rusted skates or core action feels forced and underexplored.</comment>
