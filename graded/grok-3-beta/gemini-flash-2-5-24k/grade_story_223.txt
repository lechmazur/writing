<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a deep longing to confront the mirror, tied to seasickness as a metaphor for instability, but the awkwardly charming trait feels underdeveloped and incidental to the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with transformation driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the moon-phase method, while logical, lacks deeper integration into the conflict's resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon create a vivid, ethereal atmosphere that enhances the tone of nostalgic defiance, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of resolution and uses symbolism (mirror, bulb) effectively, but lacks emotional depth in showing over telling, and the ending, while purposeful, doesn't fully resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of transformation and moon phases offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar fantasy tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface, feeling constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
