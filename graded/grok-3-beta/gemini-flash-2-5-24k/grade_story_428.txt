<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to banish doubt is clear, but the transition from city planner to doomsday prepper lacks depth; the "rarely authentic" trait feels underexplored in shaping personality beyond a surface shield.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of debasing drives the story, but the handshake timing feels disconnected and the pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ancient Indian temple is evocative with sensory details like dust and incense, but its connection to the character’s motivation and the timeframe of the handshake feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Symbolism of the ink blotter and broken constellations adds depth, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of internal shifts; ending lacks a strong punch despite a discernible theme of embracing unpredictability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "cracking chains" feel clichéd; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative tone shifts slightly, lacking consistent individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
