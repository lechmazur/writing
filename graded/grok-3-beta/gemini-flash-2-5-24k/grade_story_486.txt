<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to hush the crowd is clear, and his role as a sound engineer manipulating reality aligns with his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "clumsily dexterous" trait, which feels superficially applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning in the cauldron room and an implied resolution in the square, but the pantomime method feels underdeveloped as a driver of change, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room is evocative and supports the tone of practical illusion, with some sensory detail like "simmering pots," but the connection to the stained glass fragment feels forced, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elias's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on collective guilt and silence as power, with decent use of symbolism (stained glass as frequency refractor), but the emotional impact is muted, and the writing often tells rather than shows, lacking a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of silent retribution via pantomime is somewhat original, the execution relies on generic descriptors like "unstoppable roar," and the tone shifts slightly with overly ornate phrases, diminishing authenticity and suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, leaving limited lingering impact.</comment>
