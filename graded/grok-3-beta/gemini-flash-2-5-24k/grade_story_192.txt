<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear, but the "eager lookout" lacks depth or distinct voice; their actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between poltergeist activity and the broader theme of digital isolation remains underdeveloped and somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient Roman villa reimagined as a setting is intriguing and ties to the atmosphere of mystery, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of ruthless kindness feels inconsistently applied to the setting's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with the theme of connection, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; emotional impact is muted, and the ending lacks a satisfying resolution or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept of a technically organic poltergeist is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable supernatural tropes without subversion; writing style lacks distinctiveness and occasionally feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice; lacks a strong lingering thought or creative spark to elevate it beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
