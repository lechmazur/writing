<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between theorizing and tangible progress is vague, weakening cause-and-effect coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms create a chilling atmosphere that supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara's defiance, and symbolism of the "foundation" adds subtext, but the ending feels abrupt, and the conflict lacks sharp resolution or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows potential for originality, the execution relies on familiar haunted passage tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions lean toward stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
