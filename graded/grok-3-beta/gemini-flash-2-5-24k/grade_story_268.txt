<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to master an ancient art is clear, but the subdued vigilante's personality lacks depth or distinct voice; their actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with thematic depth, but brevity seems to limit development rather than enhance it; lingering impact is present but not striking.</comment>
