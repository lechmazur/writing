<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Silas's loneliness as a ringleader is stated but not deeply explored; his motivation to guard the artifact feels surface-level and lacks emotional depth or personal stakes beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the action (outmaneuvering) and the resolution feels somewhat contrived; pacing is uneven with rushed exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ghost story recording booth setting is intriguing and complements the tone of playful dread, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact despite creative potential.</comment>
