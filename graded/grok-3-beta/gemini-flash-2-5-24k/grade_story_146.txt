<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s duality as a faux fortune teller with real visions is intriguing and shapes her motivation, but her peaceful anger feels underexplored and lacks depth in influencing her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the exploration driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and connections between vision and action are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vividly described with sensory details like aged paper and dust, enhancing the mood, though the planting season timeframe feels like a superficial addition rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has symbolic depth with the bone flute as a key to the past, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a faux seer with real visions offers originality, some descriptions (e.g., “quiet fire”) feel clichéd, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the flute and archive, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
