<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to master time is clear, but the "polite bandit" persona lacks depth or distinct voice; actions align with motivation but feel surface-level without nuanced personality development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the method of using a harp feels contrived and disrupts logical flow; pacing is uneven with rushed buildup to the temporal manipulation concept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the electronic wilderness refuge is evocative with sensory details like ozone and decaying circuits, but the classroom hush metaphor feels forced and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining tech and music for time manipulation, but metaphors like "classroom hush" are generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
