<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's cynicism and humble arrogance are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to harness the ephemeral feels abstract and lacks emotional grounding, limiting depth in her reactions and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of awakening drives the story but lacks a clear resolution, and pacing feels rushed toward the end with insufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse library setting and eerie nostalgia tone are evocative and well-paired, with strong sensory details like salt and dust, though the connection between setting and action feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a faint emotional response through isolation and loss, with decent imagery, but lacks a satisfying ending or clear conflict resolution; subtext is present but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the style lacks distinct individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels limiting, and the impact is muted despite creative potential.</comment>
