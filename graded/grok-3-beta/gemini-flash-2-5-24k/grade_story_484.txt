<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation as a brewer embodying values through fermentation is intriguing but underdeveloped; the "uniquely generic" trait feels forced and lacks depth in shaping personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "initiate" feels vague and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the haunted mansion graveyard is evocative and supports the tone of encroaching darkness, with decent sensory details; however, the timeframe of the protest lull feels disconnected and underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing relies on generic descriptors and predictable tropes of darkness and haunted settings without subversion; metaphors like "world going sour" are clich√©d, lacking fresh perspective or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice; lacks lingering depth or impact.</comment>
