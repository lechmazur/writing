<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's obsession for forbidden data, but his personality lacks depth beyond this singular drive; the "enthusiastic apathy" feels inconsistently portrayed and his voice is not distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while the action of gorging on data drives the narrative, the story feels static and incomplete, with pacing that drags on description over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly described with sensory details like salt, dust, and cracked mud, enhancing the desolate mood, but the connection between the lavender bundle and setting feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue through the concept of forbidden knowledge, with strong imagery like "newborn galaxy," but lacks emotional depth, a satisfying ending, and nuanced conflict; it tells more than shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of digital scavenging is somewhat original, metaphors like "dying ember" and "newborn galaxy" feel overused; emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts slightly, lacking unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but feels built around them rather than using them organically; style is clear but not striking, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
