<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The universal translation center and bird calls create an intriguing backdrop, and sensory details like bird calls are evocative, but the setting's potential to enhance the emotional theme is underexplored, leaving the atmosphere somewhat thin.</comment>
