<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to collect lost lullabies is clear, but the gloomy orchardist's personality lacks depth beyond surface melancholy; actions align with motivation but lack nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overemphasis on setup; logical flow is present but not compelling, with the action of containment feeling repetitive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the resonance testing facility is evocative and supports the concept, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere of haggard awe complements tone, though inconsistently immersive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Original concept of artificial lullabies shows promise, but execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors; metaphors like "secret garden" feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
