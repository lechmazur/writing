<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's ambition and loyalty to dying dialects are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this singular obsession; his reactions and voice feel somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of deciphering bruises feels overly abstract and disconnected from a satisfying resolution; pacing is uneven with too much focus on process over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, cold atmosphere that supports the tone of peculiar faith, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the poster-deciphering method feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on loss and preservation, with decent use of metaphor (e.g., linguistic trails), but lacks emotional resonance or a strong central conflict; the ending feels repetitive rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of lost paths and dialects is unique, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors of cold and isolation; metaphors like "breath in cold air" feel overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style is occasionally overwrought, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it leaves a faint impression but lacks lasting depth.</comment>
