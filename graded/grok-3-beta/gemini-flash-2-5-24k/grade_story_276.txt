<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the uneasy emissary's anxiety and hope are stated but not deeply explored through actions or unique voice, resulting in a lack of emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while thematic connections exist, the narrative feels more like a meditation than a story with momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in linking cosmic debris to personal redemption, the execution feels somewhat formulaic with generic metaphors and stated emotions lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the style prioritizes abstraction over clarity, limiting its publishability.</comment>
