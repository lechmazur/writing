<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's hesitance and awkwardness are present but underdeveloped; motivation to restore traditional systems feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the method (hermit crab transitions) feels forced and lacks clear causality with the action of emerging, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the tundra orchard with geothermal vents is evocative and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection to the blank postcard feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional depth or strong subtext; imagery (hermit crabs, vents) is intriguing but not fully leveraged for impact; ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like hermit crabs and geothermal vents, but metaphors are generic, and emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but style lacks clarity and depth; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
