<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's longing for peace with the past, but the "shaky mercenary" trait feels underexplored beyond physical trembling; deeper psychological nuance is missing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the search for the unknown drives the story, yet the resolution lacks impact due to vague stakes and rushed pacing at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the collapsed cathedral turned artist’s haven is vivid and complements the tone of longing; sensory details like spray paint and incense are effective, though connection to the amber feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through Elias’s quest, with some imagery like "grave dust" standing out, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in setting and tone, but relies on predictable tropes of a haunted past without subversion; metaphors like "threads of regret" feel generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constrained by length rather than deliberate; lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative despite creative setting.</comment>
