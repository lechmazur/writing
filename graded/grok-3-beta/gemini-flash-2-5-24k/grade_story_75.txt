<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear, but the guarded nature of the minstrel feels underdeveloped; their personality lacks depth beyond the assigned trait, and their voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the action of disowning drives the story, but the method (decrypting vows) lacks logical grounding, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Nano-forest setting is evocative and ties to the timeframe, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere of angry peace supports the tone, though inconsistently applied to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the decryption process, but symbolism (bookmark, vows) feels heavy-handed; ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic emotional descriptors and predictable resolution; metaphors like "angry peace" are intriguing but not fully explored, and the narrative lacks nuanced human emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
