<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's portrayal as an unruly alchemist is intriguing, but his motivation to disarm cynicism feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; his actions align with the trait, yet his voice and inner conflict remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of impressing driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station setting is evocative and complements the concept of the touched sky; sensory details like stale coffee and ozone enhance immersion, though the timeframe "between innings" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild wonder through imagery and subtext about the touched sky, but the emotional impact is restrained; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and the theme of wonder versus cynicism needs sharper focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of the touched sky offers originality, some descriptions (e.g., "hauntingly cheerful") feel slightly forced; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about wonder, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
