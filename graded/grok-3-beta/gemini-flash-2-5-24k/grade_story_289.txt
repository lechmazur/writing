<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Anya's brainy observer trait shapes her precise, analytical approach, and her motivation to find lost civilizations is clear, but her emotional connection to the doll feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in revealing her inner conflict beyond surface sentiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc feels incomplete within the word limit; while the action of enforcing her presence through art drives the story, the resolution lacks impact, and pacing feels rushed toward the end with insufficient buildup to her realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay and futuristic timeframe are vividly paired, enhancing the ethereal mood, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual glow, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through other senses like sound or touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Anya's vulnerability, with effective symbolism in the doll and art, but the lack of central conflict or tension within the tight word limit diminishes overall impact and memorability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic graffiti is original, the narrative leans on predictable themes of loss and rediscovery without subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced subtext or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and the lingering thought is present but not profound.</comment>
