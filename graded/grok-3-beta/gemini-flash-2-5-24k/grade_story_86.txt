<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's apprehension is noted but not deeply explored; his archer identity feels superficial as it doesn't significantly shape his actions beyond a vague instinctual response. Motivation is clear but lacks nuance or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the sudden guard confrontation. Cause and effect are logical, yet the story lacks depth in connecting the action to a broader resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center is vividly described and complements the tone of borrowed dawn, but sensory details are sparse beyond the humming air and cold metal, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with the weight of truth, but it leans on telling rather than showing. Symbolism of the candle and crystal is present but not fully developed; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the cyberpunk setting offers some originality, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of hidden truth and digital deceit without subversion. Metaphors like "reignite a flame with damp kindling" feel generic; emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral. Style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; the brief length feels like a limitation, not a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
