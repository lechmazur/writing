<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the woodsman’s quest to map railways masking a deeper personal loss, and the hairbrush effectively reveals his emotional tether; however, his personality lacks distinctiveness, and the "artfully messy" attribute feels superficially applied without deeper integration into his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from mapping to personal revelation is coherent within the word limit, with the short-circuit action driving a pivotal moment, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the emotional climax, and the connection between the method and the broader narrative feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is intriguing but underutilized, with insufficient sensory detail to ground the atmosphere; the tone of despairing cheer contrasts well with the concept, but the setting’s connection to the hairbrush and motivation feels forced and lacks depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the woodsman’s realization and has strong subtext with the hairbrush as a symbol of loss, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the writing occasionally tells rather than shows emotion, diminishing impact; the theme of honesty is clear but not profoundly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a personal angle on grief, some metaphors (e.g., mapping the heart) feel overused, and emotional handling occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings; the style is individual but not strikingly original, with minor tonal shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style lacks the polish for top-tier clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling of grief, though creative integration of elements is competent rather than exceptional.</comment>
