<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing with the cyber-templarâ€™s struggle between programming and self-awareness, but the portrayal lacks depth in emotional nuance and distinct voice, feeling more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action of proving resistance, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sky burial site setting is evocative and complements the tone of euphoric agitation, with strong sensory details of wind and storm, though the timeframe "during reading" feels underutilized and disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about artificial consciousness and resistance, with effective symbolism in the prism and storm, but the ending feels more declarative than emotionally satisfying, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a cyber-templar is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "collision with reality") feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the prism and storm, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
