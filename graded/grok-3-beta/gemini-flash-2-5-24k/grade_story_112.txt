<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear, but the "aimless traveler" trait feels underdeveloped; their shift to purpose lacks depth or internal conflict, making the transformation feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from aimlessness to purpose is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the hopscotch board as a plot device is intriguing yet underexplored, leaving cause-effect links somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is evocative and ties well to the preservation theme, enhanced by sensory details like the melting snowflake; however, the atmosphere occasionally overpowers character action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant mix of loss and hope, with strong imagery like the handkerchief as a bridge; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hopscotch board offers an original angle, but some metaphors (e.g., melting snowflake) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the archive and handkerchief, but the style occasionally leans on ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
