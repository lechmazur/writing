<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to archive sacred knowledge is clear, but their personality as a desert wanderer feels underdeveloped and disconnected from their actions in a space setting; lacks a distinct voice or deeper personal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but lacks a strong arc or resolution; the action of research drives the narrative, yet feels static and lacks escalating tension or a satisfying conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting of the space pirate ship crow's nest is evocative and ties to the mood of curiosity, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of the "last apple" feels underexplored and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story has a thoughtful concept of translated love, with some subtext, but emotional impact is muted due to over-reliance on telling rather than showing; ending feels purposeful but not particularly memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of translated love is somewhat original, the execution relies on generic descriptors and lacks fresh metaphors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but feels more built around them than driven by organic narrative; lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface ideas despite creative intent.</comment>
