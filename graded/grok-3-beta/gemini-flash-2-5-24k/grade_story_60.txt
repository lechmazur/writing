<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's indifference is portrayed consistently, but lacks depth or nuance; motivation to seal a covenant feels stated rather than felt, with little insight into personal stakes or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overly descriptive passages slowing momentum; connection between ritual and outcome lacks clarity in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details like luminescent moss and cold air enhancing the mystic tone; setting effectively supports the action, though timeframe integration feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has some emotional resonance and symbolic depth with the faded ribbon, but impact is muted by lack of clear conflict or tension; writing style is competent but not distinctive enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in the ritual's simplicity, but metaphors like "time seemed to pool" feel familiar; emotional portrayal leans toward telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but feels more built around them than driven by organic narrative; length feels restrictive rather than deliberate, with lingering impact diminished by surface-level exploration.</comment>
