<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development of Elias as a bluffing swindler is moderately effective, with clear motivation for survival and a deeper need to reveal truth, but his "energetically lethargic" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed and lacks depth in shaping his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure shows potential with a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the restarting computer and the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of a reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is vividly imagined and enhances the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of the computer restart feels tacked on rather than integral to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with subtext about unspoken truths, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict lacks sharpness; emotional resonance is present but not fully "shown" through action or detail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors like "magnetic pull" and predictable character dynamics; while the setting is unique, the narrative lacks fresh metaphors and nuanced emotional handling, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; creative thinking is evident in the setting, yet the style and depth fall short of leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
