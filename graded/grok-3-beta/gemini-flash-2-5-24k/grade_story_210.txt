<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Alistair Finch's amiable nature is implied but not deeply explored or shown through actions; his motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams is clear but lacks emotional depth or personal stakes, feeling more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; while the concept of navigating shadows is present, the story feels more like a vignette than a complete narrative, with pacing that meanders without clear progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is evocatively described and supports the tone of mystery, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through sound or touch related to the sea or timbers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story has potential for emotional resonance and subtext through the theme of memory and resilience, but it leans too heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending feels contemplative but not fully satisfying or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of listening to ship timbers is unique, the execution feels somewhat formulaic with predictable "haunted" tropes; metaphors like "air growing heavy" are generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but it feels more like a sketch than a polished piece; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice or lingering impact, falling short of top-tier literary standards.</comment>
