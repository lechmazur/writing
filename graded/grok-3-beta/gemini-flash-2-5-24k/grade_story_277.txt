<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of unmasking feels more conceptual than concrete, leading to a lack of tangible progression or resolution; pacing is uneven with overly dense exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The giant's workshop and golden age timeframe create a compelling backdrop of decay, and the tone of fractured beauty enhances the mood, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
