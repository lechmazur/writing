<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's sassiness and academic mischief are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to spark madness feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the fracturing of reality, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reality calibration office and twilight setting create a compelling sterile-to-chaotic atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the hum and uncalibrated laughter, though connections to the object could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining elements, some metaphors (digital seabed) feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
