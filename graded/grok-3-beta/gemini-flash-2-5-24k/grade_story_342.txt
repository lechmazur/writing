<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining psychic archaeology with postcards, but metaphors like "parasitic script" feel generic; tone shifts slightly, and emotional resonance lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in blending elements, but cohesion suffers from unclear motivation and rushed pacing; it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond surface narrative.</comment>
