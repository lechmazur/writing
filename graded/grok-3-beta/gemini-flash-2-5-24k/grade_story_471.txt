<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map ghost towns is clear and ties to personal loss, but the "meticulously careless" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes actions beyond surface recklessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves a sense of resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed introspection at the end; cause and effect between promise and decision-making lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned funfair in a misty forest is evocatively described with strong sensory detail, enhancing the melancholic tone, though connection to the vintage lens feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through themes of grief and avoidance, with effective symbolism of the lens, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending feels purposeful yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s and shows some individual style, but metaphors like "mist clinging like a shroud" are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length works, though depth is limited by predictable resolution.</comment>
