<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "loudly introverted" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to reunite with courage feels clear but lacks depth in execution, with reactions to the CD being more symbolic than revealing of personal nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; meandering as an action drives the story but lacks urgency, and pacing feels uneven with a rushed internal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Neon cathedral setting is evocative and complements the tone of crooked hope, but sensory details are sparse, and the fog/fireflies feel more decorative than integral to atmosphere or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of internal courage, with decent use of symbolism (CD, fireflies), but lacks a strong central conflict and deeper subtext; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While imagery like fireflies shows originality, the narrative leans on predictable post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
