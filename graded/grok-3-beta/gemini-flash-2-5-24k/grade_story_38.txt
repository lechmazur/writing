<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to discover non-violence is clear but lacks depth in personal stakes; the insomniac poet's personality feels underdeveloped beyond obsessive traits, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to their environment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit but lacks a strong arc or resolution; the action of eliminating violence conditions feels more conceptual than actionable, leading to a sense of incompleteness despite logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like dust motes and train rumbles, but the setting's connection to the poet's motivation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on non-violence through symbolism like botanical samples, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is original, execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable patterns of obsession; metaphors like plant taxonomy are fresh but not fully nuanced, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements but feels built around them rather than using them organically; style is clear but lacks distinct flair, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, missing a lingering impact.</comment>
