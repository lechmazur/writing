<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's naivety and gambling nature are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to capture a last spark feels vague and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the candle mold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the action on the dock feels more symbolic than purposeful, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on internal reflection over narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative and ties to the tone of oblivion, with sensory details like salty air and waves enhancing mood, but the candlelit dinner timeframe feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism with the candle, but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of defiance against oblivion feels more stated than shown through subtext or action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of unspoken bargains offers some originality, the execution relies on predictable existential musings; metaphors like the candle as defiance are somewhat generic, and emotional resonance feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or truly creative synthesis of ideas.</comment>
