<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The action of elongating a digital echo drives the plot, but the method feels contrived within the tight word limit; pacing is uneven, with a rushed resolution that lacks a strong arc despite a clear beginning and end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is intriguing and supports the concept, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of jubilant remorse feels inconsistently applied; the paint mixing timeframe adds little to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of legacy, but literary devices like the measuring tape as metaphor feel forced; the ending is purposeful yet lacks depth or lasting impact.</comment>
