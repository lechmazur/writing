<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to rewrite destiny is clear and tied to agoraphobia, but the portrayal lacks depth; reactions and voice feel somewhat generic, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a logical method (rain rhythm), but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks full closure within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but reliance on familiar magical-pact tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and metaphors lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style lacks distinctiveness; brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
