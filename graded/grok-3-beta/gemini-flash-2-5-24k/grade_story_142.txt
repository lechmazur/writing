<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to restore his fortune through secret recipes is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "broke aristocrat" trope; his actions align with desperation, yet his internal transformation feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between walking and unlocking secrets feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative with strong sensory details like decay and cotton candy, enhancing the tone of blurry vividness; however, the integration with the timeframe "between parallel paths" feels vague and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the legacy's burden, with some effective imagery (mandrake pulsing), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending; conflict resolution feels too convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of harmonizing with a haunted space is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable supernatural tropes without subversion; sensory details are occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinction, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
