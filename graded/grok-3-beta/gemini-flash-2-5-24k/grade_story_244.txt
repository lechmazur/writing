<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt as a swordswoman is mentioned but not deeply explored; her motivation for atonement feels surface-level and lacks specific, revealing actions or memories to anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pursuit of the door feels rushed and lacks clear cause-effect progression; the ending hints at resolution without delivering a satisfying payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop setting is evocative with sensory details like flickering glass and electric hum, but its connection to the tribal mask and door concept feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of guilt and atonement but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending lacks emotional punch, and the central tension feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a guilty swordswoman seeking release is intriguing, the execution leans on predictable tropes of redemption quests; sensory details are generic at times, and emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
