<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of hydrolyzing power structures feels abstract and lacks concrete progression or resolution, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds create a vivid atmosphere and complement the tone of peaceful anger, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to charity drives feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style feels overly ornate at times, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
