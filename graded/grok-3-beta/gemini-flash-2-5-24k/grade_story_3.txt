<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas's surliness is present but underdeveloped as a defining trait; his motivation to understand cosmic patterns is clear but feels somewhat detached from his personality, lacking deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while the concept of market wisdom shapes the narrative, the progression feels more like a meditation than a story with distinct beginning, middle, and end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of market wisdom applied to the cosmos is original, but the execution relies on somewhat repetitive metaphors and lacks nuanced emotional depth, occasionally feeling overly conceptual and detached.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with its elements, but the style leans toward the ornate, occasionally hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, yet the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
