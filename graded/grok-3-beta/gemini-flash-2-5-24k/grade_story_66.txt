<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to find belonging in "nowhere" is intriguing but underdeveloped; the quiet deserter lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reactions, making actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of carbonizing masks drives a thematic point but doesn't build narrative momentum, leaving the story feeling static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the plant communication study is evocative and ties to the theme of silent observation, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story prompts reflection on belonging and cycles through strong symbolism (masks, mirrors), but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of reconstructing masks is original, the narrative leans on predictable metaphors (shattered masks as broken selves) without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story shows creative integration of elements like masks and carbonizing, but cohesion suffers from an unclear arc; it leaves a lingering thought on belonging, yet style feels overly abstract at times.</comment>
