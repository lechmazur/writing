<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to topple the idol is clear, but the astronomer's personality feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice; their detachment is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the goal of toppling the idol, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and the connection between cultivating algorithms and the idol's destruction lacks clarity in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse orchard and ice floes is evocative and complements the cold, emotionless tone; sensory details like crystal shadows are strong, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story prompts thought on emotion versus logic, with some effective symbolism (veil, idol), but lacks emotional resonance due to over-reliance on telling rather than showing; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a post-emotional world is intriguing, the writing leans on generic descriptors and overly logical character reasoning, lacking human nuance; metaphors like "coaxing life from stone" feel somewhat clich√©d.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often feels forced around them; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is minimal due to emotional detachment.</comment>
