<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's reclusive nature as a board game designer is adequately portrayed, and his motivation to shadowbox personal demons is clear, but his internal shift toward seeking belonging feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten clock tower setting is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, with some effective sensory details like dust motes and grinding gears, but the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the metaphysical nature of the ticket.</comment>
