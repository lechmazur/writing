<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist is intriguing, with a unique collective voice and clear motivation to anchor regrets, but their personality lacks depth beyond the gimmick; their reactions and dialogue, while distinct, feel more performative than revealing of inner conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the draining of regrets driving a clear progression, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on description while the resolution feels abrupt; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret agent training facility and nighttime setting effectively build a tense, peculiar atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like ozone and wax drips; however, the connection between setting and object (phone charger plug) feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue through its unusual concept and symbolism of waxen regrets, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level character exploration; dialogue is purposeful yet lacks natural flow; the ending feels more curious than satisfying, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its hive-mind therapist and regret-draining ritual, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., "ghosts of tomorrow") feel generic; emotional handling shows nuance in action over stated feelings, though the tone occasionally shifts unevenly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering oddity, though not a profound thought or feeling.</comment>
