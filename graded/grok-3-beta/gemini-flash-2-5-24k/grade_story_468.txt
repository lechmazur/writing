<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the search for journals, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links between discoveries are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like "loudly serene" chorus; the timeframe complements the mystical tone effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining elements like dream journals and singing spirits, but some phrases ("rustle of revelation") feel overwrought, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and depth beyond the narrative surface is only partially realized.</comment>
