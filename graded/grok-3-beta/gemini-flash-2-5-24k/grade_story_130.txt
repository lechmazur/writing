<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of seeking self-acceptance is clear and drives the narrative, but the "lost apprentice" lacks depth or distinct voice; their internal struggle feels somewhat generic despite the unique setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a sense of progression toward self-discovery, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between reverse-engineering static and personal growth is conceptually interesting yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship setting is vividly imagined with sensory details like "fragrant corridors," enhancing the atmosphere of displacement; however, the integration of setting with character motivation could be more seamless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on self-acceptance through symbolism of the nest and static confessions, but emotional impact is muted by overly explicit internal monologues rather than showing through action; ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of reverse-engineering static for wisdom is original, the narrative leans on predictable self-discovery tropes without subversion; metaphors like the nest are fresh but not consistently nuanced, and emotional expression occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, introspective piece.</comment>
