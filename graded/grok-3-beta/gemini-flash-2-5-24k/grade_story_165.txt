<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of reversed messages is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable fantasy tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions occasionally feel stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
