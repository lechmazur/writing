<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's obnoxiously polite attribute shapes her interactions uniquely, but her motivation feels underdeveloped beyond the assigned task; her reactions lack deeper personal stakes or internal conflict, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action of hindering, but pacing feels uneven with overemphasis on setup; cause and effect are logical, though the resolution lacks punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and laundry cycle timeframe create a striking, surreal contrast, enhanced by sensory details like the hum and slosh; atmosphere supports the playful dread, though setting-object connection feels tenuous.</comment>
