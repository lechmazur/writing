<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with stage fright shaping Elias's internal conflict, but the portrayal lacks depth; reactions to objects and actions feel symbolic rather than personal, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of submerging feels forced as a resolution, and pacing is uneven with abrupt shifts from introspection to action, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative and complements the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels underdeveloped despite potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with the inheritance of lies, and the ending has purpose, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; symbolism is present but heavy-handed, lacking subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining elements, the execution relies on predictable metaphors (e.g., "cosmic graveyard") and lacks nuanced emotion, with some repetitive phrasing ("never usual") breaking flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overworked symbolism; it shows creative intent but lacks the depth or lingering impact needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
