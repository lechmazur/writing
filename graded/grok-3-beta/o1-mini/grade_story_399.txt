<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eldric's grumpiness is noted but lacks depth or distinct voice; his motivation to heal trauma feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of jiggling the tube feels disconnected from meaningful progression; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room is evocative and supports the mystical tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to trauma feels superficial rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Symbolism of the sand mandala and tube is present but heavy-handed; emotional impact is undermined by telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The story leans on predictable trauma-healing tropes without subversion; language is overly ornate with generic descriptors, lacking originality or nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by forced integration of elements; style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and the story lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
