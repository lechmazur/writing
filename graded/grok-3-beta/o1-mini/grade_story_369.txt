<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Martin's optimistically bitter nature is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or distinct voice, and his motivation for spiritual development feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; while the mysterious packages drive the narrative, the resolution feels repetitive and incomplete, with pacing hindered by redundant descriptions within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is evocative and complements the tone of mystery, with some sensory details enhancing atmosphere, but the connection between setting and character motivation remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; while there is some symbolism with the string, the narrative relies heavily on telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "weight of secrets") and generic descriptors; the story feels formulaic, lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional resonance, with a predictable structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than integral, and the style lacks clarity or depth, failing to leave a lasting impression or lingering thought.</comment>
