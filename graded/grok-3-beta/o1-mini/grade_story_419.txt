<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's empathic nature and blacksmith role are intriguing, but her "no-nonsense" trait feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with the emotional depth shown; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a distinct arc or tension within the word limit; while the concept of preserved traditions shapes the narrative, the pacing feels repetitive and the resolution is more thematic than structural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is evocative and complements the tone, with sensory details like hammer strikes enhancing atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and stained glass feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic reflection on humanity, with symbolism around the stained glass, but it leans heavily on telling over showing; the theme of legacy is clear but lacks deeper subtext or a gripping central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise is unique, the language often feels repetitive ("heartbeat" overuse) and overly ornate, bordering on purple prose; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, and the narrative follows a predictable pattern without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style feels overly sentimental, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of legacy, yet the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
