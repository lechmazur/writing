<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear, but the "guarded" trait feels underdeveloped and lacks impact on actions or voice; reactions to the bookmark are vague and fail to reveal deeper personality nuances.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; the connection between decrypting vows and grassroots movements is tenuous and lacks logical cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vividly described with bioluminescent imagery, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are limited beyond sight, and the setting's connection to the bookmark feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with "angry peace," but it feels stated rather than shown; symbolism of the bookmark is present but lacks depth; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying due to weak conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>While the nano-forest offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable themes of revival and unity without subversion; emotional handling is surface-level, and metaphors like "symphony of angry peace" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels like a limitation, not a deliberate choice.</comment>
