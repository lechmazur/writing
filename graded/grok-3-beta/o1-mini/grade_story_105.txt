<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Evelyn's outcast status is mentioned but not deeply explored or integrated into her actions or voice. Motivation feels vague and lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect relationships are not fully convincing within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are intriguing with the witch's garage and half-lit corridor, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of "frantic peace" is inconsistently conveyed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact and deeper subtext; symbolism of the seashell and soul mirroring feels forced and underexplored. The ending is unsatisfyingly vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable magical tropes. Writing lacks a distinct style, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. It lacks depth and a lingering impact despite creative potential.</comment>
