<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive phrases like "loud silence"; metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles to cohesively integrate numerous elements; style is overly ornate, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
