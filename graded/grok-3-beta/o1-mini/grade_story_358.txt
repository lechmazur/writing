<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eldric's "old-fashioned" trait is mentioned but not explored in depth, and his motivation to claim an uncharted frontier feels vague and lacks personal stakes or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the unfolding riddle drives the narrative but feels repetitive without significant progression or a satisfying endpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse setting is evocative and ties to the tone of sanctified dread, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and object feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or a strong central conflict; imagery around reflections is intriguing but overused, and the ending feels inconclusive rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "ephemeral encounters," "unfolding riddle") and generic descriptors; the narrative feels formulaic with little subversion of tropes or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced, and the style leans toward overwriting, obscuring clarity and depth.</comment>
