<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to spark flames in a land of ice is clear, but the earnest knight lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with celestial alignment as a turning point, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between mapping tears and triggering flames are tenuous and illogical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of ruined aqueducts in a desert is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of desolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of crisp nostalgia feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the canvas of life, but emotional impact is shallow due to overt telling rather than showing; ending feels forced rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable knight-quest tropes without subversion; metaphors like "canvas of life" are overused and lack freshness; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style is overly ornate, hindering clarity; lacks lingering depth or creative spark beyond surface narrative.</comment>
