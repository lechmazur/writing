<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elena's role as a dog walker for the ultra-rich feels incidental, and her "carefully careless" nature lacks depth or consistent impact on her actions. Motivation to face fear is stated but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the transition from blood drive to haunted mansion feels abrupt and unmotivated within the word limit. The arc lacks a strong middle, and pacing feels rushed toward the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative imagery of "loud silence" and the mansion's eerie ambiance, but sensory details are sparse, and the blood drive setting feels disconnected from the haunted mansion dining room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there’s some subtext with silent agreements, emotional resonance is weak due to telling over showing. The ending feels more poetic than purposeful, lacking a strong conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from reliance on gothic tropes without subversion; phrases like "color bled from day into night" feel overused. Emotional handling is surface-level, and the narrative lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced together rather than organically integrated. The style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the story doesn’t leave a lasting impression.</comment>
