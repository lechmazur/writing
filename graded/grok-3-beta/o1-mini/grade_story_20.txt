<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eli's disappointment as an archer is stated but not deeply explored through actions or inner conflict. Motivation to chronicle social movements feels disconnected from his personal arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but the connection between Eli's personal regrets and social chronicling is forced and underdeveloped. Pacing feels rushed within the word limit, lacking depth in key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial timeframe create a surreal atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to Eli's motivation feels more symbolic than immersive or integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance; symbolism (comb, bridge) is heavy-handed and tells rather than shows. The ending feels predictable, and thereâ€™s little subtext or lasting impact beyond surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by generic metaphors (bridge of regret) and stated emotions rather than nuanced reactions. Writing feels formulaic at times, lacking a distinct voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. Style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
