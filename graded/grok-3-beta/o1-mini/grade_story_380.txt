<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to coax thunder is intriguing but lacks depth in execution; the "mathematically challenged" trait feels superficially applied and doesn't significantly shape actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced in connecting fragmented self to thunder; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution undermining the buildup within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Treehouse library setting is evocative and ties to solitude, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere doesn't fully amplify the quiet mania or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with solitude and hope, but reliance on telling over showing (e.g., "sense of fulfillment") weakens impact; ending feels predictable, lacking subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but execution leans on generic descriptors and predictable tropes (reviving a dead world); metaphors like "fragmented self" are overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story shows effort in cohesion, but elements feel more imposed than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
