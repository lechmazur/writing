<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the impoundment action feels underexplored as a driver; pacing is uneven with rushed resolutions and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underground mushroom farm is evocative and ties well to the tone of frantic peace, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to uncharted grief feels superficial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of truthfully lying offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering depth or unique style to elevate it beyond a functional narrative.</comment>
