<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Ethan's "groggy brewer" trait feels incidental rather than integral to his actions or personality, and his motivation lacks depth or specificity beyond a vague idealism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there is a discernible arc, the connection between the ritual and the protest feels forced, and pacing is rushed, sacrificing clarity for symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere often leans on clich√©s rather than unique imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some symbolism with the mirror, emotional resonance is weak due to overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from reliance on gothic tropes without subversion; language is occasionally overwrought, and emotional descriptions lack nuance, feeling formulaic and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated, and the style prioritizes symbolism over clarity, leaving little lasting impact or depth.</comment>
