<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's introversion and dancer background are present but underexplored; her motivation to escape feels clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance or backstory to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with knitting driving the narrative, but the connection between actions and celestial decoding feels forced at times; pacing is adequate but rushed at the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cipher decoder's office and desolate wasteland create a moody backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional stakes of Mara's journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of knitting as decoding is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of escape and isolation without fresh subversion; emotional portrayal feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
