<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's fainthearted nature is mentioned but not deeply explored or consistently reflected in actions; motivation to uncover secrets feels surface-level and lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and lacks clear cause-effect connections; the action of drifting through patterns drives the story but isn't logically grounded within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on repetitive phrases like "intimately distant" and generic descriptors; lacks originality in metaphor and emotional nuance, feeling formulaic and predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but feels forced rather than cohesive; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
