<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ava's motivation to track migratory butterflies as a reflection of her fragmented heart is intriguing, but her personality as a "wayward apothecary" lacks depth and distinct voice; her actions feel more symbolic than grounded in consistent character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "infecting" with hope feels forced and abstract, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with overly dense exposition that hampers momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details like gears and oil-lit lamps, enhancing the atmosphere, but the connection between the setting and the butterflies feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through Ava and Elias's connection, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of butterflies and Morse code is present but lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the steampunk setting and Morse code method show some originality, the narrative relies on predictable romantic tropes without subversion; emotional descriptions are often stated rather than nuanced, and metaphors like the "fragmented heart" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative, feeling constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
