<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Arlo's "polite bandit" persona and motivation to master time are intriguing but underdeveloped; his actions lack depth in reflecting his politeness or silence, and his voice feels generic without distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the harp's notes and the chip's sanctuary is tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond surface narrative.</comment>
