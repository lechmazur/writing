<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to study tide patterns is clear, but the "sapped herbalist" trait feels underexplored and disconnected from actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions to the bellows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; connection between tide study and goose flight path is tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed introspection at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the glass-walled observatory is evocative and ties well to the ocean theme, with strong sensory details of sea and sky; however, atmosphere only partially supports the fervent indifference tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through Evelynâ€™s struggle, with decent use of symbolism (bellows, goose); yet, lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending, and conflict resolution feels vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like the goose and tide study, but metaphors (e.g., bellows as energy) are somewhat generic; emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
