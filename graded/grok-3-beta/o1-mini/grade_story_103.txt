<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to hush regret is clear, but the weatherbeaten knight's personality lacks depth beyond generic stoicism; reactions to objects and reflections feel predictable, missing a distinct voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the concept of impossible choices drives the narrative, though cause-effect links in the escape pattern are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse prison is vividly described and enhances the tone of joyful agony; sensory details like crashing waves are effective, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through themes of regret and self-forgiveness; symbolism of the brass knocker is strong, but the ending feels slightly overwrought, lacking subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the mirrored reflections as a narrative device, but reliance on knight-in-solitude trope feels formulaic; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally veers into ornate prose; length feels managed, though depth is sacrificed, and lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
