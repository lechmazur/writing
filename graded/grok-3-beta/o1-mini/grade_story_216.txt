<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between refashioning the washer and identity recovery lacks clear cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cloud City setting is evocative with neon lights, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the obsessive calm tone, missing deeper integration with Lena’s emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the washer, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of Lena’s transformation rather than showing nuanced reactions; lacks a memorable or unique perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on repetitive phrases like "robustly delicate" and generic descriptors, lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional depth, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constructed around them rather than using them organically; lacks lingering depth or a deliberate sense of brevity, resulting in a superficial impact.</comment>
