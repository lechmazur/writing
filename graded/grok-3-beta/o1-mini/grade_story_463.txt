<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the dance as a method to mend promises is intriguing but underdeveloped within the word limit, leading to rushed pacing and weak cause-effect links.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on repetitive phrases like "reckless precision" and generic descriptors; lacks originality with predictable ghostly dance trope and little subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but feels constructed around them rather than organic; lacks depth or a lingering thought, with style occasionally hindering clarity through repetition.</comment>
