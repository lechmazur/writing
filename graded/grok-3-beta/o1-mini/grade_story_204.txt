<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases like "ancient novelty" and "unspoken rules" feel formulaic, and the narrative lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, leaning on predictable transformation tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
