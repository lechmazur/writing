<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Mira's "strongly weak" attribute is inconsistently portrayed, with inner resilience mentioned but not convincingly shown through actions; motivation to track social changes feels vague and lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; levitation as an action feels arbitrary and disconnected from tracking legends, disrupting coherence and pacing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable tropes of mystical relics and spiritual journeys without subversion; language feels ornate and generic at times, lacking a distinct authorial voice or nuance in emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite assigned elements; the story feels forced around them rather than organically integrated, with style and brevity hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
