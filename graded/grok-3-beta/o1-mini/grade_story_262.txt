<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the alien-teacher premise offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable tropes of hidden identity and lost knowledge without fresh subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
