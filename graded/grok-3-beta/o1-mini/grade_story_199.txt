<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliot's overzealousness as a park ranger is evident, but his motivation to catch the goddess's echo lacks depth and emotional grounding, making his actions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between Eliot's actions and the orchard's transformation is not fully logical or earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a repurposed highway overpass is vividly described and enhances the mystical tone, with sensory details like whispering winds, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its themes of legacy and guardianship, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the setting is unique, the narrative leans on familiar mystical tropes without subversion, and some descriptions feel generic or overly ornate, lacking a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with florid language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
