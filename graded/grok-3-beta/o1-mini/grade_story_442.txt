<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's "edgy" nature and "comfortingly pessimistic" attribute are mentioned but lack depth or distinct voice; motivation feels vague and reactions to objects like the flyer are superficial without revealing nuanced personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; pacing feels meandering with no strong cause-effect links, and the action of "vectorizing" memories is conceptually unclear, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The giant mushroom house setting is evocative and ties to the surreal tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of the windmill rotation feels disconnected from the atmosphere and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with memory distortion and the candle, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending lacks satisfaction, and central conflict is too abstract to resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the surreal approach offers some originality, metaphors like "vectorize" feel forced and generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts unnaturally between vividness and void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
