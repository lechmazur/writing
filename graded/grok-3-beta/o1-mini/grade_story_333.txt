<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sara's portrayal as a sincere rebel is somewhat clear, but her motivation lacks depth and specificity; her reactions to the torn sticky note and passage feel predictable rather than revealing unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the constantly changing passage, while central, doesn't fully drive logical cause-and-effect progression; coherence is strained by repetitive focus on internal conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms create a fitting atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and generic, missing opportunities to deepen immersion; tone aligns with concept but lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through Sara's journey, but it heavily relies on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the sticky note feels forced, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on gothic tropes without subversion, and descriptions are often repetitive or overly ornate; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, lacking originality in style or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story integrates assigned elements, it feels constructed around them rather than using them organically; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth or lingering impact.</comment>
