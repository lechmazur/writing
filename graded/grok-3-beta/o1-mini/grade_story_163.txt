<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to push limits is clear, but Eleanor's personality lacks depth; her "bitterly optimistic" trait feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the unifying action driving the story, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the parking stub and fragmented reality is tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the xenobiology station and migration of clouds creates an intriguing backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation or tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with reality unification, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, lacking a strong central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable sci-fi tropes of fragmented realities without subversion; metaphors like "dancing clouds" are generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than evoked through nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but feels forced around them rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or clarity, with style occasionally overreaching into ornate language.</comment>
