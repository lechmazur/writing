<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amelia's portrayal as a brainy observer is evident, but her motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes; the porcelain doll's significance is symbolic but not deeply tied to her actions or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of enforcing through street art feels repetitive and doesn't drive a compelling narrative progression or conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, but the connection to faster-than-light travel feels superficial; sensory details are present but not consistently evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story has some emotional resonance and symbolism with the doll and impermanence, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending lacks a strong impact or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of ephemeral art is intriguing, the writing often feels formulaic with repetitive phrases like "fleeting" and "timeless"; emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brief length exposes a lack of narrative depth or lingering impact.</comment>
