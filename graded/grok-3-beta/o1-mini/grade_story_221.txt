<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to break free from family expectations is clear, but the wreck-diver ghost whisperer trait feels underexplored and disconnected from the carnival setting, lacking depth in how it shapes Mira's actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with spirit interactions; connections between beginning and end are present but lack a stronger causal link to feel fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocative and supports the melancholic tone well with sensory details, but the connection to Mira’s ghost-whispering background feels tenuous and underutilized in enhancing the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through Mira’s journey, with some effective symbolism (amber as vulnerability), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict resolution feels predictable and surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of breaking tradition without fresh subversion; metaphors like “thawing heart” feel somewhat generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown with subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
