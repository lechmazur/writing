<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Luna's free-spirited herbalist nature and academically artistic traits are mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or distinct voice, leaving motivations somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; while there is a beginning and end, the middle feels repetitive with stitching and reading letters, lacking clear progression or tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coral restoration station setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and Luna's emotional journey feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance with symbolism of stitching and corals, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing emotions, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive phrasing and generic descriptors like "hollow echoes of shame"; emotional handling lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story integrates elements with moderate cohesion but lacks depth and creative spark; it feels constrained by its length rather than deliberately concise, missing a lingering impact.</comment>
