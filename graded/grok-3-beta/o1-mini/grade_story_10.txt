<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Jarek's cheerlessness and duelist nature are stated but not deeply explored through actions or distinct voice. Motivation to learn forgiveness feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; the action of elasticizing the chest feels disconnected from a coherent progression. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are moderately evocative with the hum of server rooms, but sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse. Connection between setting and object feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; symbolism of the chest is heavy-handed, and the theme of forgiveness is stated rather than shown through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by predictable emotional beats and generic descriptors; metaphors like "hardened heart" are clich√©d, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than seamlessly integrated. The story lacks depth and lingering impact beyond surface-level resolution.</comment>
