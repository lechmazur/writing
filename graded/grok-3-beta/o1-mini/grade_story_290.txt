<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the overthrow as a central action, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between the taxi ride and cosmic shift are tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative feels formulaic with predictable tropes of rebellion and cosmic balance; metaphors are generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While some elements are creatively combined, the story lacks cohesion and depth; it feels constrained by its length rather than deliberately concise, with little lingering impact.</comment>
