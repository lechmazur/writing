<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Evelyn's "flighty" nature is mentioned but not convincingly shown through actions or decisions; her motivation to leave a legacy feels stated rather than deeply explored or emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the map's creation and revelation, but the action of linearizing feels forced and lacks clear causality; pacing is uneven with repetitive elements slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The secret society initiation hall is atmospheric but lacks vivid sensory detail; the tone of serene anger is inconsistently conveyed and doesn't fully mesh with the setting or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The story lacks emotional depth or subtext; it tells rather than shows Evelyn's feelings and struggles, and the ending feels predictable without a strong lingering impact or theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases like "strangely normal" and "serene anger" feel formulaic; the narrative lacks originality, relying on predictable secret society tropes without fresh perspective or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements but feels constructed around them rather than driven by organic narrative; it lacks depth or a lingering question, and the style is functional but uninspired.</comment>
