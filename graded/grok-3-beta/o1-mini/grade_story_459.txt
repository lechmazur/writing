<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's ability to see ghosts is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to find liberation feels vague and lacks depth in execution. His clumsiness is a distinct trait but doesn't consistently shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but the action of dissecting silence feels forced and abstract. Pacing is uneven within the word limit, with rushed emotional resolution and unclear cause-effect links between ghost tours and personal growth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is an unusual setting but poorly integrated with the timeframe of lunch breaks; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully support the ghostly or emotional tone of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with mutual loss, but it relies on telling rather than showing. Symbolism of the flower crown is heavy-handed, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful; lacks subtext or deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative feels formulaic with generic descriptors of silence and ghosts; metaphors like the flower crown are overused and lack freshness. Emotional handling is surface-level, and the tone shifts unnaturally between clumsiness and solemnity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organic. The style lacks clarity, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a choice. Lacks lingering depth or creative spark.</comment>
