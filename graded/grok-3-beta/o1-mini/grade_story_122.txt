<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with the cyber-templarâ€™s drive to shatter illusions, but the personality lacks depth and distinctiveness; the "patiently frantic" attribute feels forced and inconsistently portrayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the struggle against the storm, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, lacking a fully satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sky burial site setting is evocative and ties to the theme of transition, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of euphoric agitation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with the mirage of safety, but emotional impact is muted due to reliance on telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining cybernetic and templar elements, but leans on generic descriptors and predictable storm symbolism; emotional nuance is lacking, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is functional but lacks clarity and depth to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
