<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels repetitive and lacks tension; the action of excavating memories drives the story but pacing is uneven, with overemphasis on description over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the sky-lounge and endless city is evocative and supports the mood of perpetual night, but sensory details are sparse and garden secrets feel underexplored as a timeframe element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the map and broken watch band, but emotional impact is muted by repetitive imagery and lack of subtext; ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on repetitive phrases like "endless night" and generic metaphors, lacking originality; emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but feels forced in places; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and while thereâ€™s creative intent, the impact is shallow and forgettable.</comment>
