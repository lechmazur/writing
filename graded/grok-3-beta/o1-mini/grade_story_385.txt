<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Evelyn's manipulative nature is clear, but her character lacks depth beyond this trait; her motivation to decode symbols feels surface-level and her connection to the ice skates is vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of weakening the ward feels repetitive and lacks clear causality; pacing is uneven with overemphasis on symbolic decoding at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital ward setting create a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and the connection between setting and action feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with seeds and symbols, but lacks emotional resonance or subtext; the ending feels predictable and the writing over-relies on telling rather than showing character intent and emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on overused metaphors like "scattered seeds" without fresh interpretation; tone shifts are unnatural, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic construction over unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it feels constructed around them rather than using them in service of a cohesive narrative; it lacks lingering impact or creative depth beyond the surface plot.</comment>
