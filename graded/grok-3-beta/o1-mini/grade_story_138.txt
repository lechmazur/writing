<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to cut through illusions is present but lacks depth; Lord Alaric's personality feels underdeveloped and his reactions to the hummingbird drone or ticket stubs reveal little beyond surface-level resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with reassembly driving action, but pacing feels rushed and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, lacking a fully satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the spontaneous combustion lab is evocative with sensory details like burning wires, but its connection to character motivation and tone of hollow recklessness feels forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the drone and ticket stubs, but emotional impact is minimal; lacks subtext or deeper conflict, relying on stated themes rather than showing through action or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows repetitive phrasing (e.g., "hollow recklessness," "candor in small moments") and generic descriptors, lacking originality; metaphors feel overused and emotional resonance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style is overly ornate and hinders clarity; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, with little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
