<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the action of docking feels abrupt and disconnected from a coherent progression, leaving the story feeling fragmented.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal power monitoring station setting is evocative and ties to the unpredictable tides, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the story's tone and motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the candle mold and spark, but emotional impact is shallow, and the ending feels more confusing than satisfying; subtext is present but not compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on generic metaphors (e.g., "relentless tides") and stated emotions rather than shown nuance; lacks originality in perspective and feels formulaic in tone shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by forced integration of elements; the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
