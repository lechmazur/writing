<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to document dying dialects is clear, but Aldric's personality as an ambitious brewer feels underdeveloped and disconnected from his linguistic quest; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times; the connection between deciphering bruises and finding lost paths is intriguing yet not fully logical or fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, unique atmosphere that enhances the story's mood; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through Aldric's mission, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable literary devices; ending is purposeful but not particularly striking; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining brewing with linguistic preservation, but reliance on predictable "hidden passage" trope and generic descriptors like "harsh winds" detract; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity seems more a limitation than a choice; leaves a lingering thought about cultural preservation, though not powerfully executed; style is clear but unremarkable.</comment>
