<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but metaphors like "braided bitterness" feel overwrought; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
