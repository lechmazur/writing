<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Evelyn's focus as a collector is clear, but her motivation to triumph over despair feels somewhat forced and underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between board game rounds and the frost giant's lair is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is evocative and ties to the tone of earnest flippancy, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the black rose as a symbol, but emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar tropes of inner turmoil as a predator; metaphors like the black rose are somewhat generic, lacking fresh nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but not in a way that elevates the narrative to a memorable or publishable level.</comment>
