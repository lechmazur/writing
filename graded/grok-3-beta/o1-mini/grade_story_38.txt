<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Evan's insomnia and poetic nature shape his actions, but his motivations feel somewhat vague and inconsistently tied to non-violence; lacks a distinct voice in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between elements like whispers and non-violence are forced, disrupting coherence and pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and botanical samples create a vivid atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse; the tone of empty abundance contrasts well, yet lacks deeper integration with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Evanâ€™s journey, but symbolism (plants, whispers) feels heavy-handed; ending is purposeful yet lacks impactful subtext or tension resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of the tortured artist; metaphors are somewhat generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks depth or lingering impact beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
