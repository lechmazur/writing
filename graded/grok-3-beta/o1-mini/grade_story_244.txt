<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; Mira's guilt and reserved boldness are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict, resulting in a superficial portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and lacks clear cause-effect connections; the pursuit of the door of release drives the story, yet transitions between events are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop setting is evocative with sensory details like neon hums, but its connection to the tribal mask and broader atmosphere feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; while imagery like the mask's glow is present, the narrative relies on telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite incorporating assigned elements; the story feels built around them rather than using them organically, and the style lacks clarity or lasting impact.</comment>
