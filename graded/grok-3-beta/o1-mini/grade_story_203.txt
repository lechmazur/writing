<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Evelyn's stage fright as an exorcist feels underexplored and lacks depth in influencing her actions beyond a passing mention. Motivation is present but not fully convincing or distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of submerging is metaphorical but lacks clear impact on the narrative arc. Coherence is strained by abrupt shifts, and pacing feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting of orbital debris is intriguing but underutilized; atmosphere is inconsistent, with sensory details sparse and failing to fully immerse. Tone of defiant hush partially supports mood but lacks reinforcement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and literary devices like symbolism of flowers feel forced. Ending lacks a strong punch, leaving little lasting impression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. Style lacks clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
