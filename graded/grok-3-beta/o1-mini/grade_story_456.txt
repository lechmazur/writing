<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand cosmic cycles is clear, but her personality as a "morbid florist" with "neutrally passionate" traits feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between Elara's actions and the cosmic cycles concept lacks logical grounding or impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting is evocative and complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elara's motivation or the story's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the candle and lantern, but lacks emotional resonance, deeper subtext, or a satisfying conflict resolution; it tells more than shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the setting is unique, the narrative relies on predictable mystical tropes without subversion, and the language occasionally veers into generic or overly ornate descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but lacks clarity and depth; it doesn't leave a lingering impact or demonstrate significant creative risk.</comment>
