<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elara's secretive nature and motivation to preserve folk medicines are present but underdeveloped; her "angrily peaceful" attribute feels forced and lacks depth in shaping her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the connection between marathon training and the supernatural elements feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolutions and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative and ties to the tone of aloof passion, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elara's motivation or the teapot's significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with the teapot and spirits, but emotional impact is shallow due to telling over showing; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, lacking nuanced conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the execution relies on predictable supernatural tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, and the style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
