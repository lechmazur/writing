<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the deputy's impassivity and personal impersonality are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, leaving motivation feeling abstract and unconvincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; while there is a beginning and end, the middle feels meandering with no clear conflict or progression, making the story feel incomplete despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of the lush orchard and abandoned cathedral is evocative and well-described with sensory details, but its connection to the character’s motivation and the story’s tone feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some imagery and symbolism, the emotional resonance is weak, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch, relying on stated rather than shown emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic descriptors and overused metaphors like "dappled sunlight"; the narrative feels formulaic at times, lacking a distinct voice or fresh perspective on the assigned elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style leans toward overwriting, obscuring clarity and depth in favor of ornate language.</comment>
