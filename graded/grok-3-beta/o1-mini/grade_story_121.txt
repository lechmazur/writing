<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to unify conflicting hearts is clear, but his "shifty" nature and spontaneous attribute feel underdeveloped and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tailing caravans and the parole hearing feels tenuous, with pacing rushed at critical emotional turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in theater setting is evocative and ties to the tone of anguished joy, but sensory details are sparse, and the surreal caravans clash somewhat with the grounded atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overwrought phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a profound lingering impact.</comment>
