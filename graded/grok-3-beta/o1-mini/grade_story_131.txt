<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Eli's aloofness and transformation from fear to courage are stated rather than deeply explored through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but the arc feels predictable and lacks a compelling escalation of tension; the gravitational anomaly and message integration feel somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates an intriguing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance with the theme of adaptation, but reliance on explicit statements over showing through action diminishes impact; symbolism of stones is promising but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable transformation narrative and generic descriptors; emotional handling feels surface-level, lacking nuanced subtext or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but often feel like obligations rather than organic components, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
