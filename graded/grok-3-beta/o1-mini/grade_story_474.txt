<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters Ava and Leo lack depth; their motivations are stated but not deeply explored or felt, resulting in superficial development despite the intriguing premise of channeling the dead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there’s a discernible arc, the integration of cooking class and radio broadcasts feels forced, and pacing is rushed within the word limit, sacrificing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The celestial grotto setting is evocative but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the characters’ motivations or the story’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance; symbolism (e.g., chessboard) is heavy-handed, and the theme of diversity feels didactic rather than organically shown through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable metaphors and generic emotional descriptors; the narrative feels formulaic at times, lacking a distinct authorial voice or nuanced human emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel imposed rather than integral, and the style lacks clarity or lasting impact despite some creative intent.</comment>
