<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the sneering envoy's personality lacks depth beyond the sneer, and motivation feels abstract without grounding in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a vague arc, the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid with strong sensory details like aromas and metallic tang, but the tone’s contrast with the barren alien plain feels overdone and inconsistent at times.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly ornate language and generic metaphors like “cup starlight”; lacks nuanced emotion and feels formulaic in parts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style prioritizes flourish over clarity, diminishing impact.</comment>
