<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Evelyn's daring nature as a pathfinder is evident, but her "ingeniously clueless" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions. Motivation to solve the riddle is clear but not deeply explored, and her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the riddle as a driving force, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments. Connections between beginning and end are present but lack seamless coherence; the roller coaster's transformation feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of quiet mania, but sensory details are sparse and unevenly distributed. The atmosphere supports the mystery, though the connection between setting and object feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with the riddle's resolution, but emotional impact is muted due to reliance on telling over showing. Imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels predictable rather than satisfying. Central conflict lacks tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The narrative leans on familiar tropes of haunted settings and ancient riddles without subversion. Descriptions are generic at times, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced. Some originality in combining elements, but overall style lacks a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative rather than organic. Style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a strength. Lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
