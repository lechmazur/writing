<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the swordsman’s shift from arrogance to humility, but the transformation feels surface-level and lacks depth in motivation; the "doubtfully confident" trait is mentioned but not vividly explored through actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the tapestry fragment and the action of authorizing the journey is underdeveloped, leading to a lack of logical cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of transformation, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of "harsh tenderness" feels inconsistently applied, missing opportunities to deepen the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance with the swordsman’s inner struggle, and the tapestry as a symbol works, but the writing often tells rather than shows, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly impactful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive phrases like "between breaths" and "harsh tenderness," which feel formulaic; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brief length exposes underdeveloped ideas rather than showcasing deliberate restraint; it lacks a lingering depth or question.</comment>
