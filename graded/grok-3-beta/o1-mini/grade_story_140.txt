<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eliot's "tortured protector" role lacks depth beyond surface-level torment, and his motivations shift without sufficient grounding or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there’s a discernible arc, pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between the doll and transformation are vague and unconvincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is moderately evocative with moonlight and circus relics, but sensory details are generic, and the setting’s connection to character motivation feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or subtext; symbolism of the doll is heavy-handed, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clichéd tropes of transformation and "facing the unknown"; writing lacks nuance, with overly stated emotions and generic imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative, and the style lacks clarity or depth to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
