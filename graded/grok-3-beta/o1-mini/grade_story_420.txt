<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting of fossilized dinosaur bones is evocative and ties symbolically to themes of endurance, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere occasionally feels overwrought rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through themes of transformation and light, with some effective imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
