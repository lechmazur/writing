<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Mara's blunt heretic trait is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue; her motivation to match wits is clear but lacks depth or personal stakes beyond surface-level determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the battle through jumbled codes feels contrived and disconnected from a logical progression; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library and deserted temple setting is evocative and supports the tone of anxious elation, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection to the teddy bear feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the teddy bear and old promises, but emotional impact is shallow due to telling rather than showing; the ending feels abrupt and lacks a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable tropes of ancient mysteries and mental duels without subversion; language is overly ornate at times, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While some assigned elements are integrated, the story lacks cohesion and depth; the style is inconsistent, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
