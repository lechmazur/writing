<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thaddeus's motivation to resurrect buried talents is clear, but his "infuriatingly calm" attribute feels underexplored and does not significantly shape his actions or personality beyond a surface mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between tweaking the pencil and decoding piano keys lacks deeper logical grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
