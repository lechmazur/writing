<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to confront remorse is present but lacks depth; his transformation feels surface-level and not fully earned through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between interrogating ghosts and personal redemption is underdeveloped and somewhat illogical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is intriguing but lacks vivid sensory detail to enhance atmosphere; the tone of mild fervor clashes with the bleakness without clear intent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance through Leo’s remorse, but heavy reliance on telling over showing and repetitive symbolism (empty tape dispenser) diminishes impact; ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing leans on clichés like ghostly apparitions and redemption without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling formulaic and overly stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but they often feel forced rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or creative spark to elevate it beyond a basic narrative.</comment>
