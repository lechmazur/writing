<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by clich√©d tropes of magical transformation and predictable poetic awakening; metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the story lacks a lingering depth or question for the reader.</comment>
