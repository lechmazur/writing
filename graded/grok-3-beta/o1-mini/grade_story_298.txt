<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with the action of reproducing stories through solving mysteries introduced but not fully resolved; pacing is uneven, rushing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace and post-oil timeframe are evocative, and sunlight through debris enhances mood, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Li Wei's quest, and symbolism of the dress is effective, but the lack of dialogue and over-reliance on telling rather than showing diminishes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution leans on predictable themes of art healing the past; metaphors like "light and shadow" feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often feels ornate, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a surface narrative.</comment>
