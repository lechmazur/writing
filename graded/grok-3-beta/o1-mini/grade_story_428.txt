<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the shift from city planner to doomsday prepper feels underexplored, and Rajiv's actions, while consistent, lack a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the ink blotter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between studying constellations and escaping chains is vague, and pacing suffers from abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows traces of formulaic phrasing and generic descriptors; metaphors like "self-imposed chains" are clich√©d, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite incorporating assigned elements; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
