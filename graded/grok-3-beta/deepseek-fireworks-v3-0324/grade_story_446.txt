<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to restore a lost kingdom is intriguing but underdeveloped; the amiable nature feels surface-level and lacks depth in action or dialogue to reveal inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is vague, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on imagery over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Firefly breeding grounds create a vivid, atmospheric setting with strong sensory detail, but the connection to character motivation and plot feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some effective imagery and symbolism (petal falling, fireflies) evoke thought, but emotional impact is muted by lack of clear conflict or tension; ending feels more poetic than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While imagery is occasionally fresh, the narrative leans on predictable metaphors (petals falling, light as hope) and lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often prioritizes ornate language over clarity; depth is hinted at but not fully realized within the brief length.</comment>
