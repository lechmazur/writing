<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode star maps is clear, but the "bright-eyed" attribute feels superficial and underexplored in shaping personality or actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, driven by decoding star maps, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained despite word limit constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse basement enhances eerie atmosphere and complements the tone of brazen calm; sensory details like bioluminescent algae are evocative, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity about the stars, with some effective imagery (e.g., constellations glowing), but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining star maps and a post-apocalyptic setting, but metaphors like "weight of discovery" are generic; emotional nuance is limited, relying on stated resolve rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the phone booth key, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering question about the future, though depth is moderate.</comment>
