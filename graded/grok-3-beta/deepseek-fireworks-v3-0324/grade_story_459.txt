<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, but his motivation for liberation feels underdeveloped and inconsistently tied to his actions; his reactions to the flower crown reveal some depth, though his voice lacks distinctiveness in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc within the word limit, and the action of dissecting silence drives the story forward; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is evocative and complements the tone of complex simplicity, with sensory details like the ocean's rhythm enhancing mood; yet, the connection between setting and timeframe (lunch breaks) feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Eli's release of the flower crown, with effective symbolism and a satisfying ending; however, dialogue is minimal and lacks impact, and the central conflict feels understated for the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining ghosts with sand castle preservation, and metaphors like petals as confetti are fresh; yet, emotional handling occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; however, the style sometimes overcomplicates clarity, and the lingering impact is present but not profoundly memorable.</comment>
