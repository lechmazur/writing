<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness is present but underdeveloped; their transformation from detachment to determination lacks depth due to limited internal conflict or backstory. Motivation is clear but feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the anomaly driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is evocative and enhances the mood of uncertainty, with sensory details like the "softly audible hum" adding immersion. However, the garage setting feels underutilized beyond its initial role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eli's shift in courage, and the stones as anchors offer some symbolism. However, the ending feels predictable, and subtext is minimal, lacking deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the anomaly concept is intriguing, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of personal transformation without subversion. Sensory details are adequate but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but it lacks a lingering impact or profound depth. The style is clear but unremarkable, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
