<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The amiable scholar's personality is hinted at through a calm demeanor and curiosity, but lacks depth or distinct voice; motivation to fuse lore and dreams is clear but not deeply explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the concept of navigating shadows, though pacing feels slightly rushed and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly rendered with sensory details like creaking timbers and storm sounds, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery, though the waiting room timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of discovery, with effective imagery and symbolism, but lacks a strong central conflict and deeper subtext beyond surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on a haunted setting, some metaphors (e.g., shadows as tides) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the lighthouse and shadows, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
