<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a lovelorn spy is clear, but development feels surface-level; emotional depth is stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between past mistakes and current stakes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Futuristic city slums are vividly described with neon and decay, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details lack variety beyond visual imagery, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through longing and reunion, with some effective symbolism (sticky label as hope), but dialogue is minimal and lacks impact; subtext is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the spy-lost-love trope feels predictable without fresh subversion; metaphors like “avalanche of mistakes” are overused, and emotional resonance relies on explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
