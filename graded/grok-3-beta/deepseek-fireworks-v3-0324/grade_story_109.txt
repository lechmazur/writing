<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric’s cold nature and lawful rebelliousness are present but underdeveloped; his personal motivation for his sister feels genuine but lacks depth in execution due to limited exploration of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the mitten and altar driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the secret agent center’s role in the story remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The late-night deserted intersection and frosty atmosphere effectively enhance the mood of isolation and urgency, with strong sensory details like misting breath, though the secret agent center feels underexplored as a setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Aldric’s thawing coldness, and the mitten as a symbol of resilience is intriguing, but the theme of hope feels surface-level, with dialogue lacking distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the knight’s transformation and the healing altar trope lack fresh subversion; sensory details are adequate but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative combination of ideas, settling for a competent rather than exceptional execution.</comment>
