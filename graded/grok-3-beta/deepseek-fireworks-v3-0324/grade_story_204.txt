<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Mara’s role as a professional cuddler is mentioned but lacks depth in shaping her actions or voice. Motivation to overcome prejudice feels stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent within the word limit, but the connection between beginning and end feels vague. The concept of decay drives the narrative minimally, and pacing feels rushed toward an ambiguous resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details like decay and overripe fruit, enhancing the abandoned spaceport setting. However, the timeframe of the acceptance speech feels underutilized and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with imagery and subtext around decay and renewal, but emotional resonance is shallow. Dialogue is functional but not distinctive, and the central conflict lacks sharp definition or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic metaphors (e.g., “broken pieces”) and predictable emotional beats. While the concept of a phantom ticket punch is intriguing, the execution lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels only partially cohesive; assigned elements are integrated but often superficially. The brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, and the lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
