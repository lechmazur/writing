<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to master an ancient art is clear, but the subdued vigilante's personality lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions to the bead and mirror feel symbolic but not personal enough to reveal nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the mirror distortions driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the ending lacks a fully coherent resolution, leaving cause-effect relationships vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of "screaming silence" and the abandoned waiting area effectively enhance the mood of desolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the mirror and bead feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through war's lingering cost, with decent use of symbolism (mirror, bead), but the ending feels unsatisfying, and the theme of surrender lacks deeper subtext or impactful showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept of war's price offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable tropes of guilt and haunting reflections without fresh subversion; metaphors like the mirror are overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only faint lingering impact.</comment>
