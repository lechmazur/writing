<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to outshine his reflection is intriguing but underdeveloped; the summoner’s personality lacks depth beyond ambition, and his voice feels indistinct despite the narrative focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between summoning and building collapse is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quantum beach setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like shimmering sand and ozone scent, strongly enhancing the atmosphere and complementing the tone of corroded rapture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity through imagery and subtext of ambition’s cost, but the ending feels abrupt; dialogue is purposeful yet sparse, and emotional depth is shown rather than told, though inconsistently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors like “shattered glass” grin are fresh, but others feel overwrought; tone is consistent, yet the narrative lacks a truly unique perspective, leaning on familiar summoning tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the quantum beach, but style occasionally veers into overly ornate language; it leaves a lingering question of cost, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
