<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to stage fright and inheritance of lies is intriguing but underdeveloped; the exorcistâ€™s actions align with resolve, yet lack depth in personal history or distinct voice to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; the action of submerging the haunting drives the story, though connections between elements like toy assembly and the core conflict are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of orbital debris and atmosphere of defiant hush are vividly rendered with strong sensory details like metallic groans and cold metal tomb, enhancing mood; however, toy assembly feels disconnected from the space setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of resilience, with decent use of symbolism (wildflowers); yet, the conflict resolution feels predictable, and subtext is present but not deeply layered or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors (wildflowers as anchor) are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar exorcism tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinct flair, and while it leaves a lingering thought, depth is limited by surface-level execution.</comment>
