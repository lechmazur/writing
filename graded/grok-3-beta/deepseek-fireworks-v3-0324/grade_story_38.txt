<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the insomniac poet's motivation to discover non-violence feels underdeveloped and disconnected from their actions, though their internal conflict shows some depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the action of elimination and the concept of non-violence lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting and timeframe between subway stops are evocatively rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of unease and isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has impact through vivid imagery and subtext about neglect as violence, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional resonance could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the thematic exploration of non-violence as presence, but some metaphors (e.g., whispers as vines) feel overused, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
