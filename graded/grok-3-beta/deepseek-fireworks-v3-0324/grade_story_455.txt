<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to out-face ghosts is clear but underdeveloped; the "intensely relaxed" attribute feels contradictory without deeper exploration of internal conflict. Dialogue lacks a distinct voice, feeling generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between corroborating rumors and the escape route are vague, disrupting logical flow. Pacing is uneven with abrupt shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of inherited mystery is evocative with effective use of shadows and the well as symbols, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story hints at deeper meaning with coins as unfulfilled wishes, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance. Dialogue is functional but not memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery (coins as unanswered prayers) is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable haunted-past tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
