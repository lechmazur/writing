<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with the labyrinth architect's crisis and desire to understand sacred geometry, but her personality lacks depth and distinct voice; reactions to the calling cards feel symbolic but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between evasion and the radio signals lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the migration pattern archive is evocative and ties to the concept of sacred geometry, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the desperate tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through unspoken bonds and farewells, with decent use of symbolism, but the ending feels unresolved without purpose, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors like labyrinths are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable emotional beats and generic descriptors; tone is consistent but lacks a truly unique style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative rather than serve it; style is clear but not striking, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
