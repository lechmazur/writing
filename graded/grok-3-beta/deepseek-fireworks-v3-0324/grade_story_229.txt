<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to honor an impossible promise is intriguing but underdeveloped; the inventor's mild curiosity feels inconsistent with the emotional weight of the pearl and the vision, lacking depth in reactions and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with rain patterns driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more poetic than logical, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sailing ship graveyard is vividly rendered with sensory details and enhances the cosmic intimacy tone; atmosphere supports the theme of loss and memory, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a melancholic response and uses strong imagery (rain as story fragments), but the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like "time is a storm" are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of ghostly visions and lost love without subversion; emotional resonance is shown but occasionally stated, missing deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like rain patterns, leaving a lingering sense of mystery, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
