<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development of Father Elias is adequate but lacks depth; his rattled nature and inward sociality are stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or dialogue, limiting insight into his motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the postcard and the hidden room resolution lacks sufficient buildup for impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere, with sensory details like dance lessons adding texture, though the integration of setting with character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with imagery like "shadows stretching like eager fingers," but the emotional resonance is shallow, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar tropes of hidden rooms and cryptic messages without fresh subversion; writing style is competent but lacks a distinct voice or innovative perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it fails to leave a lasting impression or demonstrate exceptional depth, feeling constrained rather than deliberate in its brevity.</comment>
