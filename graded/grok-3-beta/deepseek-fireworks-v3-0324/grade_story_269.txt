<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits is clear, but the nostalgic tailor’s personality feels underdeveloped; his reactions to the mirror lack depth beyond surface-level desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between confessions and ascension is not fully logical or earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steampunk observation deck and storm create a vivid atmosphere, with sensory details like thunder and gears enhancing mood, though the setting’s connection to parallel lives feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the tailor’s confessions, and imagery like golden threads is striking, but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel lives offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of mirrors and ascension without subversion; metaphors like “stitch in time” feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; lacks a truly lingering thought.</comment>
