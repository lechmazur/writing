<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to hush the crowd is clear, and the "clumsily dexterous" trait shapes actions, but the engineer lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions feel surface-level and predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of critique drives the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details like "forgotten frequencies" and "muted scream," enhancing the mood, though the witch's cauldron room feels underutilized in grounding the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on silence versus peace with effective imagery and symbolism (stained glass), but the ending lacks full satisfaction, and emotional depth is shown inconsistently, relying on some telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining silence as a weapon with pantomime, but metaphors like "tide he could no longer control" feel overused, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought on noise and control, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity at times.</comment>
