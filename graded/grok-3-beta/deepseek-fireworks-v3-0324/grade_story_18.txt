<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathic ability shapes its actions effectively, and its motivation to find truth is clear, but the tragic joyfulness feels underexplored in its personality and reactions, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with weatherizing driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the machine and city’s rot is underdeveloped, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly realized with sensory details like hissing pistons and slick cobblestones, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness, though the setting’s connection to the hair tie feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through the statue’s burden of truth, with strong imagery like “dance of ink and intention,” but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the central conflict feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is unique, some metaphors like “light of recognition” feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like calligraphy and telepathy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, reducing overall impact.</comment>
