<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s dazed nature and rebellious streak are evident, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; they feel more conceptual than personal, limiting emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of chalking messages feels repetitive and lacks escalating tension or clear resolution beyond the symbolic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The composer’s sound garden is vividly rendered with sensory details like humming secrets and singing fountains, strongly supporting the atmosphere, though its connection to the timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a poetic response through imagery and symbolism, but the dialogue feels slightly forced, and the central conflict remains abstract, lacking visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors (e.g., “cosmic dance”) feel overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally veers into overwrought prose, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
