<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear, but the glamorous undertaker's personality feels underdeveloped beyond surface traits; lacks a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of elongating stitches is present but doesn't drive a strong narrative progression, and pacing feels rushed at the end with unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the social network archive is evocative with holographic records, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through jubilant remorse, with some effective imagery (gown trailing like a shadow), but lacks deeper subtext or a satisfying resolution; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a glamorous undertaker is unique, metaphors like "tapestry fraying at the edges" feel overused, and emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constrained by length rather than deliberate; lacks a lingering impact or profound depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
