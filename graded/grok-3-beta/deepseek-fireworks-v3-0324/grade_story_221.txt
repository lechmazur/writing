<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to step out of her father’s shadow is clear, but the wreck-diver ghost whisperer trait feels underexplored in action and personality; her distinct voice is present but lacks depth in dialogue or inner monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the ghost’s revelation lacks sufficient buildup for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like broken glass and cotton candy scent, enhancing atmosphere; tone of fleeting rebellion complements the setting, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through grief and resolution, with strong symbolism in amber and thawing heart; ending is satisfying, but subtext is unevenly developed, and conflict resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like “thawing heart,” but some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like amber and carnival, leaving a lingering emotional note; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
