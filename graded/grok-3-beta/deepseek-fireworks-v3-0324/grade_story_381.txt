<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters are intriguing but underdeveloped; the necromancer's hushed nature and motivations are hinted at but lack depth, and Lira's personality feels secondary and utilitarian.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and escalation, but the resolution feels abrupt and incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven with rushed tension at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with strong sensory details like bioluminescent fungi and dripping water, enhancing the atmosphere; tone of futuristic nostalgia is well-integrated with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some tension, with effective imagery like "crystalline teeth," but lacks deeper emotional resonance or subtext; dialogue is functional but not particularly memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining necromancy with a modern cave exploration context, but reliance on familiar tropes of mysterious depths and reluctant partnerships; metaphors are occasionally fresh but not consistently striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the cave and resolve, but brevity limits depth; it leaves a lingering curiosity, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
