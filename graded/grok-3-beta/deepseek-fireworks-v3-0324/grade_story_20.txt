<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the archer’s internal conflict and motivation to chronicle social movements, but the anxiously calm attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently reflected in actions; lacks a distinct voice despite emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the turning point; the confrontation on the bridge drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall setting is vividly described and enhances the surreal atmosphere, complementing the tone of passionate disinterest; sensory details are effective, though the connection between setting and object feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a moderate emotional response through symbolism of the bridge and comb, with a satisfying ending; however, subtext is present but not deeply layered, and the central conflict resolves too neatly for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is mixed; metaphors like the inverted waterfall are fresh, but emotional handling occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; the narrative avoids clichés but lacks a truly unique style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the bridge of regret, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
