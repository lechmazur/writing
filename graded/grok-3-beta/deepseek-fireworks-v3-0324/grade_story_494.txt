<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arrogance and doubtful confidence are well-portrayed through his actions and internal conflict, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper nuance in motivation beyond pride and doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the shift from arrogance to humility is rushed, and the action of "authorizing" is conceptually vague in driving the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard is evocatively described, enhancing the mood of introspection, and sensory details like moonlight and ink are effective; however, the setting’s connection to the timeframe "between breaths" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its theme of unshackling potential, with strong symbolism in the tapestry and blade, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by overt telling of the swordsman’s feelings rather than showing through subtler actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on pride and transformation, some metaphors (e.g., “chains of pride”) feel overused, and the emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
