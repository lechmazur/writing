<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to push limits is clear, but the "lost heiress" identity feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in shaping her actions or voice; her reactions to the parking stub are symbolic but not revelatory of personal nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the unification attempts; cause and effect are logical, though the stub's role as a stabilizing key strains believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the xenobiology research station is vividly realized with strong sensory details like humming precision and bioluminescent flora, enhancing the fragmented reality concept; atmosphere supports the tone, though the cloud migration feels more decorative than integral at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the heiress's perseverance, with some effective imagery (horizon as question mark), but lacks deeper subtext or memorable uniqueness; ending is purposeful yet predictable, and dialogue feels functional rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like "bitter optimism," but relies on genre tropes of fractured realities without subversion; emotional resonance is present but surface-level, with some stated feelings rather than shown nuance; no glaring AI-like inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the stub as a key, but brevity seems more a limitation than a choice; it leaves a lingering question about the crack in the dome, though overall depth and style are competent rather than exceptional.</comment>
