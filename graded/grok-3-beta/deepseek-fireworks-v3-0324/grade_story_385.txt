<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Elias Morrow's portrayal as a pleasant meddler is somewhat evident, but his motivations lack depth and consistency; the transition to a more serious role feels abrupt and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between elements like footprints and symbols feels forced, and pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and beach setting create a striking atmosphere with effective sensory details, though the hospital ward timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the main action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has moments of evocative imagery and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced character reactions, and the ending feels more cryptic than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining elements, the metaphors (e.g., seeds, ice-thin boundary) are somewhat generic, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
