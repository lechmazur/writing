<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped; the "dutiful ward" lacks depth in backstory or emotional nuance, making their actions feel somewhat mechanical despite the jaded attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between voice notes and resolution could be more logically reinforced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is vividly rendered with sensory details like velvet drapes and marble walls, enhancing the atmosphere of confinement, though the timeframe of auditions feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes reflection on duty and freedom with strong symbolism (glove, sanctuary), but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional telling over showing, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of reframing the familiar offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "gilded cage") are clich√©d, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced depth, occasionally feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like voice notes, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
