<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lapsed priest's background and unapologetic confusion are intriguing, but his motivation feels vague and lacks depth; his actions are consistent but not revelatory of a distinct personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with jogging driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between snow patterns and fate are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and dull radiance create a striking, immersive atmosphere with evocative sensory details; the setting enhances the action, though its connection to the abacus feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through symbolism of the abacus and fate, with a satisfying ending, but lacks emotional depth and subtext; conflict is present but not sharply defined within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in imagery, metaphors like "ribs of some ancient beast" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is limited, and the tone occasionally shifts with overly ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about fate, but the style sometimes hinders clarity with dense language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
