<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the mercenary's longing for peace with the past, but the "shaky" attribute feels underexplored beyond a literal description, lacking deeper psychological nuance in actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the amber's sudden activation, undermining logical cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artistâ€™s haven is vividly rendered with sensory details like broken stained glass and neon graffiti, strongly supporting the tone of improbable longing and enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the mercenary's release of the past, and symbolism of the amber is effective, but dialogue feels slightly stilted and the theme of facing answers lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of amber as a bridge to the past is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of haunted soldiers without fresh subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking profound depth.</comment>
