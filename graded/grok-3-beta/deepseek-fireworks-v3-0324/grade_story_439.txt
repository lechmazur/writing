<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is limited; the mute courier's silence is intriguing but lacks depth in motivation beyond seeking hidden meanings, which feels vague and underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the comet’s guidance and interdimensional travel could be more logically grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly crafted with evocative sensory details of snow, decay, and celestial light, strongly enhancing the tone of cautious enchantment and supporting the setting’s role in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is notable with strong imagery and subtext about silence and escape, but the emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of a mute courier and interdimensional travel, but some metaphors (e.g., walls breathing) feel slightly overused, and emotional depth lacks nuanced human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it falls short of exceptional depth or lingering impact; the style supports clarity but doesn’t fully elevate the narrative to prestige level.</comment>
