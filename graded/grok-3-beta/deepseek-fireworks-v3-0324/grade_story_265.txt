<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the deputy’s impassivity is stated but not fully explored through nuanced actions or internal conflict, and motivation feels somewhat abstract without grounding in personal history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present but not strongly impactful, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with strong sensory details like the scent of fruit and motor oil, enhancing mood; the cathedral-orchard imagery effectively supports the tone, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a subtle emotional response through imagery and subtext, with effective use of symbolism (twist tie, bee); however, the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the central conflict remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique setting and concept, but some metaphors (e.g., “silent language of the lost”) feel overused; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally veers into ornate language that hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
