<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vale’s bafflement and pickpocket background are intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and inconsistent; the shift to poetry and transformation lacks grounding in his established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between Vale’s actions and the dummy’s influence feels forced; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the eerie tone, but the setting’s connection to Vale’s motivation and the dummy feels superficial at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and prompts thought about transformation, with some effective imagery, but the dialogue is stilted, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution; subtext is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, some metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance relies too much on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; the tone shifts slightly, undermining consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally obscures clarity; the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
