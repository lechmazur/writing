<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped; the cyber-templar’s collision with reality feels more symbolic than personal, lacking depth in emotional stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between proving something and reflecting lightning remains vague, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details like vulture shadows and storm imagery, effectively enhancing the sky burial site’s eerie tone, though setting-character motivation linkage could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through symbolism of storm and technology, with striking imagery, but lacks emotional depth and a fully satisfying resolution; conflict resolution feels more abstract than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in blending cyberpunk and mysticism, with fresh metaphors, but some phrases like “mirage of safety” feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering question of purpose, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
