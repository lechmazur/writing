<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to stand where fear dares not tread is intriguing but underdeveloped; the dog walker's personality lacks depth beyond a surface-level defiance, and her voice feels indistinct despite dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of justifying her presence is present but lacks a clear resolution, and pacing feels rushed toward the end with an abrupt shift to the orchids' reaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details like "loud silence" and rotting roses, effectively enhancing the haunted mansion setting and supporting the tone, though the timeframe's impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes tension and curiosity through imagery and subtext, but the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful; dialogue is purposeful but not entirely natural, and emotional depth is shown rather than told, yet lacks resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like "mansion’s hunger," but some phrases feel slightly ornate; emotional nuance is present but not fully convincing, and the narrative avoids major clichés yet lacks a truly surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; style supports clarity, yet the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, with lingering impact present but not profound.</comment>
