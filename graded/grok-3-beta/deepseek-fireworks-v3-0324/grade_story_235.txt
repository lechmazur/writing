<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the herbalist’s motivations are hinted at through her connection to the castle and meteors, but her personality feels underdeveloped and her voice indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between beginning and end is present but not strongly impactful within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative imagery of the castle ruins and meteor showers enhancing the mood; sensory details are present but could be more varied to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with effective symbolism (flowers, stars), but the emotional resonance is muted; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a stronger punch to linger with the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is middling; while the concept of decoding meteors is intriguing, some metaphors feel overused, and emotional handling leans toward stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it doesn’t fully reach the heights of publishable excellence due to restrained emotional depth and a style that occasionally overreaches with ornate language.</comment>
