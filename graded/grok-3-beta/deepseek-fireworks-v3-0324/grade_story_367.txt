<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to study tide patterns feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the herbalist’s craft; the "sapped" attribute is clear but lacks depth in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists with a subtle shift from despair to acceptance, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; connection between tide study and perfection concept is vague and lacks clear cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the glass-walled observatory is evocative and ties well to the ocean’s indifference, enhancing mood; sensory details like the tide’s hiss are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild reflection on perfection’s cost through imagery like the goose’s flight, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of exhaustion rather than showing nuanced struggle; ending feels purposeful yet underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in metaphor (bellows wheezing), but relies on predictable tropes of nature mirroring inner turmoil; emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown, risking generic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinct flair; lingering thought on imperfection is present but not profoundly impactful.</comment>
