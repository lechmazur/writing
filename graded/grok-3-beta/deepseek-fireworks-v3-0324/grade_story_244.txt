<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of guilt is clear but underdeveloped; the "reservedly bold" attribute feels inconsistently applied and lacks depth in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between mask and door are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the neon sign repair shop is evocative with strong sensory details like solder and ozone, enhancing mood, though timeframe integration feels symbolic but shallow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but reliance on familiar "haunted past" trope and generic descriptors for the void diminish uniqueness; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and depth beyond narrative is limited.</comment>
