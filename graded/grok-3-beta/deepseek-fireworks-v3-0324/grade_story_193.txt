<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the exiled prince's motivation to cure loneliness is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond generic melancholy, and his voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the snowstorm and the core action of improvement could be more organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a strong, evocative atmosphere of isolation that complements the tone of familiar unknown; sensory details like frost and howling wind are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of loneliness, and the mortar as a symbol of healing is a nice touch, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the conflict resolution lacks a deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar tropes of exiled royalty and chance encounters; metaphors like "loneliness as a wound" are somewhat clich√©d, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of the mortar and pestle, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a faint lingering feeling, though style and complexity don't fully elevate the narrative.</comment>
