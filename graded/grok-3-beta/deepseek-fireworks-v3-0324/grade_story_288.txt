<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to create timeless art is clear, but the "professionally wild" attribute feels underexplored in shaping personality or actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions to the flag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connection between action (quarantine) and plot momentum is weak and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting at the ozone monitoring station is intriguing but not meaningfully tied to the action or object; sensory details like ozone scent are present but lack depth to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the flag's symbolism, but subtext is surface-level; ending is purposeful yet lacks lasting impact; conflict is present but not sharply defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "rivers of fire" feel generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but some feel forced; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
