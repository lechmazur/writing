<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to feed curiosity is clear, but the social media exorcist lacks depth beyond a surface-level thrill-seeker persona; reactions to the receipt feel contrived rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the receipt and the haunting is underdeveloped, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked with sensory details like mildew and decay, enhancing the abandoned mess hall setting, but the timeframe of the final chord feels underutilized as a mood element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story shows potential with imagery and subtext around hidden truths, but emotional impact is muted by lack of character depth, and the ending feels more abrupt than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining social media with the supernatural, but reliance on familiar haunting tropes and generic descriptors like "quiet thrill" diminish uniqueness; metaphors are occasionally fresh but inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; lacks a lingering depth.</comment>
