<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's broke aristocrat status shapes his desperation, but his personality lacks depth beyond generic nobility-in-ruin tropes; motivation is clear but reactions feel predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the roller coaster visions are somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park setting is vividly described with strong sensory details (rotting cotton candy, creaking tracks), enhancing the eerie tone and supporting the legacy burden concept effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through legacy's weight, with decent symbolism (seed as choice), but dialogue feels stilted and ending lacks profound impact; conflict resolution is clear but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining haunted park with aristocratic legacy, but reliance on ghostly guide trope and predictable moral dilemma (plant or burn) dulls uniqueness; metaphors are occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the botanical illustration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
