<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The bard's romantic doom is implied but not deeply explored, limiting insight into his personality; motivation to preserve craft is clear but feels surface-level, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; while the concept of evading the spotlight drives the narrative, the resolution feels vague and pacing is uneven, with too much focus on introspection over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The utopia design studio setting is evocative and ties to the tone of forgotten revelry, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery, and the timeframe's integration feels more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (keys, bell echo) are strong, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling of the bard's ache; the ending lacks punch, and the central conflict remains too abstract for lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors (dust motes as dying stars) are fresh, the story leans on predictable melancholic tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the style feels slightly ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style borders on overwrought, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks the depth or innovation for a truly memorable impact.</comment>
