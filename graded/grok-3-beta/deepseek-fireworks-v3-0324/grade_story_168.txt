<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sylvie’s ruthlessness as a flower arranger is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to decode rock art feels clear but not deeply tied to her profession or personality beyond surface curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of distinguishing carvings driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between spontaneous road trips and the stone circle is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle is vividly rendered with sensory details and enhances the tone of polite anarchy; however, the timeframe of a singer’s pause feels more metaphorical than grounding, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity through its symbolism of the comb and stones, but emotional impact is limited; dialogue is purposeful yet lacks depth, and the central conflict feels understated for the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like the comb and stone circle, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptions verge on ornate, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with complexity; it leaves a lingering question about the stones, though depth feels constrained by the brevity.</comment>
