<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the morbid florist’s “neutrally passionate” attribute feels inconsistently applied, and her motivation to understand cosmic cycles is clear but not emotionally resonant. Her voice is indistinct, missing a unique perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution. The action of obliging and the concept of cosmic cycles drive the narrative, though cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is vividly realized and enhances the liminal atmosphere, complementing the tone and concept. Sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion; the setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes mild reflection on decay and cycles, with effective use of symbolism (candle, flowers). However, the emotional impact is muted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch. Subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by somewhat generic metaphors (candle as tears) and a predictable arc of seeking-to-knowing. While not formulaic, the emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown, lacking a truly distinctive style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication. The style supports clarity, yet the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
