<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Vex’s dedication to the shelter, but her personality as a "broke swashbuckler" feels underdeveloped; her actions lack the flair or recklessness expected from such a trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the marble-charting method, while creative, lacks sufficient buildup to feel fully coherent within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of a cyberpunk night market is vividly rendered with sensory details like neon lights and rain-slicked streets, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through Vex’s quiet sincerity at the end, and the central conflict is clear, but literary devices like symbolism are underutilized, and the theme of kindness feels surface-level without deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the cyberpunk setting and marble puzzle show originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of a lone hero saving the vulnerable without significant subversion; emotional resonance is present but stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length suits the tight arc, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, straightforward tale.</comment>
