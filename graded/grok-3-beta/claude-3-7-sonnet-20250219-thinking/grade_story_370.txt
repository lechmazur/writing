<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Martin's motivation to uncover hidden truths is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the inherited mission; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by Martin's covert actions, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story prompts curiosity about hidden realities and uses symbolism (the comic) effectively, but emotional resonance is understated, and the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the quantum exploration offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "pixelated reality") feel familiar, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with abstract language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
