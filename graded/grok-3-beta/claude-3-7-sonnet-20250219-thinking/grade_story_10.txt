<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marek's cheerless nature and fatal flaw of inability to forget are well-defined, but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuanced dialogue to fully flesh out his voice and motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the mutation concept's integration into the plot lacks deeper causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and server hum create a haunting atmosphere that complements the bittersweet tone, with effective sensory details like dusty windows, but the setting's connection to the chest and mutations feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marek's reckoning, with decent use of symbolism (maggots as renewal), but the theme of forgiveness feels heavy-handed, and the conflict resolution lacks subtlety, relying more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of mutated recipes is creative, the story leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion, and some metaphors (cleansing rain) feel generic; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the chest and recipes, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
