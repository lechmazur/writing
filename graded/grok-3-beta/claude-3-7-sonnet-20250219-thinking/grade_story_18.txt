<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gregor's tragically joyful attribute shapes his outlook effectively, and his motivation to escape the curse is clear, but his telepathy feels underutilized in driving personal conflict or depth beyond plot convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from isolation to reunion is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the action of weatherizing, while logical, lacks deeper narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like hissing valves, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness, though the setting's connection to the threadbare hair tie feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Gregor and Eliza's reunion, with subtle symbolism in the hair ties, but the ending, while satisfying, lacks a lingering punch; conflict resolution feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a living statue is unique, the narrative leans on familiar reunion tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like calligraphy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
