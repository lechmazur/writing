<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tom√°s's steady nature as a gravedigger is clear, and his motivation to preserve ritual practices aligns with his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the surface traits of diligence and whimsy. His voice is not distinct enough to stand out, and reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax. The connection between the overlapping worlds and the action of digging a channel is logical, though not fully developed due to brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Aztec temple setting is vividly described and enhances the story's mood, with sensory details like distant drums and whispered prayers adding immersion. However, the atmosphere could be further deepened with more varied sensory engagement beyond sound and sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of preservation, and the imagery of overlapping worlds is striking. However, the ending feels slightly underwhelming, lacking a stronger punch, and the dialogue is minimal and unremarkable. Subtext is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of overlapping worlds offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar mystical tropes without significant subversion. Metaphors like "yesterday and today embraced" are somewhat generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, though it limits depth. Creative thinking is evident in combining the magnifying glass and overlapping worlds, but the overall impact lacks the lingering resonance needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
