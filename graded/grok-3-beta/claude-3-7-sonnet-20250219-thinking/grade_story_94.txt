<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Viola's portrayal as a femme fatale heartbreak counselor is intriguing, with clear motivation tied to her past, but her internal conflict lacks deeper exploration within the word limit, making her transformation feel slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Viola's decision and the client's story could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sky reflection pool and futuristic timeframe are vividly rendered and enhance the mood of illusion and loss, though sensory details beyond visual imagery are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., amber earrings, reflection pool), but the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful, and the central conflict lacks sharp resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of time travel heartbreak is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "gravity of desires") feel slightly overused, and emotional depth relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is diminished by underdeveloped character depth.</comment>
