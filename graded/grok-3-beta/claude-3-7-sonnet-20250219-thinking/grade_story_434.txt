<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the action of outmaneuvering entities, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ghost story recording booth setting enhances the eerie atmosphere, and sensory details like frost on the microphone are evocative, though the timeframe's integration feels underexplored.</comment>
