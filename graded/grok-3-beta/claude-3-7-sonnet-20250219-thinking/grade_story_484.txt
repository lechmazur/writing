<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Malcolm's identity as a groggy brewer is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond surface-level dissent; his reactions to the mirror and staircase are telling but not revelatory of deeper character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of initiating a mechanism driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between protest and personal revolution is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting is evocatively described with sensory details like dust motes and yeast scents, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the protest timeframe feels somewhat disconnected from the mansion's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on personal values and revolution, with decent use of symbolism (mirror shard), but the emotional impact is muted, and the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying; dialogue is minimal but fitting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the brewing-revolution metaphor is somewhat original, the story leans on predictable tropes of hidden laboratories and transformation potions without subversion; sensory details are specific but not always fresh, and emotional nuance is lacking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but not distinctive, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
