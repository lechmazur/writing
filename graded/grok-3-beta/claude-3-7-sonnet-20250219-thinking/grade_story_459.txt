<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's dual role as an elevator technician and ghost-seeker is intriguing, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the emotional connection to his daughter drives him, yet his internal conflict lacks deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a poignant resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the ghost tours and elevator repair scenes are underdeveloped, causing minor coherence gaps within the tight word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a unique and evocative setting that enhances the story's melancholic tone, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus's grief and the ghostly encounter with his daughter, with subtle symbolism in the flower crown; however, the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the theme of letting go, while present, lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on grief and the supernatural, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptions (e.g., "resonant silence") verge on generic; emotional nuance is present but not consistently shown through action over statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering emotional impact; however, the style occasionally lacks the polish and depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
