<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aldric's cold nature as "Frost" is well-established, and his artistic awakening reveals a hidden depth, but his motivations shift too abruptly from duty to compassion without sufficient internal conflict or gradual transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of supporting others driving the story forward, but pacing feels unevenâ€”initial setup drags while the resolution feels rushed, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The deserted intersection at night sets a fittingly somber tone, and the basement gallery enhances the mood of grief, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the mitten and altars, and the theme of healing through connection emerges, but the impact is diluted by overt telling of emotions rather than showing, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a knight's artistic awakening is somewhat fresh, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of emotional transformation without subversion, and some descriptions (e.g., "bloodied snow") feel slightly overused or forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, leaving a lingering thought about human connection, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
