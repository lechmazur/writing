<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Karev's fiercely apathetic nature is well-portrayed and shapes his initial inaction, but his sudden shift to defiance feels slightly unearned without deeper internal conflict shown within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from resignation to decision is clear, but pacing feels rushed at the turning point; the connection between Tomas's resignation and Karev's action lacks sufficient causal depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is vividly realized and enhances the isolation theme, complemented by the meteor shower imagery; however, sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Karev's internal shift, with effective meteor symbolism, but the dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, lacks complexity for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique setting, some metaphors (e.g., "chains around his heart") feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a lingering sense of anticipation, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
