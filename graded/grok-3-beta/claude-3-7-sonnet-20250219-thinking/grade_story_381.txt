<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Lena's unique role as a futuristic necromancer, but her motivations lack depth beyond the mission; her personality feels somewhat surface-level despite the creative dialogue with spirits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between mapping and spiritual communion isn't fully fleshed out, leaving minor logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the futuristic yet nostalgic tone; however, the timeframe "between sets" feels underexplored and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response through Lena's reverence for the past, with effective imagery like cinema projectors, but the conflict is understated, and the theme of memory preservation lacks deeper subtext or impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story offers an original take on necromancy, but relies on predictable futuristic tropes without subversion; metaphors like "frozen memories" feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the profound depth or lingering impact required for top-tier publication; the style supports clarity but doesn't elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
