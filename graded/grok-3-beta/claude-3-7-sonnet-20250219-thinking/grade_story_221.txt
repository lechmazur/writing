<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's dual role as wreck-diver and ghost whisperer shapes her personality, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the rebellion is stated but lacks depth in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional shifts; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocative and enhances the ghostly atmosphere with strong sensory details, though the connection to the timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic emotional response and uses symbolism effectively (amber pendant), but the dialogue is sparse and subtext, while present, lacks sharpness; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining ghost whispering with a carnival setting, but some metaphors (e.g., "thawing heart") feel predictable; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not a profound one.</comment>
