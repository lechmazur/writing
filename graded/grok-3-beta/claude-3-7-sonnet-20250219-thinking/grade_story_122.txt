<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vexor's motivation to transcend reality through technology is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "patiently frantic" attribute, which feels surface-level and underexplored in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of proving a myth driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sky burial site enhances the eerie, transcendent atmosphere, and sensory details like storm clouds and lightning are evocative, though the setting's connection to the bridle feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of awe and loss, with strong imagery like fragmented lightning, but the ending feels more confusing than satisfying, and the theme of transcending reality lacks deeper subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique blend of cyberpunk and mysticism, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptions (e.g., "impossible colors") are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the prism and lightning, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
