<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mallory's motivation to find her daughter and map tunnels is clear, and her actions align with her role as a smuggler, but her personality lacks depth beyond the surface-level emotional drive; her voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the countdown and mapping action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and countdown timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like jasmine scent; however, the setting's connection to the object feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Mallory's hope and desperation, with effective imagery like the skeleton key warming, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in the tunnel-mapping concept, metaphors like "nature's compass" feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the countdown and key, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
