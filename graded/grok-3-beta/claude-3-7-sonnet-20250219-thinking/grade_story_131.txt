<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness as an orphan shapes her initial emotional distance, but her transformation feels slightly rushed; motivation to trust the unknown is clear but lacks deeper internal conflict to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the gravitational anomaly driving the narrative, but pacing feels unevenâ€”key emotional shifts are abrupt, and some cause-effect links are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized and enhances the story's mood, with sensory details like floating objects and whispers; however, the atmosphere's connection to Elara's motivation could be more consistently evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara's shift from fear to courage, with effective symbolism in the stones and gravity, but the ending feels more neat than impactful, lacking deeper subtext or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the gravitational anomaly offers originality, the emotional journey relies on familiar tropes of overcoming fear without fresh subversion; metaphors are functional but not striking, and some descriptions feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, but the style occasionally overexplains, hindering clarity; it leaves a mild lingering thought, though not profoundly memorable.</comment>
