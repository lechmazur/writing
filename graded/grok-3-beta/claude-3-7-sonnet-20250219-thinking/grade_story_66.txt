<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a deserter seeking belonging is clear, but Theo's personality lacks depth beyond his actions; his voice feels indistinct and reactions somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and mysterious end, but pacing feels uneven; the connection between puzzles, masks, and plant responses isn't fully logical or cohesive within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of a plant communication lab is evocative and enhances the story's mood of noble foolishness; sensory details are present but could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through Theo's longing; symbolism of masks and puzzles is effective, but the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying, lacking a stronger thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining plants and masks, but reliance on mystical transformation feels trope-heavy without subversion; metaphors are fresh at times but occasionally generic, lacking consistent individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering question, though not a deeply profound one.</comment>
