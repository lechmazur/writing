<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mei's portrayal as a morbid florist with neutral passion is intriguing, and her motivation to understand cosmic cycles aligns with her craft, but her internal transformation lacks depth due to limited emotional nuance or distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from invitation to enlightenment, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between action and resolution could be more impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is vividly described with evocative imagery of twilight skies and cherry petals, enhancing the mystical atmosphere, though sensory details beyond sight are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on life and death through strong symbolism (funeral arrangements mirroring supernovas), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist in a cosmic dojo is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "cosmic dance") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated shifts than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
