<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's ruthlessness and intellectual spontaneity are well-integrated into her dual life, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped—her drive to decode rock art lacks deeper personal stakes or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the stone circle investigation driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between flower arranging and archaeology remains more quirky than cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting and solstice concert timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like twilight and Serena’s haunting note, though the flower shop world feels underexplored by comparison.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts mild intrigue with its dual-life premise, and the ending is purposeful, but it lacks deeper emotional resonance or subtext; dialogue is functional but not particularly distinctive or layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original juxtaposition of flower arranging and archaeology, avoiding overt clichés, but some descriptors (e.g., “intellectual spontaneity”) feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact; the style is clear but not striking enough for top-tier publication without refinement.</comment>
