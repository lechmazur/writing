<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's alien identity and righteous flaws shape her internal conflict, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped due to limited exploration of her emotional depth within the word constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Mira's actions and the final resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Roman bathhouse setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like the organ's reverberations, enhancing the atmosphere, though the timeframe of concerts feels underutilized in mood-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mira's tenderness, with some effective symbolism in the tile, but the dialogue is sparse and the theme of trust feels surface-level rather than deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the alien-teacher premise offers originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of hidden knowledge without fully subverting them, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a strength, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped subtext.</comment>
