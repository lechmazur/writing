<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Elian's hopeful nature and motivation to save his sister are clear, but his "cleverly naive" attribute feels underexplored in shaping his actions; his personality lacks depth beyond determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of neutralizing the Machine driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of agonizing bliss, though the streetlamp's modernity feels jarring and disconnected from the timeless setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elian’s reunion with his sister, and imagery like the Machine’s collapse is striking, but the central conflict lacks nuanced tension, and the theme of regret feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of the Machine is unique, the narrative leans on fantasy tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions occasionally feel stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the jigsaw edge, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
