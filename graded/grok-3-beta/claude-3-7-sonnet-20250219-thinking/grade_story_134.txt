<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linden's obnoxiously polite attribute shapes her dialogue uniquely, but her motivation to track cultural evolution feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the awakening of the grove as a central conflict, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the laundry cycle's role in resolution seems convenient rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber is vividly described with sensory details like condensation and phosphorescent lights, enhancing the atmosphere, though the laundry cycle timeframe feels slightly gimmicky and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild dread and curiosity, with effective dialogue reflecting Linden's politeness, but lacks deeper subtext or a fully satisfying ending; tension is present but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of waking ancient spirits via salt crystals is original, the execution relies on familiar magical tropes without subversion, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like laundry cycles, but the style occasionally overexplains, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
