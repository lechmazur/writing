<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kenzo's arrogance and doubt are portrayed with some depth, particularly in his interaction with the tapestry fragment, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking a stronger internal conflict to fully flesh out his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from doubt to resolve, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard is evocative and supports the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen the atmosphere and immerse the reader fully in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kenzo's vulnerability, with effective symbolism in the tapestry and calligraphy, but the dialogue occasionally feels stilted, and the theme of redemption lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (e.g., "brittle as autumn leaves") feel overused, and emotional nuance is present but not consistently shown through action, relying at times on direct statements of feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a deliberate brevity, and the elements are generally in service of the narrative, but it lacks a truly lingering impact or profound depth that would elevate it to the highest literary standard.</comment>
