<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Garrett's portrayal as a focused collector shapes his meticulous nature and isolation, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a surface-level reaction to loss; his voice is distinct yet underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed in the final round, and some cause-effect links between game moves and personal revelations are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is vividly described with sensory details enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the connection between setting and Garrett's motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on solitude and despair with effective symbolism (black rose, game pieces), but dialogue occasionally feels stilted, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a game against despair is original, some metaphors (e.g., "museum exhibition of possibility") feel generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced subtext, leaning on explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting deeper exploration; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
