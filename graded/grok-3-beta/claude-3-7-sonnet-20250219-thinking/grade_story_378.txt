<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leonard’s grumpiness is endearing and consistent, shaping his interactions, but his motivation to save the orchard feels underdeveloped and reactive rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the beetle’s transformation lacks sufficient foreshadowing for coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance; it shows more than tells, yet dialogue feels functional rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the clockwork beetle offers originality, the narrative leans on predictable magical artifact tropes without subversion, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but lacks lingering impact or depth; the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
