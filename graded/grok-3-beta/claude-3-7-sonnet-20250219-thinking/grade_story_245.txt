<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Krez's motivation for revenge and vindication is clear, and his irate smuggler persona shapes his actions, but his emotional depth feels surface-level, lacking nuanced internal conflict beyond anger and betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with jogging and tea leaf reading driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between betrayal and hidden waterfalls lacks deeper causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like echoing voices and groaning structures, enhancing the tone of bitterness, though the connection between setting and the chopstick feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Krez's bitterness, with some effective symbolism in the tea leaves and chopstick, but the ending lacks a stronger punch, and the theme of rebuilding feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the tea leaf divination offers a unique angle, the smuggler's betrayal trope feels predictable without subversion, and emotional expression occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like tea leaves and jogging, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
