<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's first-person voice is distinct and carries a haunting, reflective tone, but the character's motivation to preserve tradition, while clear, lacks deeper personal stakes or complexity beyond the surface duty of guardianship. The "aggressively kind" attribute feels somewhat underexplored in action, missing nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of flinging the whistle driving a pivotal moment. Pacing is managed well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause and effect are logical, but the connection between the whale call and the whistle's transformation could be more explicitly grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room setting is vividly rendered with salt-streaked glass and creaking floorboards, enhancing the ghostly atmosphere and complementing the tone of brazen calm. Sensory details are evocative, though the connection between the setting and the plastic whistle feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of loss and renewal, with strong imagery like whale song and ancient dance patterns. The theme of forgotten wisdom is clear and layered, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by a lack of deeper character conflict. The ending is satisfying yet slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on tradition through the ghostly perspective, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "footprints in sand") feel overused. Emotional resonance is present but leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext. The style is distinct, though not entirely unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate brevity that suits the ghostly vignette, and the elements are generally in service of the narrative. It leaves a lingering thought about tradition's persistence, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
