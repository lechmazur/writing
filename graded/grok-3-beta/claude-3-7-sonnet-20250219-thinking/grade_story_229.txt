<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Professor Hadley's mild curiosity as an inventor shapes his persistence, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced complexity beyond the promise to Eliza.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the rain pattern method stretches believability without deeper grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The maritime graveyard setting enhances the eerie, melancholic atmosphere and ties well to temporal resonance; sensory details like rain pattering are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Emotional impact is present with Eliza's return, and imagery of rain as memory is striking, but dialogue feels slightly forced; subtext exists but lacks deeper thematic exploration within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Concept of rain as memory is original, but execution borders on clich√© with predictable emotional beats; metaphors are fresh yet occasionally over ornate, risking purple prose; emotional nuance is present but not fully shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering emotional note; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
