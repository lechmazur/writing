<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eugene's vigilant nature and orchardist background are well-integrated into his meticulous actions and motivations, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; grief is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the conspiracy unraveling, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the peacock feather method introduces a jarring, implausible leap in logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility setting is unique and ties to the plot, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere lacks depth to fully support the sardonic tone or Eugene's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eugene's loss, with some effective symbolism in paper airplanes, but the dialogue feels stilted, and the theme of patterns feels heavy-handed rather than subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, the conspiracy trope is predictable, and metaphors like "beetles in apple trees" feel generic; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced showing over telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the peacock feather method feels forced; it leaves a lingering thought of grief, though the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
