<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcos’ distraction as a guard shapes his personality, reflecting inner turmoil, but his motivation for reconciliation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance; dialogue reveals little distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; time displacement as a method is intriguing yet not fully logical within the story’s framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Infernal kitchen setting is vividly described with strong sensory details (brimstone scent, heat), enhancing atmosphere and supporting tone; however, timeframe integration feels slightly abstract and disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of regret and sacrifice, with effective symbolism (ribbon, hourglass); ending is purposeful but dialogue feels stiff and lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining infernal setting with time manipulation, but metaphors (e.g., “sliced through trust”) are somewhat clichéd; emotional handling shows nuance yet occasionally states feelings overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought on sacrifice; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
