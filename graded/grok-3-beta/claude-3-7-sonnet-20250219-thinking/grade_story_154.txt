<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brennan's "strongly weak" attribute is intriguing and shapes his role as a courier, but his motivation to track social changes feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in personal stakes beyond the delivery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the levitating ink driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a stronger causal link to Brennan's actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Celtic village is vividly described with sensory details like peat smoke and woad tattoos, enhancing the atmosphere, though the digital hub feels slightly disconnected from the ancient tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response with the theme of cultural loss, and the levitating ink imagery is striking, but the dialogue is minimal and lacks distinctiveness; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of magical ink revealing cultural decay is original, some descriptions (e.g., "jubilant despair") feel forced, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statement than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the ink pot and village setting, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped character depth.</comment>
