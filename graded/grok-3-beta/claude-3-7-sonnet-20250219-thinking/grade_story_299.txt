<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ella's uncertainty as a champion is clear, but her motivations and growth feel underdeveloped within the word limit; her voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue and internal reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between the developers' threat and the living exhibition response is logical yet lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chalk cliff artist colony setting is vividly described with sensory details like wind and mist, enhancing the mood of cheerful gloom; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly tied to the cultural stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Ella's struggle, with some effective imagery (chalk as love), but the dialogue feels slightly stilted and the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the brief format.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the metaphors (e.g., chalk as love) are somewhat predictable; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style is merely functional, not striking; the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
