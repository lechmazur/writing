<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marco's carefree gambler persona is intriguing but underdeveloped; his shift to gravitas feels abrupt without deeper insight into his internal conflict or past. Motivation is clear but lacks nuance in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the blueprint's impact on the plot overshadows other elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reverse engineering workshop is vividly described with sensory details like solder smell and dust motes, enhancing atmosphere, but the island memories feel underexplored as a setting element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marco's commitment to Eliza's vision, but literary devices like metaphors are sparse and subtext is surface-level; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of hidden blueprints and noble sacrifice without fresh subversion; sensory details are decent but not strikingly original, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinct flair, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
