<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Professor Wei's motivation to challenge societal norms is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the rational archetype; her internal conflict feels stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between snowflake patterns and neural stimulation is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arctic lighthouse setting and emotionless era create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like ice floes and snowflakes, though the orchard element feels slightly disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about humanity and emotion, with strong symbolism in snowflakes and the veil, but the emotional impact is muted by overt exposition rather than subtle showing of Wei's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of reawakening emotion is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable sci-fi tropes of emotionless societies without fully subverting them; metaphors like snowflake geometry are fresh but not wholly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like snowflakes and the veil, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
