<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical progression within the word limit, driven by the action of calcification, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility is vividly described and enhances the story's mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere could more strongly reflect the protagonist's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about freedom and control, with some symbolism in the stone tablets, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of 'showing' over 'telling' and a somewhat predictable resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of dream harvesting is original, but the narrative leans on familiar dystopian tropes without significant subversion; metaphors are functional but not striking, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering idea of resistance, yet lacks the polish for immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
