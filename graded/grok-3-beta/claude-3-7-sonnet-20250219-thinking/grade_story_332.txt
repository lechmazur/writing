<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ellis's solitary nature and artistic passion are well-defined, and her motivation to connect through the notepad feels consistent, but her inner conflict lacks deeper exploration, making her development feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between the notepad and the jasmine's revival could be more logically reinforced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered with sensory details like floating blooms and reinforced glass, enhancing the tone of isolation, though some atmospheric elements feel underutilized in supporting character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through the theme of connection across isolation, with effective imagery like celestial bodies orbiting, but the dialogue is minimal and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique setting and concept, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "leap of faith across the void") feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is more stated than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the notepad and garden, leaving a lingering sense of longing, but the style occasionally leans toward over-description, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
