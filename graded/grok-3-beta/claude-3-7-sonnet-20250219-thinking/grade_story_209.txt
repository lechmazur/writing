<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tanner's motivation to map railways as a connection to past happiness with Eleanor is poignant, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond this singular drive; his "artfully messy" attribute is mentioned but lacks depth in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the short-circuit incident adding tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between mapping railways and personal history is revealed too late to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and water tower settings are evocative and support the action, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere struggles to consistently reinforce the despairing cheer tone or Tanner's emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Tanner's confession and the hairbrush symbolism, with a satisfying ending, but it leans on telling over showing for emotional depth, and the central theme of honesty feels slightly forced rather than organically layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique premise with railway mapping, some emotional descriptors are predictable, and the narrative lacks a truly distinctive style or surprising twist, feeling somewhat formulaic in its resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the hairbrush and echo mapping, and it leaves a lingering emotional note, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
