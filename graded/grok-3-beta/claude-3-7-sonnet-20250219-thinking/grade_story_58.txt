<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's fierce loyalty and motivation to protect are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond duty; reactions to the journal and meditation feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete with a logical twist, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the radicalization action drives the story, though connections between elements can seem forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid, tense atmosphere; sensory details like moth wings on glass are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and prompts thought about loyalty, with effective imagery (moth percussion), but dialogue feels slightly stilted; the ending twist is satisfying yet lacks deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise is original with a unique twist on radicalization, but some metaphors (e.g., "inside storms") feel overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully shown through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about duty, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
