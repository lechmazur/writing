<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Everett's empathic nature is evident in his interaction with the spirits, but his motivations lack depth beyond the ritualistic act; his personality as a blacksmith feels underexplored in relation to his no-nonsense trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the solstice ritual providing structure, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between Everett’s actions and the spirits’ calming are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is vividly realized with strong sensory details like moonlight through cracked windows; the atmosphere supports the tone of preserved melancholy, though some sensory elements feel slightly repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through the theme of humanity’s lingering essence, with effective symbolism in the stained glass heart, but the dialogue feels slightly expository, and the conflict resolution lacks a sharper edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a post-human world is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., “cosmic dust”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated themes than nuanced subtext; the narrative style is distinct but not wholly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a lingering sense of humanity’s echo, and the brief length suits the vignette style, but the integration of elements occasionally feels forced, and the style lacks the polish for top-tier immediacy.</comment>
