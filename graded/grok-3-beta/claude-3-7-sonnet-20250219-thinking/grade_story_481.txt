<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eli's drive to reconnect with Sera and reclaim their past, but the portrayal lacks depth; Eli's personality feels more functional than distinct, and his voice is not uniquely compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links between corporate corruption and personal stakes are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital ward is vividly rendered with sensory details like the clang of the reconstruction lab, enhancing the atmosphere of loss and recovery, though the setting's connection to character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through shared memories, and imagery like the dragonfly is effective, but the central conflict feels understated, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and nostalgia, some metaphors (e.g., "limbic highways") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
