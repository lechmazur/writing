<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Margot's vendetta and creativity shape her actions convincingly, with her candy sculpting reflecting both precision and rage. However, her deeper emotional layers and voice remain underdeveloped, lacking nuanced dialogue or internal conflict beyond the surface motivation of resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and cohesive within the word limit, with the counterattack via candy driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is managed well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links between photographs and memory could be sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the rebellious atmosphere and complements the tone of scorn effectively. Sensory details, like sugar carving and market whispers, immerse the reader, though some descriptions lack specificity, missing opportunities for deeper atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Margot’s rediscovery of Lyria, with strong symbolism in the locket and sugar art. The theme of memory and resistance is clear, but subtext feels somewhat surface-level, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining candy sculpting with rebellion, avoiding overt clichés. However, some metaphors (e.g., “fury of a storm”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the locket and photographs, leaving a lingering question about memory and identity. Yet, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
