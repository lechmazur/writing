<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a rebel preserving heritage is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype; her voice, while distinct, feels somewhat predictable for the role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the supernatural elements lack grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted passage setting is vividly described with sensory details like damp stones and whispers, enhancing the atmosphere of dread and mystery; however, the connection between setting and timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Maya's determination, with some effective imagery and subtext about heritage, but the ending feels more functional than impactful; dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on familiar tropes of haunted spaces and lone rebels without significant subversion; metaphors are serviceable but not striking, and emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the sticky note and passage, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about preservation, though not profoundly so.</comment>
