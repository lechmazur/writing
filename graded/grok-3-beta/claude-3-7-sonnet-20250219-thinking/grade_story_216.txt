<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vex's role as a professional scapegoat is intriguing and shapes his actions, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the transition from indifference to obsession lacks depth or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the washer driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between decoding and identity restoration isn't fully logical or earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Cloud City setting is vividly imagined and enhances the tone of isolation, with sensory details like "cirrus wisps" adding atmosphere, though the ground-level sanctuary feels tacked on and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with the washer's symbolism and Vex's redemption, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of subtext or deeper conflict; the ending is purposeful but not wholly satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a professional scapegoat is original, and metaphors like the washer as identity are fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the washer and Cloud City, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
