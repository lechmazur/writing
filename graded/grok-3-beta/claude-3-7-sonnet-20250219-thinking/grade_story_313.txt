<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Milo's portrayal as a con artist with remorse is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; the transition from guilt to action feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between remorse and the ghostly interrogation method is not fully logical or seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the harsh sun and buzzing drones, effectively supporting the oppressive atmosphere and Milo's motivation, though the silo's supernatural element feels slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Milo's guilt, but the ending lacks punch; dialogue with ghosts is purposeful but not entirely natural, and subtext is present but not deeply layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on familiar dystopian tropes without significant subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the writing lacks a truly distinctive style or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it leaves a lingering thought of atonement, though the style and brevity hinder deeper resonance.</comment>
