<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elena's motivation tied to grief and her role as a "rash protector" feels underexplored and somewhat forced, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the cosmic revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the beginning and cosmic ending is somewhat abrupt, lacking seamless cause-effect integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and howling caverns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the mystical tone and enhances the action, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sound and sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective response with a satisfying ending and effective symbolism of the cosmos, but lacks deeper subtext or a strong central conflict; emotions are shown rather than told, yet dialogue is absent, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the cosmic postcards offer an original angle, the narrative leans on predictable mystical discovery tropes without subversion; metaphors are fresh but emotions lack nuanced handling, feeling somewhat stated rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
