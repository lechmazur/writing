<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's background as a feisty stablehand is intriguing, but her transition to a sculptor feels underdeveloped; motivation to preserve ancient methods is clear but lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tickets and morphing debris feels abrupt and underexplained; pacing is uneven with rushed climactic moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The space debris studio setting is vividly realized and enhances the story's tone of quiet boldness; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Mira's redemption, with some effective symbolism (phoenix); however, the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of morphing debris is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable redemption tropes; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the lamp and tickets; however, the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the impact is not fully lingering.</comment>
