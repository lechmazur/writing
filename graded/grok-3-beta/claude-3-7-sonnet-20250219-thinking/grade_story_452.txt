<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the action of stabilizing reality driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between nightly repairs and broader impacts lacks depth within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting and post-storytelling timeframe are vividly rendered with sensory details like neon corridors and humming projectors, enhancing the atmosphere of muted euphoria, though some connections between setting and character motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through themes of lost humanity and restoration, with effective symbolism in the buckle, but the ending lacks a powerful punch, and subtext is present yet not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
