<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Miranda's background as a lost heiress and her bitterly optimistic attribute shape her determination, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper emotional nuance in her reactions to the parking stub.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the action of unifying fragmented realities driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the detour method, while logical, lacks deeper integration into the story's tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station and cloud migration timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, with strong sensory details of prismatic shadows, though the connection between setting and the parking stub feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Miranda's triumph, with effective imagery like "droplets of mercury," but the central conflict resolution feels somewhat predictable, and subtext remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fragmented realities offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without significant subversion, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
