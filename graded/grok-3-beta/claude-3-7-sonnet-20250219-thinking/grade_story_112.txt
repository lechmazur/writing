<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and ties to personal history, but the "factually imaginative" attribute feels underexplored in shaping distinct personality or voice; reactions to the handkerchief and hopscotch board reveal depth, though inconsistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from aimlessness to purpose is coherent within word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; connection between decoding patterns and preserving recipes drives the story logically, though some cause-effect links lack depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the writing system archive enhances the theme of lost knowledge, and sensory details like snowflakes and dusty floors create immersive atmosphere; tone of mournful elation aligns well with setting, though some details feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through themes of loss and recovery, with effective symbolism (snowflake, handkerchief); ending is satisfying, but subtext on cultural erasure could be deeper; conflict is present but resolution feels slightly pat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality in decoding recipes via hopscotch board is notable, but some metaphors (embers, frost patterns) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown; tone is consistent, though not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative; style supports clarity but lacks distinct flair; brief length feels deliberate, though depth is somewhat sacrificed; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
