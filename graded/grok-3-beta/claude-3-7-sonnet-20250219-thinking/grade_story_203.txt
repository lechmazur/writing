<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kell’s stage fright and role as an exorcist are well-integrated into his internal conflict, but his motivations feel slightly underdeveloped due to limited exploration of personal stakes beyond inherited lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and reflective end, but pacing feels rushed in the middle, and the flickering lights as a climactic moment lack sufficient buildup or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story’s atmosphere of desolation and renewal, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in zero-gravity life.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes empathy through Kell’s struggle and Rey’s grief, with subtle symbolism in the wildflowers and key, but the ending’s ambiguity feels more inconclusive than purposeful, diluting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a space exorcist offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar grief tropes without fully subverting them, and some descriptions (e.g., “glittering belt of debris”) feel slightly generic rather than uniquely vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting depth; it leaves a lingering question about truth, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
