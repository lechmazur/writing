<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nara's motivation as a time refugee is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "trustworthy strange" attribute, which feels surface-level and underexplored in her interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the catapult action, while creative, strains believability within the story's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of alienation, complemented by sensory details like the hum of the core; however, the timeframe's poetic phrasing feels slightly disconnected from the narrative's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of longing and hope, with effective symbolism in the tablecloth and capsules, but the dialogue is minimal and lacks distinctiveness, and the emotional impact is somewhat diminished by overt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a time refugee and temporal anchors is original, some metaphors (e.g., "sea of time") feel overused, and the narrative occasionally relies on stated emotions rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and overall impact.</comment>
