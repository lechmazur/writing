<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tomas's overzealous nature as a park ranger is evident and shapes his meticulous patrols, but his deeper motivations lack nuance beyond a generic duty to his grandmother's legacy; his voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped in emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and mysterious end, but pacing feels unevenâ€”key revelations are rushed, and cause-effect links between encounters and goddess echoes are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a highway overpass is vividly realized and complements the post-dream timeframe, enhancing the eerie tone; sensory details like whispering trees are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its goddess concept and has strong imagery, like shifting light, but the emotional impact is muted by overt exposition; the ending is intriguing yet lacks a fully satisfying resolution; dialogue feels purposeful but stiff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise of a post-dream world is original, the execution leans on familiar mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with over-elaborate phrasing; it leaves a lingering question about the goddess, though depth feels surface-level.</comment>
