<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jensen's motivation as a subdued vigilante seeking justice is clear, and the wooden bead ties into his past trauma effectively, but his personality lacks depth beyond the surface-level duality of day job versus secret mission. His voice in dialogue feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (setup), middle (tension via mirror distortions), and end (decision to act), but pacing feels uneven—too much focus on mirror-watching slows momentum. Cause and effect are logical, though the connection between flattery and plot progression is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and screaming silence tone create a haunting atmosphere that complements the price of war concept. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used (dust, silence). The setting enhances Jensen’s isolation, though more vivid immersion could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet melancholy and uses symbolism (bead, mirror) well, but the emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing. The ending is purposeful, yet not fully satisfying. Dialogue is natural but unremarkable. Subtext around war’s cost is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of Mirror Walking is original, and the subdued vigilante angle avoids overt clichés, but the narrative leans on familiar war-trauma tropes without subversion. Emotional handling is more stated than nuanced. Writing style is clear but lacks a unique voice; some metaphors feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with most elements integrated thoughtfully, though the virtual call timeframe feels slightly forced. Creative thinking is evident in Mirror Walking, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice. It leaves a lingering thought about war’s cost, but impact is moderate.</comment>
