<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finley’s transformation from a baffled pickpocket to a poet is intriguing, but her motivations lack depth; the shift feels abrupt without sufficient internal conflict or backstory to ground her evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed, especially in the transition from theft to poetry, undermining the logical flow of her transformation within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with sensory details like spectral cold and rusted warmth, enhancing the eerie tone, though the connection between setting and dummy feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on rebellion and transformation with strong imagery, but the dialogue feels stilted at times, and the central conflict resolves too neatly, lacking lingering tension or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of poetry as transformation is original, some metaphors (e.g., “jaws of mundanity”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
