<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elliot's nostalgia and obsession with parallel lives are clear, but his motivations lack deeper emotional grounding; his actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than nuanced personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between sewing coordinates and dimensional travel is underdeveloped, straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck and storm atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the mood, though the setting's connection to Elliot's tailoring feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and some tension, with effective imagery like the mirror's ripple, but the ending lacks emotional weight, and dialogue feels expository rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel lives via a mirror is intriguing, the execution leans on familiar multiverse tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like "stitches across the cosmos" feel slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like sewing and storms, but it lacks the profound depth or lingering impact needed for top-tier publication; style is clear but not distinctive.</comment>
