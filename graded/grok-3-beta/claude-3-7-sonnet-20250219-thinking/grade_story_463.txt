<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is evident and shapes his personality, but his deeper motivations remain somewhat opaque beyond managing ghosts. His interaction with the rope and ghost reveals a pragmatic yet haunted nature, though his voice could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by the sentinel's actions, with a clear arc from crossing off names to negotiating with the ghost. Pacing is well-managed within the word limit, though the connection between beginning and end feels slightly understated, missing a stronger emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom setting is vividly realized and enhances the ghostly interactions, with sensory details like the creaking floorboards and cold fingers adding immersion. The atmosphere strongly supports the tone and motivation, though some sensory elements could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism (the rope, names on the wall) effectively. The dance as a negotiation device is memorable, and the ending is purposeful, though the central conflict feels slightly understated. Subtext is present but could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story offers originality in the dance negotiation with a ghost, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "waves scraping against the rocky shore") feel familiar. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, yet the overall style lacks a fully unique voice, risking a generic tone at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the dance and ghostly lessons. The brief length works as a deliberate choice, leaving a lingering question about the rope. However, the style occasionally lacks the polish needed for top-tier clarity and impact.</comment>
