<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seer’s analytically innovative attribute shapes her actions somewhat, but her personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation for justice is clear but not deeply personal or nuanced, missing a distinct voice or emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is driven by untangling delayed justice with a clear arc within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained, but the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and timeframe post-party create a unique atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like petrichor; however, the setting’s connection to the USB drive feels slightly underutilized, missing deeper symbolic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through the theme of justice, with some effective imagery (technological snow), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is purposeful but not striking, and conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements like petrichor and decryption, but sensory details are occasionally generic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered, and the narrative style feels competent rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; the style supports clarity, though the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
