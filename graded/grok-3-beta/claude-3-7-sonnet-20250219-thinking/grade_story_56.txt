<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maxwell's "energetically lethargic" trait is intriguing but inconsistently reflected in his actions; his motivation to expose truth feels sudden and underdeveloped for a swindler, lacking depth in internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the ghostly intervention and Maxwell's schemes lacks sufficient buildup within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard in a skyscraper is vividly realized with strong sensory detail, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and renewal; however, the timeframe of the computer restart feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about hidden truths, with some effective imagery like the blank price tag as a symbol; yet, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict's resolution lacks emotional punch within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of ghostly allies and the orchard setting offer originality, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable swindler tropes without subversion; metaphors are fresh, though emotional nuance is sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering question about truth, yet overall impact is diminished by uneven character depth.</comment>
