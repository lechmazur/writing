<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's background as a former child star and her authentically odd nature are well-integrated into her motivations and actions, but her emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level, lacking nuanced internal conflict beyond ambition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and transformative end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the map and the cathedral window's role is not fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber and cathedral window create a unique atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like light patterns and harmonic resonance, though the setting's connection to Maya's personal stakes could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and some emotional response through Maya's transformation, with effective imagery like light through stained glass, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the theme of ambition's cost lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of frequencies in cathedral glass is original, some metaphors (e.g., mind fracturing like stained glass) feel predictable, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit description than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength, limiting depth.</comment>
