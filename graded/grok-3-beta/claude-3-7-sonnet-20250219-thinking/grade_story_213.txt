<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation to protect and advance the prototype is clear and tied to her dutiful nature, but her personality lacks depth beyond the scientific obsession; her reaction to the hair clip is sentimental but not revelatory enough to enrich her character significantly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the prototype's activation; the connection between the wedding and lab crisis is logical yet underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lab setting enhances the scientific stakes and complements the concept of artificial photosynthesis, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen the atmosphere; the wedding setting feels secondary and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with the miniature sun imagery, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions; dialogue is functional but lacks distinctiveness; the theme of persistence is present yet not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a miniature sunrise is intriguing, the story leans on predictable scientist tropes without subversion; metaphors like "artificial dawn" are evocative but not entirely fresh; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength; there is creative intent, but the impact is muted by underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
