<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elliott's repression and lingering doubts are clear motivators, but his transformation into cosmic authority feels abrupt and lacks depth in emotional nuance; his voice, while distinct, doesn't fully evolve with his newfound power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the ambush and cosmic transformation feel rushed and somewhat disconnected from the initial exploration; pacing is uneven with a sudden shift to the supernatural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The overgrown city setting is vividly described and enhances the mood of rediscovery, with strong sensory details like wild roses and wisteria; however, the atmosphere doesn't fully align with the cosmic shift, diluting its impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through imagery of glowing verses, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is surface-level; literary devices like metaphors are present but occasionally overdone, and subtext feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of poetry on skin is unique, the story leans on familiar tropes of magical artifacts and sudden empowerment without subversion; some metaphors feel generic, and emotional handling lacks nuanced showing over telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering idea of art's power, though depth is limited by rushed resolution.</comment>
