<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Vikram’s dual identity as a city planner and doomsday prepper, but his motivations lack depth and nuance; the shift from fear to transformation feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution; the connection between studying constellations and personal transformation isn’t fully logical or earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is vividly rendered and complements the celestial theme, enhancing atmosphere; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the temple and constellations, but the emotional resonance is weakened by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the blend of urban planning and ancient astronomy, but the narrative leans on predictable transformation tropes without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but it lacks the depth and polish for top-tier publication; the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
