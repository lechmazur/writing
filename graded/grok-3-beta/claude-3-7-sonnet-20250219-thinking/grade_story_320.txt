<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's shyness as a diviner is present but underdeveloped; her motivation to restore balance feels clear but lacks depth in emotional grounding, making her actions seem somewhat mechanical despite alignment with her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of precipitating a cosmic fracture driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and some cause-effect links are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater city market setting is vividly imagined with sensory details like phosphorescent coral, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mira's sacrifice, with some effective imagery and subtext about regret, but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of timelines and regret offers originality, the execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of sacrifice, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
