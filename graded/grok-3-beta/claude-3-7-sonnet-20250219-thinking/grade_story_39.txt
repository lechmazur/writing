<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's restlessness and deceptive nature are clear, shaping her secretive plotting, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Mira's covert mission, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between her stitching and the grand plan lacks clarity, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Martian biodome setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like filtered air and artificial light, enhancing the atmosphere of confinement, though the tone occasionally wavers between hope and desolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet rebellion and uses symbolism (lantern as hope), but the emotional impact is muted by surface-level conflict resolution and a lack of deeper subtext within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a tailor plotting escape is fresh, some descriptions (e.g., "crimson prison") feel clich√©d, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the lantern and biodome, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
