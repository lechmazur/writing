<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's blank-faced nature is intriguing but lacks depth in motivation; the drive to learn the language of dreams feels abstract and underexplored within the short format.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the release of rumors, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between celestial tracking and rumor approval is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the orchard and waterfalls is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the ethereal tone, though the piano practice timeframe feels slightly disconnected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., "liquid silver") are overused, and the precise madness tone occasionally veers into overly ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped character motives, leaving the impact somewhat superficial.</comment>
