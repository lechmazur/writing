<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Viktor's portrayal as a docile bruiser with a disturbingly calm demeanor is intriguing and shapes his gentle interactions with the plants, but his motivation to mold a myth feels underdeveloped and slightly inconsistent with his initial quest to raise the dead.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the twist of the baton's true purpose driving a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the drum solos and narrative progression is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth setting is vividly realized with man-eating plants and drum solos enhancing the eerie atmosphere, complemented by sensory details like snapping vines and glass corridors; however, the timeframe's integration feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Viktor's grief and transformation, with strong imagery and symbolism in the baton and plants, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of communication lacks deeper subtext or complexity to truly resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on language barriers with plants, some metaphors (e.g., "hands like sledgehammers") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the baton and greenhouse, leaving a lingering emotional note, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
