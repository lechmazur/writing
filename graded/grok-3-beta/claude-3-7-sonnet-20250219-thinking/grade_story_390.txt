<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like jasmine scent, enhancing the atmosphere of intrigue, though the timeframe's urgency could be more palpably integrated into the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue through subtext about truth and deception, with effective symbolism in the butterfly pattern, but the emotional impact is muted, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow.</comment>
