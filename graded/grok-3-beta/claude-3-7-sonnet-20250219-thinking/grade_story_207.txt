<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Taro's forthright nature and meekly assertive attribute are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to break the oath is clear, yet his internal conflict lacks depth, making his personality feel somewhat flat despite a distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot is driven by the action of dividing information, which fits logically, and the story achieves a complete arc within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned space station medical bay and cosmic timeframe are evocatively paired, enhancing the tone of joyful loneliness; sensory details like cosmic radiation pinging are effective, though more varied sensory immersion could elevate the atmosphere further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Taro's dilemma, with some symbolism in the flowers, but the impact is diminished by limited subtext and a resolution that feels more functional than profound; dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining elements like gossip columns and genetic experimentation, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question, and the style, while clear, doesn't fully elevate the material to a standout level.</comment>
