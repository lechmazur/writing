<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mortimer's grumpiness and role as a crypt caretaker are well-established, and his motivation to find peace is clear, but his emotional transformation lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice, feeling somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of jiggling the tube fitting logically, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are surface-level rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the tone and concept of trauma, though sensory details could be more specific to heighten the mood further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mortimer's release of pain and uses symbolism effectively with the mandala, but the theme of trauma's transformative power lacks deeper subtext, and the ending feels slightly pat rather than profoundly satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in the mandala ritual, the emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable healing arc without a truly surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mandala and tube, but the style occasionally leans on overt exposition, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
