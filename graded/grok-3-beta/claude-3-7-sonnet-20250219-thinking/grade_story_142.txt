<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation to reclaim family legacy through secret recipes is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the trope of a fallen aristocrat; reactions and actions align with motive but lack a distinct voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with a clear arc from discovery to resolution within word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are coherent, but the supernatural elements introduce minor inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the haunted amusement park enhances the eerie tone and supports the concept of legacy; vivid sensory details like "faded colors vivid against gray sky" immerse effectively, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through legacy's weight, with decent imagery and symbolism; ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying; conflict is present but resolution lacks depth; theme of legacy emerges but lacks profound subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s but leans on predictable aristocratic decline trope without subversion; metaphors like "fever dream" are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown; style is individual but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of narrative; style supports clarity but lacks exceptional flair; brief length feels deliberate, though depth is sacrificed; leaves a lingering thought of dual futures, but impact is moderate.</comment>
