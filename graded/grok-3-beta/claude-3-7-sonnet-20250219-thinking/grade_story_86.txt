<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zara's apprehension is clear and shapes her actions, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit; motivation is present but lacks nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical flow with the data extraction driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center is vividly rendered with sensory details like neon monoliths and humming servers, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and candle feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of truth versus lies, and imagery like "borrowed dawn" is striking, but the ending feels abrupt, and subtext is underdeveloped for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a candle as a data key is original, some metaphors like "neon monoliths" feel familiar; emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing, missing nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the candle, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering idea of truth, yet lacks profound depth for a top-tier journal.</comment>
