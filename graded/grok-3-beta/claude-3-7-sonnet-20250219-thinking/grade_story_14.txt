<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's naivety as a gambler is evident, but his transformation lacks depth; motivation shifts from gambling to belonging without sufficient internal conflict or nuanced progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the connection between candle-making and personal growth is underdeveloped, and some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like waves and candlelight, enhancing the isolated atmosphere; however, the timeframe of candlelit dinners occasionally feels forced into the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's realization of belonging, with some effective symbolism in candles; yet, the dialogue feels overly theatrical at times, and the central conflict remains subtle to a fault.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (e.g., "bargain with darkness") feel generic; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking the nuance expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like candles and lectures, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly memorable one.</comment>
