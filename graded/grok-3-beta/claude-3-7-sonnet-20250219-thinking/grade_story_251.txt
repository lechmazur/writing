<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Merina's ambivalence as a prophet is intriguing, but her motivations feel underdeveloped; the sacrifice at the end lacks deeper emotional grounding or prior hints of such selflessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, especially the transition to her fatal decision, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is vividly rendered and enhances the isolation of Merina's role, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen the atmosphere of confinement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sadness through Merina's sacrifice, and symbolism of marbles is effective, but the ending feels slightly predictable, lacking a sharper emotional or thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of healing marbles with puzzle pieces is inventive, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes of prophecy and sacrifice without fully subverting them; emotional nuance is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like marbles and puzzles, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
