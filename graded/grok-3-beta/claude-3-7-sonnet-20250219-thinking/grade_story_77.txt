<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra's introversion and empathic abilities are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, particularly in her secret resistance work, but her inner voice lacks distinctiveness, and her emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level despite the potential for richer exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between reassembling the marionette and the broader resistance narrative isn't fully fleshed out, leaving some cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout setting is vividly described and enhances the sense of isolation and secrecy, complementing Lyra's motivation; however, sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere could be deepened to better reflect the tone of drowsy enthusiasm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Lyra's quiet rebellion and has subtle subtext about outcasts, but the symbolism of the marionette feels heavy-handed, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly memorable impact or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise with the underground railroad in space, some metaphors (e.g., starfish as possibilities) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans toward over-explanation, hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
