<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eira's guarded nature as a minstrel is evident in her selective sharing of ballads, and her motivation to recover extinct crafts is clear, but her personality lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice beyond her role in the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with decryption driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the bookmark and broader resistance are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vividly described with luminescent trees and data hums, enhancing the atmosphere of secrecy and resistance, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eira's determination, with some effective imagery like "emerald shadows," but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of decrypting vows offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar dystopian tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, if unremarkable, narrative.</comment>
