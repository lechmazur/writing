<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's development as a late-blooming hero is evident, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the transition from grief to purpose lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the connection between star mapping and survival is logical yet introduced too abruptly to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like toxic mudflats, enhancing the atmosphere of loss, though the timeframe's integration feels more poetic than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reluctant awe and offers subtext about balance, but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic balance is original, some metaphors (e.g., "transform loss into light") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced depth in key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the spyglass, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
