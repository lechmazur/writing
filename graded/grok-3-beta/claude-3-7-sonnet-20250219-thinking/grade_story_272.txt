<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's social awkwardness is evident in his avoidance of eye contact and minimal dialogue, but his motivation to undo past mistakes feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance; his personality doesn't distinctly shape his use of the whistle beyond functionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of reclaiming his creation driving the narrative forward logically; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The late-shift diner setting effectively complements the secretive tone and enhances the encrypted archive concept with vivid fluorescent light and coffee pot details; yet, sensory immersion is inconsistent, missing deeper tactile or olfactory elements to fully ground the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its concept of hidden truths, and the ending offers a purposeful resolution; however, dialogue feels utilitarian, literary devices like the "tree of regret" metaphor are somewhat heavy-handed, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The integration of cryptography and a whistle as a decryption tool offers originality, avoiding overt clich√©s; still, some descriptors are generic, emotional handling lacks subtlety, and the narrative tone wavers slightly, missing a fully distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact, and the style occasionally prioritizes concept over clarity, diminishing overall resonance.</comment>
