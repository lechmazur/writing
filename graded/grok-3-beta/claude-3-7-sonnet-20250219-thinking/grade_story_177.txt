<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marielle's rebellious nature is clear and drives her unique role as a writer of living obituaries, but her deeper emotional layers and personal stakes remain underdeveloped, limiting the depth of her character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of manifesting an obituary driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links between the revolution whispers and Marielle’s actions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is vividly realized and enhances the story’s atmosphere of hidden truths, with strong sensory details like trembling books; however, the tone of lucid frenzy could be more consistently evoked through sharper contrasts in mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its exploration of truth and revision, with effective symbolism in the bookshelf and obituary, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper character connection, and the ending feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its surreal premise and fresh metaphors like "break the spine of fate," avoiding overt clichés, but some descriptions (e.g., "shimmering tableau") lean toward generic, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the bookshelf and mask, leaving a lingering question about personal truth, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
