<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eliana's impulsiveness and whimsical nature are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to right a historical wrong feels vague and lacks specificity, failing to deeply connect with her actions or the music sheet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of tackling the mystery feels loosely defined, and the method of tracking shooting stars is intriguing yet poorly integrated into a coherent narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, but the connection between the setting and the emotional inheritance concept feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style often hinders clarity with excessive elaboration; it leaves a faint lingering thought, though not enough to suggest significant depth.</comment>
