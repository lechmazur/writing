<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Malik's tension as a bodyguard is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to break free feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice, lacking depth in personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Malik's journey toward emancipation, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between collecting stories and freedom is tenuous and lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is evocative and complements the rebirth concept with strong visual imagery, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports Malik's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the story attempts symbolism with the photograph and rebirth, it lacks emotional resonance due to heavy reliance on telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying, and tension is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative leans on repetitive phrases like "serene anger" and overused metaphors, lacking originality; emotions are often stated rather than nuanced, and the style feels formulaic with little unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
