<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Mr. Thornwood's vigilance and sardonic nature are present, but his motivation to overcome personal tragedy feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional portrayal; his actions align with traits, but his voice and reactions remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with conspiracy unraveling as a driver, but pacing feels rushed, and connections between actions and outcomes are often vague or forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility setting is intriguing but underutilized for atmosphere; sensory details are sparse, and the tone of sardonic glee clashes inconsistently with the setting's potential for whimsy or tension.</comment>
