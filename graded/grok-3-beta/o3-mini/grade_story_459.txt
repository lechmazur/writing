<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; while the concept of silence drives some tension, the narrative feels fragmented with no clear resolution, and pacing is uneven with rushed spectral encounters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is intriguing and ties to the tone of complex simplicity, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the ghostly or mechanical elements of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through themes of liberation and acceptance, but it often tells rather than shows emotions, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a visceral emotional punch or memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the execution relies on predictable ghost story tropes without subversion, and the language occasionally veers into overly ornate prose, diminishing authenticity and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often obscures clarity with overwrought phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, lacking lasting resonance.</comment>
