<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's "methodically chaotic" nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to master silence feels abstract and lacks grounding in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with resistance as a central action, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between hijacking messages and mastering silence is tenuous and unclear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on ornate language and generic descriptors like "crushing tides," risking purple prose; lacks fresh metaphors and shows predictable rebellion tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with creative elements, but style often obscures clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and impact is muted by abstraction.</comment>
