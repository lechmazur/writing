<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Liwei's stubbornness is implied but not deeply explored; motivation to outsmart his dark reflection feels abstract and lacks grounding in specific actions or backstory, resulting in a character who feels more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; the action of avenging through analyzing tooth marks is intriguing but underdeveloped within the word limit, leading to rushed pacing and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the aerial gondola over mountains is vividly described and enhances the tone of cautious enchantment; sensory details are present but sometimes generic, missing deeper atmospheric immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through self-forgiveness and redemption, with some effective imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels more stated than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows potential for originality with the concept of harvesting the past, but relies on overused metaphors and ornate language that borders on purple prose, lacking authentic emotional nuance and feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overly complex phrasing; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, missing a lingering impact.</comment>
