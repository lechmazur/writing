<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels meandering; the road trip as a method lacks clear causality or urgency, and pacing is uneven with overly dense introspection disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the reimagined Mesopotamian temple is evocative and ties to the tone of dull radiance, but sensory details are sparse and atmosphere often feels overwritten rather than immersive.</comment>
