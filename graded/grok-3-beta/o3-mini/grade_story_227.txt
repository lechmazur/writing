<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Riven's underdog status and motivation to decode dream symbols are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond generic determination and self-doubt; reactions to the brass microscope feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The subtle uprising drives the plot, but the narrative arc feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven with overly dense descriptions slowing momentum, and the connection between beginning and end is vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is evocative and complements the rebellious tone, with some sensory details enhancing mood; however, the connection between setting and brass microscope feels forced, and atmosphere only partially supports motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with symbolic imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the constrained length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style hinders clarity with overcomplex phrasing, and while thereâ€™s a lingering thought, the depth feels superficial.</comment>
