<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc exists with a journey and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between actions and outcomes are vague, lacking clear cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Acid rain forest setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere; however, the tone of "prickly wonder" occasionally clashes with the bleakness, diluting impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on ornate language and repetitive phrases like "ember of choice," feeling forced; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, lacking true originality or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but style often obscures clarity with overcomplex phrasing; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
