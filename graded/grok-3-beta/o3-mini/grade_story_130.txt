<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation for self-acceptance is present but lacks depth; his "privately open" attribute feels stated rather than shown through actions or distinct voice, resulting in a shallow portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but feels fragmented; the action of reverse-engineering fate is intriguing but lacks clear cause-and-effect progression, and pacing feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship setting is evocative and complements the cosmic tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports Alaric’s motivation, missing deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional resonance and subtext with themes of loss and self-acceptance, but it often tells rather than shows, and the ending feels more poetic than satisfying or purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>While the concept is ambitious, the writing leans on flowery, repetitive phrases like "cosmic winds" and generic metaphors, lacking originality; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story has a cohesive intent but struggles with clarity due to overly ornate language; creative elements are present but don’t fully leave a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
