<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the "lukewarm mage" lacks depth beyond vague determination and peculiarity, with motivations feeling abstract and ungrounded in specific actions or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while thereâ€™s a semblance of an arc, the progression feels disjointed, and the central action of clashing with shadows lacks clear stakes or resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lunar base setting is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse and often overwritten, diminishing atmospheric immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overwrought language and generic mystical tropes; metaphors like "charred serenity" feel forced, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated, style prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the story lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface aesthetics.</comment>
