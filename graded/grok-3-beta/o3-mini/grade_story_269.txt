<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias's nostalgic nature and motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits are present but underdeveloped; his personality lacks depth and a distinct voice, with actions feeling more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect relationships are vague, with the concept of parallel lives driving the narrative more through repetition than logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck and storm-laden atmosphere are evocative and complement the tone of hopeful desperation, but sensory details are often generic, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism of stitching and mirrors, but emotional impact is muted by overwrought language; conflict is present but lacks specificity, and the ending feels more abstract than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on flowery, repetitive phrases and generic descriptors suggests formulaic writing; metaphors are overused and lack freshness, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity; creative intent is visible, yet the narrative lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface themes.</comment>
