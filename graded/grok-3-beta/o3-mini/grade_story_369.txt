<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between mysterious packages and spiritual development feels forced, and pacing is uneven with overly dense exposition disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting on a rocky island is evocative and supports the tone of mystery, with some sensory details enhancing atmosphere, but the connection between setting and character motivation remains superficial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
