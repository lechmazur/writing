<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the deputy's impassive nature and personal impersonality are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced motivation beyond a vague quest for grace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc or resolution; the narrative meanders without a strong causal link between events, and the action of stretching perception feels forced rather than organic, disrupting coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting of the abandoned cathedral with a lush orchard is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, with sensory details creating an eerie mood, though the connection to oil changes feels arbitrary and undercuts immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of evocative imagery and symbolism with the twist tie and echoes, but lacks emotional depth or a satisfying ending; it tells more than shows, missing a strong central conflict or resonant theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly ornate language and purple prose, with generic descriptors and repetitive phrases like "uncharted echoes"; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than integral, and the style leans toward complexity over clarity, failing to leave a lasting impression or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
