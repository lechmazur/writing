<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation as a rebellious traveler writing obituaries for the living is intriguing but underdeveloped; actions feel symbolic rather than driven by clear personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of manifesting via the pipe organ is evocative but disconnected from a cohesive beginning-to-end structure, feeling more like a series of vignettes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional resonance through imagery and themes of rebellion, but lacks a satisfying ending or clear central conflict; heavy reliance on telling over showing diminishes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution leans on repetitive, ornate language and generic descriptors like "lucid frenzy," suggesting formulaic tendencies; emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in combining elements, but cohesion suffers from overambitious style and unclear stakes; brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
