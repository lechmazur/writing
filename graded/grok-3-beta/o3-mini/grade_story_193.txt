<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation for redemption and curing loneliness is clear, but the exiled prince lacks depth or distinct voice; his actions with the mortar and pestle feel symbolic but not personal or revealing of unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between actions and outcomes are vague, and the snowstorm encounter lacks impactful integration into the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office setting is evocative and supports the tone of desolation, but sensory details are sparse and generic; atmosphere aligns with loneliness but doesn’t fully enhance the action or object’s significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with loneliness and hope, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery is present but often clichéd, and the ending feels predictable rather than satisfying or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing leans on flowery, ornate language and generic descriptors like “whispers of a future”; lacks originality with predictable exiled prince trope and overused metaphors, showing little subversion or unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative awkwardly rather than serving it; style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
