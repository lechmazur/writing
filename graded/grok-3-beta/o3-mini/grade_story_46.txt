<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; the blank-faced performer’s motivations are vague and not convincingly tied to actions or traits like “uniquely typical,” which feels forced and undefined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; connections between actions and concepts like “guardian of rumors” are abstract and fail to drive a coherent narrative forward.</comment>
