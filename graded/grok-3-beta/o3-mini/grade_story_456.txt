<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Avalon's "morbid" and "neutrally passionate" traits feel stated rather than shown through actions or distinct voice, lacking depth in motivation beyond a vague cosmic curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of sifting through pages feels repetitive and fails to build meaningful progression or tension, resulting in a meandering narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is intriguing and enhances the mystical atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or memorable conflict; heavy reliance on abstract concepts like "cosmic cycles" overshadows concrete tension, and the writing often tells rather than shows emotion or growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overwrought, purple prose and repetitive phrasing like "tempered beliefs," which feels forced; metaphors are generic, and the narrative lacks a fresh or humanly nuanced perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated, style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the story fails to leave a lasting impression or deeper thought.</comment>
