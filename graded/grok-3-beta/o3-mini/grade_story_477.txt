<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Arion's motivation to escape suppression is clear, but his personality as a graceful swordsman feels underdeveloped; the grace is mentioned but not deeply reflected in his actions or voice beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Arion's quest for freedom, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between scavenging and cosmic signals lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly described with sensory details like bird songs and shimmering light, enhancing atmosphere, though the setting's connection to the telescope feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism are present, but the story leans heavily on telling rather than showing emotions; the ending is purposeful but lacks deep emotional resonance or subtext beyond the surface rebellion theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the underwater setting offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable rebellion tropes without subversion, and the language occasionally veers into purple prose, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style often obscures clarity with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
