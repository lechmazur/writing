<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to make peace with the past is clear, but the "shaky mercenary" lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel generic and not uniquely tied to the "carefully reckless" attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed introspection; connection between beginning and end is present but lacks strong causality or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the collapsed cathedral turned street artist’s haven is evocative and supports the tone of improbable longing; sensory details are present but often vague, missing sharper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the mercenary’s quest, with decent use of symbolism (amber/spider), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in setting and concept, but relies on overused metaphors and flowery language ("improbable longing"); emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but style often hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
