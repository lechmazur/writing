<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is vague; the "edgy tradesman" lacks depth beyond surface traits, and his actions feel driven by abstract concepts rather than personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; connections between actions and concepts like "vectorize" are forced and incoherent, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by overly ornate language and generic metaphors; emotional depth feels stated rather than shown, with some phrases feeling formulaic or overly complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite creative elements; style often obscures clarity, and the story feels more like a fragmented experiment than a deliberate, impactful narrative.</comment>
