<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels disjointed; the connection between the treasure map and vibration chamber is tenuous, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by forced integration of elements; style often obscures clarity with ornate language, and the story lacks a lingering impact despite creative intent.</comment>
