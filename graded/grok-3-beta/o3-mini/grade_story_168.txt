<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode rock art is present but lacks depth; the "ruthless flower arranger" trait feels superficial and disconnected from actions, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the scuffed comb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed; connections between spontaneous conversations and decoding rock art are vague, disrupting coherence and logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and supports the tone of polite anarchy, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe "between a singerâ€™s verses" feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through ancient secrets and rebellion, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; imagery is present but often overwrought, and the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on flowery, ornate language and generic descriptors, bordering on purple prose; lacks originality with predictable themes of mystery and rebellion, showing little subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style often hinders clarity with overly complex phrasing; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
