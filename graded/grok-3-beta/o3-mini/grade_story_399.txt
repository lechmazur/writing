<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the grumpy crypt caretaker's personality lacks depth beyond the label of "grumpy," and motivations feel vague despite trauma being central. Actions like jiggling the tube are not convincingly tied to personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the action of jiggling and the sand mandala method feel forced into the narrative rather than driving it. The arc lacks a clear resolution within the word limit, leaving the story feeling incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and generic, failing to fully immerse the reader or connect deeply with the caretaker's trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while trauma as a theme is present, it is often told rather than shown, lacking emotional resonance. Imagery and symbolism are overdone and lack originality, diminishing the ending's impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from purple prose and overly ornate language that feels forced and formulaic. Emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative relies on predictable mystical tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated rather than organic to the narrative. The style hinders clarity with excessive complexity, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
