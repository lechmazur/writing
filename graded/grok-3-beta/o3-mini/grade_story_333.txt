<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's sincerity and rebellious nature are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve traditions feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overly dense introspection slowing momentum; connections between actions and outcomes are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted passage and timeframe between storms create a compelling atmosphere with some sensory detail, but the tone of braided bitterness occasionally clashes with hopeful undertones, diluting impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., torn sticky note as talisman) add depth, but emotional resonance is weakened by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a sharp, memorable punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on predictable tropes of haunted settings and inner resolve without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style often overcomplicates clarity with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully, due to uneven execution.</comment>
