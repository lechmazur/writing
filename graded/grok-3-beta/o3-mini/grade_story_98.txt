<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the sentinel's faintheartedness is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, and motivation feels vague despite the desire to learn ancient writings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc; while there is a beginning and end, the middle feels meandering without significant progression or resolution within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly ornate language and generic mystical tropes about secret societies; metaphors feel forced and lack freshness, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style often hinders clarity with excessive elaboration.</comment>
