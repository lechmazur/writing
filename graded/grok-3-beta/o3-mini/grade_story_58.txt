<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Orion's loyalty as a scout is mentioned but not deeply explored or shown through actions; motivation to learn meditation feels vague and disconnected from his role, lacking depth in personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of radicalizing despair is abstract and underdeveloped, with pacing feeling rushed and connections between elements tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the moth observation tower is evocative and ties well to the tone of sanctified dread; sensory details like wind and flickering lights enhance atmosphere, though deeper integration with character motivation is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism of storms and balance, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending feels unresolved, and central conflict remains unclear or superficial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on ornate language and generic metaphors ("internal storms," "urban void"), feeling formulaic; lacks nuanced emotion or fresh perspective, with tone shifting unnaturally between dread and whimsy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is overly complex, hindering clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with little lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
