<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced and incomplete; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolutions and unclear cause-effect links within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport customs office is evocative with sensory details like server hums, but atmosphere inconsistently supports character motivation and lacks deeper integration with action.</comment>
