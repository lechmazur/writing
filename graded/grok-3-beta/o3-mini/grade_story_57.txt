<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Alistair's submissive nature and earnest flippancy are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there is a loose arc with the hummingbird rescue, the connection between eavesdropping and resolution feels forced, and pacing is rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are moderately effective with the secret agent workshop and yard work backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of earnest flippancy clashes with the espionage mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some symbolism with the hummingbird and letter opener, emotional resonance is weak, and the narrative relies on telling over showing, lacking a strong central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic descriptors and overused metaphors like "streams of opportunity"; the writing feels formulaic at times, lacking fresh perspectives or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and depth.</comment>
