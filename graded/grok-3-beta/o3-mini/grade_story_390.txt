<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Li Wei's calm demeanor as an assassin is present but lacks depth; his motivations are vague and not strongly tied to his actions or the botanical press, resulting in a character who feels more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the amalgamation action drives the story but feels abstract, and pacing is uneven with overly dense descriptions disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is evocative with sensory details like incense and lantern light, but the atmosphere of humorous unease feels forced and inconsistently applied, weakening its connection to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While imagery and symbolism (butterfly wings, botanical press) are present, the story lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying ending; it tells more than shows, and the central conflict remains unclear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The writing leans on overused metaphors and purple prose (e.g., "whispers of longing"), feeling formulaic at times; tone shifts unnaturally, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and while it leaves a lingering sense of mystery, it feels more like a fragment than a deliberate short piece.</comment>
