<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elyon's motivations are stated but lack depth or emotional grounding. The "hushed necromancer" trait feels underutilized, with little impact on actions or personality beyond surface mentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while mapping the cave provides a loose arc, the story meanders with repetitive interludes and lacks a strong resolution. Pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but the futuristic nostalgia tone feels forced and inconsistently tied to the setting or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or memorable subtext; imagery is present but often overwrought. The ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful, and the central conflict is vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from repetitive phrasing (e.g., "between sets") and generic descriptors. The narrative relies on predictable tropes of exploration and nostalgia without fresh twists or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. The style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the story lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
