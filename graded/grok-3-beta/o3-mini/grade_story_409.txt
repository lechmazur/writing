<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "bruised fighter" feels more symbolic than human, with actions driven by abstract ideals rather than personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; the action of "abducting dreams" is intriguing but lacks clear cause-effect progression, and pacing feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dusty attic with clockwork animals creates a vivid, surreal atmosphere that supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of the chisel strike feels more metaphorical than grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story evokes some reflection on self-deception, with decent use of symbolism, but the emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the writing leans on ornate, purple prose and generic metaphors, diminishing authenticity; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with creative elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overcomplex language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
