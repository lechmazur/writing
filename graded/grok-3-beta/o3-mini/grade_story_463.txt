<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of confiscating relics drives some progression, but pacing feels uneven with abrupt shifts between memory and present, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom is evocative with sensory details like creaks and gusts, enhancing mood, but the setting's connection to character motivation remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with eroding promises and dance, but emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing; ending feels unresolved and lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on repetitive phrases like "eroding promises" and generic descriptors, lacking originality; metaphors feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
