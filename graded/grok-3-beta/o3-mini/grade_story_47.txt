<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; pacing is uneven within the word limit, and connections between actions and outcomes are often unclear or forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels overly ornate with purple prose and repetitive phrasing; metaphors are generic, and the narrative lacks originality, relying on predictable patterns without fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style hinders clarity with overly complex language, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
