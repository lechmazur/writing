<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to embody values feels vague and underdeveloped; the groggy brewer lacks a distinct voice or personality beyond generic introspection, and reactions to the broken mirror are symbolic but not revealing of deeper traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of initiating a ritual feels disconnected from a logical progression, and pacing is uneven with overly dense introspection disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively eerie with the haunted mansion graveyard, enhanced by sensory details of darkness and cobblestones, but the setting’s connection to the protest lull feels forced and underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and while there’s some creative intent, it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
