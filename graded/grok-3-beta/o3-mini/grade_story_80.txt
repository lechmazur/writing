<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned roller coaster track is evocative and supports the eerie tone, but sensory details are sparse and inconsistently vivid, limiting immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on overused phrases like "whispers of forgotten lore" and lacks fresh metaphors; tone shifts slightly, hinting at formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but style often obscures clarity with ornate language; brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
