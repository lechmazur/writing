<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Arden's "casually intense" attribute is inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions or illusions; motivation to learn the language of the heart feels vague and unsupported by concrete actions or distinct voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the temple in the clouds is evocative and supports the ethereal tone, with some sensory detail, but the connection to the timeframe and object feels forced and underexplored, diminishing atmospheric impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Writing leans on flowery, ornate language and generic metaphors, bordering on purple prose; lacks originality in emotional portrayal and shows predictable patterns without subversion or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style often hinders clarity with excessive elaboration, and while thereâ€™s some creative intent, it fails to leave a lasting impression or depth.</comment>
