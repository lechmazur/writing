<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the uneasy emissary's motivations are vague and lack depth, with "learning universal patterns" feeling more like a plot device than a personal drive. No distinct voice emerges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; while thereâ€™s a semblance of an arc, the narrative feels more like a series of vignettes than a cohesive story. Pacing is uneven within the word limit, with rushed moments and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through cosmic imagery and symbolism, but emotional resonance is weak due to excessive telling over showing. The ending lacks a satisfying resolution, and the central conflict is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors like "branches of redemption" and generic cosmic imagery. Writing feels ornate with purple prose, lacking a distinct style, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; the assigned components often feel forced rather than integral. Style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
