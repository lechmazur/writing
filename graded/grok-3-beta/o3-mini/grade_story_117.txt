<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Originality suffers from purple prose and generic descriptors; metaphors like "dance between clarity and chaos" feel clichéd, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style’s complexity often obscures clarity, leaving little lasting impression or depth.</comment>
