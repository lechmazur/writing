<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining steampunk and personal history, but relies on overused metaphors (e.g., "shattered allegiances") and lacks fresh emotional nuance, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but style often obscures clarity with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
