<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eldric's hesitance and awkwardness are mentioned but not deeply explored; his motivation to restore traditional systems feels vague and lacks personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Eldric's quest, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and connections between actions and outcomes are often abstract rather than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and supports the atmosphere of decay and rebirth, though sensory details are sometimes repetitive and lack variety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the postcard and hermit crabs, but emotional impact is muted by overwrought language; conflict is present but resolution feels unearned and lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on ornate, purple prose and generic metaphors (e.g., "bridge between fractured histories") detracts from originality; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While some elements are creatively combined, the story lacks cohesion and clarity; the style often hinders rather than enhances impact, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
