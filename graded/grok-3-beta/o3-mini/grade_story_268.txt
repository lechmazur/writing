<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "subdued vigilante" concept feels underexplored, with actions not fully revealing inner conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; pacing is uneven within the word limit, and connections between actions and outcomes are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative "screaming silence," but sensory details are inconsistent, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (e.g., wooden bead, mirror distortions) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows traces of originality in concept, but relies on overused war metaphors and generic descriptors; tone shifts slightly, hinting at formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but style often obscures clarity; lacks a lingering impact or evidence of truly innovative thinking.</comment>
