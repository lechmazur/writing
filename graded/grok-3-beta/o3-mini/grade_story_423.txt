<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to "spark flames in a land of ice" feels vague and lacks depth; the earnest knight's personality is not distinct, and actions lack clear alignment with personal traits or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; connections between actions and outcomes are tenuous, and pacing feels uneven with overly descriptive detours.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting of the arid desert and ruined aqueduct is evocative, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully support the knight's motivation or the surreal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the map and tears, but emotional impact is muted by overwritten prose; lacks a clear central conflict or satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing feels overly ornate with generic metaphors like "canvas of life"; lacks originality, relying on predictable knight-quest tropes without subversion or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style prioritizes florid language over clarity or lasting impact.</comment>
