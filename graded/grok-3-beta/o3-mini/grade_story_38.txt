<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Julian's insomnia and poetic nature are present, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; the drive for non-violence feels abstract and underdeveloped, failing to reveal nuanced layers of personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while the concept of non-violence influences the narrative, the progression feels fragmented and the pacing uneven, with no strong causal links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and midnight timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like creaking floors and moonlight, but the connection to subway stops feels disjointed and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story employs vivid imagery and metaphor, but the emotional impact is diluted by repetitive themes of despair and hope; the ending lacks a satisfying punch, and the central conflict remains vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the writing often veers into purple prose with overly ornate language; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly unique perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; the style often hinders clarity with excessive complexity, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
