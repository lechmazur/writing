<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Abel's characterization as a rattled exorcist with an inwardly social nature and coy aggression feels underdeveloped; motivations are present but lack depth or specificity, and reactions to the postcard are generic rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the unlocking of the hidden room, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between dance lessons and the central action is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the characters' motivations or the dance lessons' integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with the science-wonder synthesis, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but not particularly memorable or striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the writing leans on generic descriptors and predictable paranormal tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often feels overwrought, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
