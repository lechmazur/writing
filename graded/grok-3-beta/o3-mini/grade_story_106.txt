<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eli's sullen nature and motivation to escape a dead end are stated but lack depth or distinct voice. Reactions to objects like stamps feel forced rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while thereâ€™s a vague arc of transformation, pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are weak, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underwater power station setting is evocative with some sensory detail, but its connection to character motivation and tone feels tenuous, missing deeper atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from formulaic language and generic metaphors; emotional portrayal is stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative feels predictable despite the unique setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
