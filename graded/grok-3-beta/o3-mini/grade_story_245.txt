<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; Garrick's irate nature and smuggling past are mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or distinct voice, making his personality feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while jogging drives the narrative, the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous, and pacing is uneven with overly dense introspection disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is evocative and supports the tone of desolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's quest for waterfalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through symbolism (chopstick, waterfalls), but emotional resonance is undermined by telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overwrought language and generic metaphors; the narrative feels formulaic at times, with stated emotions lacking nuanced subtext, suggesting a lack of authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style's complexity often obscures clarity, leaving little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
