<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; connections between bike rides, coded letter, and healing traditions are muddled, with pacing feeling rushed and transitions abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is intriguing and supports the mysterious tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation or the story's core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; literary devices like symbolism are present but feel forced, and the ending lacks impact or a satisfying resolution to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing feels overly ornate with repetitive phrases like "reawakened nightmares" and "harsh tenderness," suggesting formulaic tendencies; metaphors are generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
