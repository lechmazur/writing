<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a vague arc of renewal, the progression feels forced and lacks clear cause-effect links within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style hinders clarity with excessive ornamentation, leaving little lasting impact.</comment>
