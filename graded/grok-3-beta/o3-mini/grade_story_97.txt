<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "fact-minded" trait feels superficially applied and doesn't consistently shape actions or voice, resulting in a generic portrayal despite the intriguing premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a vague arc, the pacing feels rushed and connections between beginning and end are tenuous, with the action of recomposing not clearly driving a coherent narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The unstable dimension setting is vividly described with surreal imagery, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are uneven and the connection between setting and character motivation feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance; while imagery is abundant, it often feels overwrought, and the central conflict is vague, leaving the ending unsatisfying and the theme underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by repetitive, flowery language and generic descriptors; metaphors feel overused, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, suggesting formulaic writing rather than a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style’s complexity often obscures clarity, leaving little lasting impact.</comment>
