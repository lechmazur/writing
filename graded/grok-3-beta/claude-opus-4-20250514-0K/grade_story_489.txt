<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the girl's determination to revive tradition, but the portrayal lacks depth; her "aggressively kind" trait feels underexplored and lacks nuanced impact on her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; connections between ritual and outcome are logical but lack deeper causal weight within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively built with the haunted lighthouse and sensory details like dust motes and temperature drops, enhancing the mood; setting strongly supports the ritual's tone, though some sensory elements feel predictable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of remembrance, and imagery like the whale's call is striking, but the ending feels slightly pat; subtext is present but not deeply layered or provocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar ghost and ritual tropes without significant subversion; metaphors are fresh at times but occasionally generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
