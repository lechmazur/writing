<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a compelling obsession for delayed justice, but the seer's personality lacks depth beyond the cynical-trustful dichotomy; her voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a strong connection between beginning and end, driven by the decryption action; pacing is managed well within the word limit, though some exposition feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like petrichor; setting and tone strongly support the mood and motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the quest for truth, with a satisfying ending; however, subtext is underdeveloped, and the theme of justice feels surface-level without deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining prophecy with analytical innovation, but reliance on conspiracy tropes and predictable cover-up narrative dulls uniqueness; emotional nuance is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about truth; however, style lacks the polish for top-tier publication, and brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
