<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arcturus's portrayal as an old-fashioned mage with purposeful aimlessness is intriguing, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the curse's compulsion; the cuddle with the child feels abrupt and insufficiently tied to his established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the riddle driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—visions in mirrors are intriguing but rushed, and the resolution's emotional weight isn't fully earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse setting is vivid and contrasts beautifully with tropical plants, enhancing the tone of sanctified dread; sensory details are evocative, though the playground timeframe feels underutilized in atmosphere-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on life versus the void, with strong symbolism in mirrors and the fragment, but the ending's impact is diluted by a lack of buildup to the child’s interaction; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a mage in a modern arctic setting is original, and metaphors like the greenhouse as a cathedral are fresh, but the emotional resolution relies on a somewhat predictable "human connection" trope without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the greenhouse and mirrors, leaving a lingering question about choice, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped character depth prevent it from reaching top-tier impact.</comment>
