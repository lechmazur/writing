<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Marcus's stoicism is stated rather than shown through nuanced actions, and his emotional shift feels abrupt despite dialogue revealing vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but predictable; the chance encounter drives the story, but pacing feels rushed at the emotional turning point, undermining a fully satisfying arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The beekeeper’s sanctuary is vividly described with sensory details like honey and humming, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection to the timeframe (band stopping) is tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes mild emotional response through Marcus’s vulnerability, but symbolism (paper plane) feels forced; dialogue is purposeful but not always natural, and subtext is present but shallow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable emotional awakening trope; metaphors like “bees’ dance” are somewhat fresh but not striking, and emotional handling leans on telling over showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but don’t elevate the narrative to memorable heights, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
