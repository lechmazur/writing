<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Zara Thorne’s telekinetic gambling and practical philosophy shape her actions, but her deeper emotional layers and distinct voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed; connections between ancient languages and coordinates are intriguing but lack depth in cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the blend of sci-fi and medieval elements is fresh, some metaphors (dragons and flames) verge on cliché, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but brevity limits depth; it leaves a lingering idea of resilience, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate language.</comment>
