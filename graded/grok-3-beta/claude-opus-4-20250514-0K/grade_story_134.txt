<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's obnoxiously polite nature is distinct and shapes her interactions uniquely, but her deeper motivations and personal stakes remain underexplored within the word limit, limiting emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and end, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between eavesdropping on oaks and waking the unheard lacks sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber and laundry cycles create a striking, immersive setting with vivid sensory details like humming crystals, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about lost human magic and uses evocative imagery, but the emotional resonance is surface-level, and the dialogue, while polite, feels slightly repetitive rather than dynamic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of waking the unheard is original, and the writing shows individual style, but some metaphors (e.g., moths against glass) feel familiar, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks deeper emotional or intellectual lingering impact; the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, missing a profound takeaway.</comment>
