<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Maya's aloofness shaping her initial detachment, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and her shift toward reconnection lacks depth. Her voice is distinct but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is clear, though the action's impact on plot momentum is underwhelming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of memory and loss, enhanced by sensory details like holographic rivers. However, the atmosphere occasionally feels detached from the characters' emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the sisters' reconciliation, with effective symbolism in the cracked tile. However, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme of memory, while present, lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in combining memory with a futuristic setting, but metaphors like "city's growth rings" feel slightly overused. Emotional handling is nuanced at times but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel more integral than others. It leaves a lingering thought about memory, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
