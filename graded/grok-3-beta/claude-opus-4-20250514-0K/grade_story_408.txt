<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's role as a conscientious objector shapes his actions and moral dilemma effectively, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a logical progression from discovery to resolution within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are well-established with the migration map strategy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ravine setting and storm-battered orchard create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors Marcus's conflict; sensory details like "nature's gallows" are evocative, though some descriptions could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about nonviolent resistance, with strong symbolism in the rusty nails and migration routes; however, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and emotional depth is shown but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on nonviolence, but some metaphors like "broken glass" smiles are overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than fully shown, lacking deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like migration mapping, leaving a lingering thought on conscience over conflict; however, the style occasionally prioritizes clarity over flair, limiting impact.</comment>
