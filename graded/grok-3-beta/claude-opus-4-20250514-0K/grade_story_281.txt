<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from thief to poet is intriguing, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the dummy's influence; his voice feels distinct in poetry but underdeveloped in prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the transformation; cause and effect are logical, though the dummy's role as catalyst is abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room enhances the eerie tone and complements the transformation concept; sensory details like "salt-stained floor" are evocative, though underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on identity and change, with strong symbolism in the dummy; poetry adds impact, but dialogue feels stilted, and the theme, while clear, lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of transformation via poetry is original, but the talking dummy trope feels clich√©d without subversion; metaphors are fresh, yet emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought on transformation, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
