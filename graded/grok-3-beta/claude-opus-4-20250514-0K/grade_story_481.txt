<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows promise with the cartographer's obsession with mapping and memory, but her motivation feels underdeveloped—her emotional connection to her daughter lacks depth beyond the dragonfly memory, making her actions feel slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the blacksmith's discovery as a pivot, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to earlier events, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital ward is vividly rendered with sterile imagery and shifting corridors, effectively enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though sensory details are uneven—sound is strong, but other senses are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is notable with strong symbolism (dragonfly, forge) and a haunting theme of lost innocence, but emotional resonance is hindered by 'telling' over 'showing' in key moments, and the ending feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is mixed—while the blacksmith forging memories is a fresh metaphor, the narrative leans on familiar dystopian tropes of emotional suppression without fully subverting them, and some descriptors feel generic rather than specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the dragonfly and forge, but it struggles with emotional depth and stylistic consistency, leaving it short of a lingering, profound impact.</comment>
