<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization as a morbid florist with a neutrally passionate demeanor is intriguing, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the shift in belief lacks deeper internal conflict or backstory to anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the transition to understanding cosmic cycles via reading feels abrupt and lacks tension to drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting is evocative and ties well to the ethereal tone, enhanced by sensory details like the guttering lantern; however, the atmosphere could be deepened with more tactile or olfactory imagery to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on life-death cycles with strong symbolism in flower arrangement, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of visceral character reaction; dialogue is purposeful yet sparse, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist in a dojo offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "infinite sentence") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at a lack of unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but their integration sometimes feels forced rather than organic; it leaves a lingering thought on cycles, yet lacks the stylistic polish or depth for top-tier impact.</comment>
