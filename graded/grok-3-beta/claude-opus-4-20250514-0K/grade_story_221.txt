<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's character as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is intriguing, and her motivation to honor family tradition while stepping out of her mother's shadow is clear, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped, with reactions sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between ghostly interactions and personal growth are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocative, with strong sensory details like rust and autumn wind, enhancing the melancholic tone, though the connection between setting and deeper character motivation could be more explicitly woven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marina's thawing heart and family legacy, with effective symbolism in the amber, but dialogue feels slightly expository, and the central conflict's resolution lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a ghost-whispering diver is original, some metaphors (e.g., "salt-dried cheeks") feel overused, and emotional portrayal occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on direct statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like amber and tradition, leaving a lingering sense of purpose, but stylistic choices sometimes prioritize ornamentation over clarity, and depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
