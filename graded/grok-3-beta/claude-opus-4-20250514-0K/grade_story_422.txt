<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's selective mutism and use of Arthur as a ventriloquist dummy provide a unique voice, but her motivation feels underdeveloped beyond the archival obsession; reactions to the coffee sleeve lack depth in revealing her inner world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the overheard phone call drives the story forward, though cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach setting is vividly described with sensory details like "purple foam," enhancing the mood of euphoric agitation, but the connection between the setting and the coffee sleeve feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marina's rediscovery of family, with some effective imagery, but subtext is thin; Arthur's dialogue is purposeful, yet the central conflict lacks sharpness and resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the ventriloquist and parallel universe elements offer originality, some sensory details are generic, and emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing; metaphors like the coffee sleeve's logo are interesting but not fully fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; style is clear, yet the brief length exposes underdeveloped depth, missing a lingering impact beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
