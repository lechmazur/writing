<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s introverted nature and dancer background are well-integrated into her solitary persistence and rhythmic decoding, but her motivation for escape lacks deeper emotional grounding beyond the surface desire for freedom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with knitting as a novel method driving the narrative, but the connection between beginning and end feels slightly forced, and the pacing stumbles with overly dense exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desolate wasteland and cipher decoder’s office create a compelling, isolated atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the smell of old paper, though the setting’s connection to Maya’s motivation could be more explicitly tied to her past as a dancer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet, reflective impact through metaphors of dance and cosmic rhythms, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the theme of transformation lacks sharper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of knitting astronomical data is original, some metaphors (e.g., “crucible”) feel overused, and emotional resonance is more stated than shown, missing nuanced human depth in favor of logical progression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
