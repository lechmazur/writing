<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Itzel’s steady and whimsical nature shapes her unique approach to gravedigging, but her deeper motivations feel underexplored beyond the ritualistic duty; her voice is distinct yet lacks emotional depth in key moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to revelation feels complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven with rushed transitions; the concept of overlapping worlds drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Aztec temple reimagined as a modern cultural center is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like flickering torch flames; atmosphere supports the mystical tone, though some setting-object connections feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its cosmic balance theme and uses potent imagery like shifting hieroglyphs; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and dialogue, while sparse, feels natural yet lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original take on overlapping realities, but some metaphors (e.g., “raucous silence”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative integration, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; the brief length feels intentional, yet depth is sacrificed, leaving lingering ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
