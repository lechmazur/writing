<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to save her brother is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the crisis; her voice is indistinct, and reactions feel somewhat generic despite the unique context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and emotional resolution, though pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, but some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Migration Pattern Archive setting is vividly imagined and enhances the tone of desperate hope; sensory details like flickering screens and radio static are effective, though some elements feel underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Miraâ€™s bond with her brother, and the theme of connection is present, but literary devices like sacred geometry as metaphor are heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of labyrinth architects is intriguing, the execution relies on genre tropes of interdimensional travel without subversion; metaphors are somewhat fresh but not striking, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like sacred geometry and vintage calling cards, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
