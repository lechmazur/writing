<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's role as a social media exorcist shapes his actions, but his motivations shift too abruptly from purging to joining without sufficient internal conflict or depth. His voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue and narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of infiltrating clubs driving progression. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution of Marcus's shift in purpose lacks grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned settings and midnight timeframe create a haunting atmosphere that complements the concept of digital ghosts. Sensory details like phantom symphonies are evocative, though some settings feel underutilized in enhancing character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on digital connection, with subtext about platforms as the true haunting. Imagery and symbolism are present but not always impactful. Dialogue is purposeful but not natural. The ending feels purposeful yet slightly unsatisfying due to abrupt character change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of digital guerrilla warfare offers originality, but reliance on familiar cyberpunk tropes without deep subversion limits uniqueness. Sensory details are specific but not always vivid. Emotional handling shows nuance at times, though Marcus's shift feels somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with metaphors, hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering thought about digital authenticity, but lacks the polish for top-tier impact.</comment>
