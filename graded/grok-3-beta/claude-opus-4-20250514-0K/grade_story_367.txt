<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the herbalist’s internal conflict over perfection, but her motivation feels vague and inconsistently tied to studying tides; her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks deeper causality or tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the glass-walled observatory is evocative and supports the mood of isolation; sensory details are present but could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the herbalist’s realization, and symbolism of the goose and bellows adds depth, but the ending feels slightly predictable; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with thoughtful imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., sand slipping through fingers) feel overused; emotional resonance is there but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the bellows, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
