<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Mayaâ€™s aloofness as an orphan shaping her initial emotional distance, but her transformation feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuanced dialogue to fully flesh out her voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from grief to action, driven by the anomaly and stones, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat of tension before resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized with sensory details like spiraling dust and humming stabilizers, enhancing the atmosphere of adaptation and loss, though some sensory elements could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with evocative imagery (stones singing, fear dancing) and a satisfying ending, but emotional depth occasionally leans on telling over showing, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of stones as survival stories, but some metaphors (fear transforming) feel familiar, and emotional handling, while nuanced, occasionally borders on predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres well with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about adaptation, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
