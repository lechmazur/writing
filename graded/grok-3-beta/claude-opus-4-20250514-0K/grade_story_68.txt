<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's moral code as a hacker is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; his voice feels functional rather than distinct, and reactions to the bottle caps are more plot-driven than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the adoption action’s connection to the broader narrative feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The virtual Roman marketplace is vividly reimagined and complements the tone of confident uncertainty; sensory details like digital torches are evocative, but the connection between the setting and the bottle caps feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the theme of restoring identity, and the ending is satisfying; however, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and while there is subtext, the central conflict lacks intensity within the brief format.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending ancient and digital worlds, but relies on familiar tropes of “lost identity” without fully subverting them; metaphors are fresh in places, though emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a well-crafted short piece.</comment>
