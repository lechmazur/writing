<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing with Margot's ruthless flower arranger persona blending with intellectual spontaneity, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper emotional stakes beyond curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves a sense of arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the spontaneous road trip conversations as a method are underutilized in driving the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like humming stones and starlight, enhancing the atmosphere of enigma, though the timeframe's integration feels more symbolic than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with evocative imagery and subtext about seeing connections, but the emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique blend of flower arranging and ancient rock art, but some metaphors (e.g., "wind chimes in a hurricane") feel slightly overused, and emotional depth occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated insights.</comment>
