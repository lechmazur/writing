<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Vera's relentless search tied to grief and hope, but her irate nature as a smuggler feels underexplored in action and dialogue, lacking a distinct edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a shift from searching to realization, but pacing feels uneven; the symbolic resolution of the waterfall as a metaphor arrives abruptly, disrupting narrative flow within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered with sensory details like rusted towers and cracked domes, enhancing the desolate mood, though connection to jogging timeframe feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through Vera's internal struggle and uses strong symbolism with the waterfall, but the ending feels more intellectual than visceral, and dialogue is limited, missing opportunities for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like the waterfall as reunion are fresh, some language verges on purple prose with overly ornate phrases, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on explicit statement over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the chopstick and tea leaves, but the style sometimes obscures clarity with dense imagery, and the brief length feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
