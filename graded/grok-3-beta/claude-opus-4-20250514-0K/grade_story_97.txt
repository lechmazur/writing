<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's portrayal as a fact-minded oracle transitioning to emotional depth shows potential, but her motivation feels somewhat surface-level; the shift from logic to empathy lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the compass guiding Mira toward a resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between heartbreak and visions is not fully fleshed out, leaving some cause-effect gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unstable dimension and starlit garden create a vivid atmosphere that supports the story’s tone of optimistic desperation, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the surreal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Mira’s journey to empathy, with effective metaphors like the compass as hope, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of heartbreak-induced visions offers originality, some imagery (e.g., reality rippling like water) feels overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, showing creative intent in combining heartbreak and empathy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
