<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Li Wei's portrayal as a chameleon stage actor is intriguing, with his rationally impulsive nature informing his unique approach to solving mysteries, but his personal motivations and inner conflict lack deeper exploration, leaving his character somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, with a clear resolution, but pacing is uneven—rushing through the discovery of the skeletons while lingering on less impactful descriptions, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace reimagined in a post-oil era is vividly realized, and the sunlight through debris creates a haunting atmosphere, though sensory details like smell and touch are underutilized, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
