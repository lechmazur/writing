<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, and her motivation to understand her gift is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "elegantly clumsy" trait, which feels surface-level and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc within the word limit, and the act of letting go drives the resolution; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a unique and evocative setting that enhances the ghostly atmosphere and theme of preservation, with sensory details like silence and sand effectively used; however, the lunch break timeframe feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the act of liberation, with effective symbolism in the flower crown and sand castles, but the impact is diminished by a lack of deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the theme of letting go is clear but not profoundly explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a somewhat fresh take on ghosts, the emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown at times, and the metaphors, though creative, occasionally verge on predictable; overall, it shows some individual style but lacks a striking uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a deeply profound one.</comment>
