<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to solve the riddle is clear, and the "ingeniously clueless" trait drives her obsession, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single-mindedness, resulting in a flat portrayal with no distinct voice or nuanced reaction to unfolding events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit with a clear beginning, middle, and unsettling end, driven by the concept of the last fragment; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the roller coaster setting and plot progression is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster track and eerie tone of quiet mania create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the groaning track and warm doorknob; yet, the setting's integration with the character's actions feels underutilized, missing a deeper thematic connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and prompts reflection on obsession, with strong imagery like "reality thinned" and "wood becoming paper," but the lack of dialogue and limited emotional depth hinder impact; the ending is purposeful yet predictable, missing a truly memorable twist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original take on haunted inns and riddles, some metaphors like "pages rustling in an empty library" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but stated rather than shown, and the tone remains consistent without jarring shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the riddle and doorknob, leaving a lingering sense of dread; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
