<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>General Markov's burnout and military background are clear, but his internal transformation feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper exploration of personal conflict. His voice is distinct yet underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax of transformation. Cause and effect are logical, though coherence suffers from occasional over-symbolism disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Dark Matter Diner setting is vividly realized with sensory details like dried seaweed and impossible coffee, enhancing the rationally absurd atmosphere. Tone and setting align well with the concept of shared anxieties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on fear and meaninglessness through strong imagery and subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by an overly intellectualized ending. Dialogue is purposeful, though not particularly natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., "event horizon" coffee) feel slightly overused. Emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length seems to limit depth rather than being a deliberate choice. It leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
