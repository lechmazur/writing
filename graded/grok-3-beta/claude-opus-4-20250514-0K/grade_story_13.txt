<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a logical progression from quest to discovery, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between poems and action could be deeper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The toppled clock tower and shifting sands create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the theme of broken time, with strong sensory details like ticking clocks and erased footprints; however, some sensory elements lack specificity.</comment>
