<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, driven by loss and a desperate hope to reconnect with the past, but the trapper's personality lacks depth beyond grief; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the distinct backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical progression toward the black hole, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like the sea glass's warmth) are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the floating observatory is vividly rendered with sensory details like frost and ozone, enhancing the gritty tone, though the connection between setting and sea glass feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the trapperâ€™s loss and hope, with strong imagery like "caught starlight," but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is original, combining loss with cosmic phenomena, some metaphors (e.g., space as a beast) feel overused, and emotional portrayal occasionally leans on stating rather than showing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the black hole of doubt, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
