<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s stoic nature is well-portrayed through his unchanging demeanor and subtle rebellions, with clear motivation tied to defying conformity; however, his inner voice lacks distinctiveness, feeling somewhat generic despite strong alignment with the cameo and his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a subtle build from routine to quiet rebellion, and pacing is managed well within the word limit; yet, the connection between beginning and end feels slightly understated, missing a sharper resolution or emotional peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is vividly realized and enhances the theme of cracks in the façade, with strong atmospheric tension; sensory details are present but could be more varied and evocative to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story carries subtext about resistance and memory, with effective symbolism via the cameo and miniature rebellions; however, the emotional impact is muted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch to elevate it to unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its concept of subtle rebellion in miniature, with fresh metaphors like the lullaby of conformity; still, some descriptions (e.g., “perfect preservation”) feel predictable, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with thoughtful integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; yet, the overall impact is restrained, leaving a lingering thought but not a profound question or feeling that demands deeper reflection.</comment>
