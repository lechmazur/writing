<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc from grief to hope within the word constraint, with the clash of memories driving tension, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing a beat to fully land the emotional shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lunar base setting is evocatively rendered with sensory details like metallic air and silence, enhancing the tone of loss and isolation, though the connection between the doormat and setting could be more explicitly tied to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through Elara's grief and release, with strong imagery like memory-mist and effective subtext about letting go, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a final punch to elevate it to unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on grief via magical echoes, some metaphors (e.g., "constellations of loss") verge on overused, and emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than fully shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
