<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as a professional cuddler shapes her actions and motivations effectively, but her inner transformation regarding prejudice feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper internal conflict or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and the concept of decay drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is evocatively described with sensory details, enhancing the mood of loss and connection, though the timeframe reference feels forced and underutilized in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response and uses imagery well, but the dialogue feels slightly stiff, and the theme of transcending boundaries, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler with a Fader is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "sugar in rain") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
