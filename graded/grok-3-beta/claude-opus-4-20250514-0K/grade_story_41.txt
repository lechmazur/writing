<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to break free from societal expectations is clear and aligns with her cosmic powers and academic wildness, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her voice is not distinct enough to stand out in a competitive market.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and transformative end, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the ritual’s climax, and the connection between her factory life and cosmic destiny could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking, immersive atmosphere that enhances the theme of risk and transcendence; however, sensory details are uneven, with some vivid imagery (stardust, stone wings) but others feeling generic or underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Maya’s rebellion, with strong symbolism in the brooch and abyss, but the ending feels slightly predictable; subtext is present but not deeply layered, and the writing occasionally leans on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a factory worker with cosmic powers is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar tropes of hidden destiny without sufficient subversion; metaphors like “galaxies in her blood” feel somewhat overused, though the writing shows individual style in parts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the ritual and setting, and it leaves a lingering thought about forging one’s fate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity sometimes limits deeper exploration.</comment>
