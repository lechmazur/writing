<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Professor Elara Thorne's amiability and scholarly nature are present, but her motivations and reactions feel somewhat surface-level; deeper emotional nuance or conflict could elevate her distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration within the word limit; cause and effect are logical yet predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is evocatively described with strong sensory details like vibrating timbers and moving shadows, enhancing the mood, though the timeframe connection feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and offers symbolic depth with the shadow doorway, but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; the ending is purposeful yet not entirely resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of navigating shadows is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar supernatural tropes without significant subversion; metaphors are decent but not strikingly fresh, and emotional resonance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact; the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
