<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's overzealousness as a park ranger is well-integrated into her relentless documentation and pursuit of the goddess's echo, but her deeper emotional layers and distinct voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with the transformation of the orchard and Mira's purpose, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between fluctuating reality and the goddess's echo lacks precise cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a repurposed highway overpass is vividly realized with evocative details like upward-falling blossoms and humming soil, strongly enhancing the chaotic tone and atmosphere, though some sensory details remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on humanity's dreams versus divinity's memory, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and emotional resonance relies more on concept than nuanced character reaction within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its post-dream world and rewilding theme, with fresh metaphors like "dream-static," but occasionally leans on familiar tropes of hidden divinity without fully subverting them, and some descriptive language borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the orchard and goddess's echo, but the style sometimes prioritizes poetic abstraction over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
