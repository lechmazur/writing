<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's uncertainty as a champion and her rational yet rebellious nature are evident, but her deeper motivations feel surface-level; her connection to the amber brooch is touching yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with Elara's action to underpin tradition driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chalk cliff artist colony setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of cheerful gloom; sensory details like church bells and honey-colored shadows enhance atmosphere, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Elara's quiet revolution, with symbolism in the amber brooch, but dialogue feels slightly stiff, and the theme of imperfect love lacks deeper subtext beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in blending tradition with progress, metaphors like the "web strong enough to catch falling traditions" feel somewhat predictable; emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about tradition versus progress, though not profoundly.</comment>
