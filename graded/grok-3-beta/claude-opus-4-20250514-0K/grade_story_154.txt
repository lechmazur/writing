<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maeve’s motivation to document the supernatural is clear, and her “strongly weak” attribute shapes her trembling yet fierce persona. However, her voice feels underdeveloped, and her reactions to the ink pot lack deeper personal revelation beyond inherited duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the concept of courage strands influencing direction. However, pacing feels uneven—some supernatural incidents are rushed, and cause-effect links between game and reality are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Celtic village setting and timeframe between games mesh well, enhancing the tone of jubilant despair. Sensory details like glowing smartphones and cobblestone heartbeat are evocative, but some atmospheric elements feel forced, not fully supporting Maeve’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response through the collision of worlds, with strong imagery like the swirling ink pot. Yet, the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in blending digital and ancient worlds, with some fresh metaphors like digital mushrooms. However, it occasionally leans on predictable supernatural tropes without subversion, and emotional nuance is sometimes stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, like the ink pot and courage strands. Yet, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
