<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's amiable gambler persona is well-portrayed as a mask for deeper motives, but his internal transformation and obsession lack deeper emotional nuance; motivation is clear but feels slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by Marcusâ€™s quest, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; connections between action and concept are logical yet lack deeper integration to elevate the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds setting is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of loss and hope; tone of peaceful anger complements the setting, though some connections to action feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through imagery of lost bioluminescence, with some effective symbolism (fireflies as hope), but the ending feels more functional than resonant; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of restoring a kingdom via gambling and chemistry is unique, some metaphors (petals falling) feel slightly overused; emotional depth is shown rather than told, but overall style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the ledger and fireflies, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering idea of restoration, though not deeply impactful.</comment>
