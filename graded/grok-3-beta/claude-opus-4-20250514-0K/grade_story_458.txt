<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve her order's tradition is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular goal; her voice, while distinct in intent, feels more functional than unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the binary choice providing tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between coffee stain readings and outcomes are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport baggage claim is vividly rendered with evocative details, enhancing the atmosphere of loss, though sensory specifics for smell or touch are sparse, and the tone of fractal sorrow occasionally overpowers subtlety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on tradition versus progress, with strong imagery like coffee stains as futures, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional depth is more stated than shown through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of reading coffee stains is original, some metaphors (e.g., "autumn leaves across dead worlds") feel familiar, and emotional resonance leans on explicit statements rather than subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering question of risk versus safety, but the style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
