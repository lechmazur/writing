<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elena's shift from physician to archaeologist, driven by unfinished tales, but her personality lacks depth and distinct voice beyond the "bleary-eyed" trope; reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and implied resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between coffee grounds and inscriptions are intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The digital nomad camp setting is unique and ties to the timeframe, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere supports the tone of mystery, though it lacks immersive depth in evoking the ruins or sea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has potential for emotional impact with Elena's rediscovery of purpose, but it leans on telling over showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch; symbolism of the cutlass is promising but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining archaeology, medicine, and piracy, but the narrative occasionally relies on predictable tropes like "ancient secrets"; writing style is clear yet lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but brevity seems more a limitation than a choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought, though not profoundly memorable or deep.</comment>
