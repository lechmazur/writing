<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to stage fright and family deception is intriguing, but the exorcist's personality lacks depth beyond the inherited lies; reactions to wildflowers feel symbolic but not personal enough to reveal nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves a sense of completeness with a clear resolution, and the concept of inherited lies drives the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing finer emotional beats within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting is vividly realized and enhances the action of assembly, with a defiant tone complementing the concept; sensory details like the sound of a key in vacuum stand out, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought about deception and possibility, with strong imagery and symbolism in blooming wildflowers; ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original take on exorcism as sculpting possibilities avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors like the cosmic key; however, some emotional descriptions feel stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like orbital debris and wildflowers; brevity seems deliberate, though style occasionally leans ornate, risking clarity over impact.</comment>
