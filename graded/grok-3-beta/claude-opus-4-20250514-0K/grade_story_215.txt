<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Marcus show potential with a dual nature (priest and dancer with secrets), but motivations feel partially underdeveloped; his internal conflict lacks deeper emotional texture beyond surface tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed toward the end, and the puzzle-solving premise lacks grounding, making the resolution less impactful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesion is present with creative element integration, but the story's depth feels constrained by brevity; lingering impact is moderate but not profound.</comment>
