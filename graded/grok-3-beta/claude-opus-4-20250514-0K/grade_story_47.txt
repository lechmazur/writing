<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sarah’s motivation to reframe art and confront mortality is clear and consistent with her dutiful yet resentful persona, but her inner transformation lacks depth due to limited exploration of her past or emotional nuance beyond her illness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from disillusionment to posthumous impact is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, with her death introduced abruptly, undermining emotional weight; cause and effect between voice notes and actors’ changes is logical but underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary setting is evocative and enhances the tone of isolation and beauty, with sensory details like muffled heartbeats grounding the atmosphere; however, the setting’s connection to Sarah’s motivation feels slightly underdeveloped beyond symbolic silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on art and mortality with strong subtext and imagery like “graceless beauty,” but the ending feels more tragic than satisfying; it shows rather than tells yet lacks a fully resonant central conflict due to limited actor interactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of cryptic voice notes offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “dreams calcified like tumors”) verge on cliché; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the tone remains consistent but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like voice notes, but the brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought on mortality, yet style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
