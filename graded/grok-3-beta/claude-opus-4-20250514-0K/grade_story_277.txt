<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on giants as gentle creators, some metaphors (e.g., “starlight” and “sparks of wonder”) feel generic, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate language, hinting at formulaic tendencies over unique voice.</comment>
