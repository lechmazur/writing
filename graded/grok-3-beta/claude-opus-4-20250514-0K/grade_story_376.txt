<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Seidr's motivation to archive emotions is intriguing and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of a mysterious fortune teller; her voice, while distinct, feels somewhat theatrical and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the unspoken offer driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a stronger emotional punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Viking longhouse setting is vividly reimagined and enhances the atmosphere of mystery; sensory details like the amber inkwell's scent are evocative, though some descriptions feel overly ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic tone and uses symbolism effectively (amber ink as preserved emotion), but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of archiving emotions is original, some metaphors (e.g., "colorful ghosts") feel generic, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly formal language, detracting from authenticity; emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style sometimes leans toward over-elaboration, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about emotional preservation, though not powerfully so.</comment>
