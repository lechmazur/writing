<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brutus's portrayal as a docile bruiser with a disturbingly calm demeanor is intriguing, and his motivation to transform into a mythmaker is clear, but his inner voice and emotional depth remain underdeveloped, leaving his reactions somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the treasure map and baton driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links between the ritual and transformation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like carnivorous whispers and jazz drumbeats, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels somewhat incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about transformation and language through symbolism of the baton and plants, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, lacks deeper nuance or emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on resurrection and language barriers, some imagery (e.g., "impossible blooms") feels generic, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing, missing deeper human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the baton and labyrinth, leaving a lingering thought about transformation, but stylistic choices occasionally overcomplicate clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
