<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tired swordsman’s fiercely apathetic nature is intriguing and shapes his internal conflict, but his motivation feels somewhat buried beneath repetitive introspection, lacking sharp clarity in action alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a subtle arc within the word limit, with meteor showers driving a ritualistic action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between resignation and defiance are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is vividly rendered and complements the tone of quiet rebellion, with meteors enhancing atmosphere, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery, missing deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic reflection on perseverance with strong subtext of hidden defiance, but the ending feels more implied than impactful, and emotional depth relies on telling over showing at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fierce apathy offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “star-drunk darkness”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced reactions, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative use of meteor showers as ritual, but the style occasionally overreaches with heavy introspection, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
