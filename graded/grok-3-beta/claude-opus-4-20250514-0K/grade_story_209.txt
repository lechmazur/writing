<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Marcus's obsessive search for his brother, but his personality lacks depth beyond the quest; the hairbrush connection feels sentimental rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between echo measurement and emotional revelation is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though its link to the water tower and hospital feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Emotional impact is present with the theme of honesty, and the ending is poignant, but dialogue feels slightly stiff, and subtext is not fully layered beyond the surface guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some imagery (e.g., "weight of five decades lift") is predictable; emotional nuance is present but not consistently shown through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with a lingering emotional note, but integration of elements like the hairbrush feels slightly contrived; style is clear but lacks distinct flair for top-tier publication.</comment>
