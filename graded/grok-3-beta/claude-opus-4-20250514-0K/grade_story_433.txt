<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the hardheaded traveler's stubbornness is evident, but her internal transformation lacks depth and feels abrupt. Motivation is clear but not consistently tied to actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution. The connection between prophecy scraps and the gallery is logical, though not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with the ephemeral art gallery and snow days enhancing the mood of impermanence. Sensory details are effective, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a reflective tone with strong symbolism of melting ice and surrender, but emotional impact is muted by overt explanation rather than nuanced showing. Theme of power’s cost is clear yet lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the gallery concept, but some metaphors (e.g., “frozen tears”) feel overused. Emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication. It leaves a lingering thought, though the execution feels constrained by the length.</comment>
