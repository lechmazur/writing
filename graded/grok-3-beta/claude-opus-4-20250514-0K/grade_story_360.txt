<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's meekness and sincerity shape her unique approach to necromancy, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper internal conflict or backstory to fully ground her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear resolution, but pacing feels unevenâ€”key moments like the power loss are underexplored, and the revelation via dewdrop, while creative, feels abrupt and slightly disconnected from prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with sensory details like phosphorescent glow and playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone, though the connection between setting and the broken pen feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on life and death through the tapestry metaphor, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional depth is somewhat surface-level, relying more on telling than showing nuanced feelings; imagery is strong yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a meek necromancer is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., "morning fog") feel generic, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable fantasy tropes without subversion, diminishing originality despite a unique setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brevity feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on life-death interplay, though not with exceptional depth.</comment>
