<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Brother Marcus's transformation from missionary to doubter is compelling, with clear motivation tied to tested faith, but his inner conflict lacks deeper introspection or distinct voice, feeling somewhat surface-level for a character-driven piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the decoding of piano echoes as a plot device is intriguing but underexplored, leaving the resolution slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass desert setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of isolation and the butterfly’s migration, though the connection between the fork and setting feels tangential at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (butterfly, fork, piano) and a lingering theme of faith through doubt create impact, but emotional resonance is somewhat muted by telling over showing; the ending satisfies yet lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique blend of magic and faith with the glass desert, but some metaphors (e.g., butterfly’s dance) feel slightly clichéd; emotional nuance is present but not fully fleshed out, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration of setting and theme, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering thought on faith, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
