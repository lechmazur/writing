<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shaky mercenary's characterization is intriguing with the 'carefully reckless' attribute shaping his journey, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a surface-level need for peace. His reaction to the amber reveals some inner conflict, though his voice feels indistinct in the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the action of 'finalizing' feels underdeveloped as a driver. Pacing is uneven, with some rushed emotional shifts, though the concept of searching for the unknown ties the narrative loosely together.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of improbable longing. The atmosphere supports the mercenary's motivation well, though the connection between the amber and setting feels slightly forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of letting go, with effective use of symbolism (amber as frozen time). However, the ending feels somewhat predictable, and subtext is present but not deeply layered. Conflict resolution is satisfying but lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (e.g., 'light shifting like forgiveness') feel overused. Emotional handling shows nuance in places but occasionally relies on explicit statements. The narrative perspective is unique but not strikingly original, with minor tonal shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, and the brevity feels mostly deliberate. Creative thinking is evident in combining elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering feeling, though not profoundly so.</comment>
