<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivienne's glamorous undertaker persona is intriguing and shapes her actions, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit; her transition from ignorance to purpose lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc and the concept of "elongating" drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at key moments, and the connection between the social network archive and the funeral home setting is not fully cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details like the paint mixer and sequined veil, enhancing the tone of jubilant remorse; however, the social network archive feels underutilized as a setting beyond a plot device.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on death and dreams through vivid imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict of incomplete funerals lacks deeper emotional stakes within the word constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of measuring dreams is original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors; however, some emotional descriptions lean toward the stated rather than shown, and the tone occasionally wavers between solemn and whimsical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels mostly cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about death's beauty; yet, the brief length slightly hinders depth, and style occasionally overreaches with ornate language.</comment>
