<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erasmus’s cynical yet humbly arrogant nature is well-defined and drives his obsession with the ephemeral, but his sudden shift to accepting shared isolation feels slightly unearned without deeper internal conflict or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the action of awakening the globe, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the emotional climax, missing a beat for deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse library setting and eerie nostalgic tone pair beautifully with the concept of borrowed time, enhanced by vivid imagery like the sweeping beam and dusty shelves, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes loneliness and connection effectively through subtext and imagery, with a poignant ending, but dialogue, while purposeful, occasionally borders on expository, slightly diminishing natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on isolation and time, some metaphors (e.g., “light from dead stars”) feel familiar, and emotional depth, though present, occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of shared solitude, though minor stylistic heaviness and rushed emotional resolution prevent it from reaching top-tier impact.</comment>
