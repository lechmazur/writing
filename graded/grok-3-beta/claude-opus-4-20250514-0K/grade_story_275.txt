<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond her dedication to the task. Her "theoretically rebellious" attribute is mentioned but not deeply explored in her actions or inner conflict. A distinct voice is absent, as the third-person narration doesn't fully capture her unique perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from the comet's appearance to the orchard's revival. The action of translating cosmic angles into planting seeds drives the narrative effectively, though the pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution. Coherence is maintained, but the cause-effect link between the comet and sprouting feels more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a striking, cohesive atmosphere that enhances the deliberate wilderness tone. Sensory details, like the crimson light and skeletal trees, immerse the reader effectively. The setting supports the hermit's motivation, though the connection between the comet and the orchard's revival could be more tangibly described.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on patience and rebellion, with strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., the weathervane as a bridge between sky and earth). The ending is satisfying, but the central conflict feels understated. Subtext about human persistence is present, though emotional resonance could be deepened by showing more of the hermit's internal struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique blend of astronomy and agriculture, but some metaphors (e.g., "dead earth") feel slightly overused. The writing style is purposeful, though occasionally ornate. Emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone remains consistent without unnatural shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the pressed flower album and weathervane angle. The short length suits the deliberate pacing, and the lingering idea of patient rebellion adds depth. However, the style occasionally prioritizes symbolism over clarity, and emotional impact could be stronger with deeper character insight.</comment>
