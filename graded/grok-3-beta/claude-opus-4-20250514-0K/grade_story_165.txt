<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through Mira’s triumph and the theme of justice; the butterfly as a symbol of memory is impactful, though dialogue feels slightly stilted and the ending, while satisfying, lacks a deeper lingering question.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in the stained glass butterfly’s role, with fresh metaphors like voices trapped in amber; however, some emotional expressions feel stated rather than shown, and the dwarven elders’ trope of corruption isn’t subverted enough.</comment>
