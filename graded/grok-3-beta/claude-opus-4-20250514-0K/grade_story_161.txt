<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's vigilance as an orchardist shapes his meticulous investigation, and his motivation tied to personal tragedy is clear, but his emotional depth remains surface-level; reactions to the letter seal are symbolic yet lack nuanced personal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is driven by the conspiracy unraveling, with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between paper airplane patterns and orchard accidents is tenuously explained, disrupting full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility setting is intriguing but underutilized for atmosphere; sensory details are sparse, and the tone of sardonic glee clashes occasionally with the somber motivation, missing deeper immersive impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through loss and justice themes, with effective peacock symbolism, but dialogue feels slightly forced; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the conspiracy angle offers some originality, the story leans on familiar whistleblower tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like wax as blood are decent but not strikingly fresh, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctive flair, and while it leaves a lingering idea of justice, depth beyond the narrative is limited.</comment>
