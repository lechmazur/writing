<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Keras's morose nature is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to restore the systems feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced action. The needle’s personal significance is a nice touch but lacks emotional depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the blackout and restoration providing structure. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between visible changes and the resolution could be more explicitly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The solar flare observatory setting is evocative and enhances the theme of cosmic connection. Sensory details like obsidian walls swallowing light are strong, though the atmosphere could further amplify Keras’s melancholy with more personal sensory ties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild wonder at the ending, with some effective imagery (e.g., stars rewriting themselves). However, the emotional impact is diluted by surface-level character reactions, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of stars communicating is intriguing, the execution leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without significant subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh but not consistently striking, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate. However, it lacks a truly lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative, and the style, while competent, doesn’t elevate the material to excellence.</comment>
