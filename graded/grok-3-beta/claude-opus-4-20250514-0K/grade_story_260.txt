<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor Thorne's obsession with cryptic crosswords is intriguingly tied to her decoding skills, but her deeper personality and emotional depth remain underdeveloped, leaving her motivation feeling slightly abstract despite its clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with decoding diaries driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed emotional resolutions at the end lacking sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whisper collection point and starless night create a haunting atmosphere that complements the theme of lost souls, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional resonance through the concept of reconciliation, with decent use of symbolism, but the ending feels more conceptual than viscerally satisfying, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality in combining crosswords with historical secrets, some metaphors feel slightly generic, and emotional portrayal leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing, hinting at a lack of distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength, limiting depth.</comment>
