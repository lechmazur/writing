<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Sister Margot's drive to honor old promises and challenge dogma, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "blunt heretic" label; reactions to the teddy bear feel slightly forced rather than revealing nuanced layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit; the battle through codes drives the story, though some logical connections between ticker messages and responses are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the forgotten library in a deserted temple is evocative and complements the tone of anxious elation; sensory details like dust motes and moonlight are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on faith and doubt with a satisfying ending, and symbolism of the teddy bear adds subtext; however, emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying on stated feelings rather than deeply shown nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in blending theological paradoxes with a stock ticker, but metaphors like "cold sunrise" feel generic; emotional handling lacks subtlety, and the narrative occasionally follows predictable heretic-redemption tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering depth or truly provocative thought beyond the explicit theme of faith and doubt.</comment>
