<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the mage's drive to break a family curse, but her compassionate nature feels underdeveloped and secondary to the plot's demands; her distinct voice is present but not fully realized in dialogue or internal thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the submarine's history and the curse's resolution lacks deeper causal clarity within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The submarine as an intelligence center is vividly rendered with sensory details like cold steel and groaning hulls, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting's connection to the curse feels slightly contrived despite supporting the mood of mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and offers subtext about time and memory, with a satisfying ending, but relies too heavily on telling over showing for emotional depth; dialogue is purposeful but lacks natural flow at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise with the submarine-curse nexus, some metaphors (e.g., curse shattering like glass) are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced through subtext or action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, leaving a lingering question about time's nonlinearity, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
