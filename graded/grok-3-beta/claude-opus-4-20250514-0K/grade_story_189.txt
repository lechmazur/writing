<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode star maps is clear, but the apprentice's personality feels underdeveloped beyond being "bright-eyed"; lacks a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained, though some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the haunted lighthouse basement is vividly realized with sensory details like phosphorescent moss and dripping seawater, enhancing atmosphere; tone aligns well with the concept, though some details feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes hope and curiosity through its ending, with strong imagery and subtext about renewal, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level; conflict is present but not deeply explored within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Original in combining cosmic navigation with post-apocalyptic tech, but relies on familiar tropes of ghostly guidance and hidden knowledge without fully subverting them; metaphors are fresh, though some phrasing borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of possibility; however, style occasionally prioritizes flair over clarity, and depth is constrained by length, feeling more like a sketch than a fully realized piece.</comment>
