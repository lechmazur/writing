<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's peculiarity as a collector is well-defined, and her infuriating calmness aligns with her patient preservation over millennia, but her deeper emotional layers and distinct voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a compelling convergence point, and the decoding action drives the narrative effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension build-up within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Probability Mapping Center and millennia-spanning timeframe create a vivid, unique backdrop that enhances the concept of buried talents; sensory details are evocative but sparse, slightly limiting immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining temporal concepts with buried talents, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "desert flowers after rain") are slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought on potential; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity over depth.</comment>
