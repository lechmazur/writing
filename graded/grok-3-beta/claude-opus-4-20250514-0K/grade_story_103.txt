<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The knight's weathered nature and internal conflict over duty versus love are well-portrayed, with clear motivation driving his return to the lighthouse. However, his emotional transformation feels slightly rushed within the word limit, lacking deeper nuance in his internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the knight's confrontation with his past. Pacing is adequate but feels slightly compressed, and the resolution, while poignant, lacks a fully fleshed-out buildup due to the word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is evocatively grim, enhancing the story's tone of regret and isolation. Sensory details like the storm-darkened tower and brass knocker are vivid, though some opportunities for deeper atmospheric immersion (e.g., sounds of the sea) are missed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through the knight's reconciliation with his daughter's memory, with effective symbolism in the mirror and items. However, the dialogue, while moving, feels slightly stilted, and the theme of forgiveness, while clear, could be layered with more subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique take on regret and forgiveness, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some imagery (e.g., "mocking sun") feels familiar. Emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the style, while distinct, doesn't fully break new ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story coheres well despite multiple elements, with a lingering emotional impact. The brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, and while creative in concept, the execution lacks the polish for top-tier immediacy in a competitive market.</comment>
