<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's portrayal as a bluffing swindler with an "energetically lethargic" demeanor is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to expose truth is clear, yet his inner conflict and voice lack depth for a truly compelling character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the computer restart driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the blank price tag and the resolution is more symbolic than logically coherent within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is vividly realized and enhances the atmosphere of nature overtaking human failure; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion in the post-collapse world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its themes of hidden guilt and justice, supported by symbolism like the blank price tag, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger emotional punch or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in its setting and concept of invisible allies, but relies on familiar tropes of a con artist seeking redemption without significant subversion; metaphors are fresh in places but occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels moderately cohesive with creative integration of elements like the orchard and price tag, but the brevity sometimes undermines depth; it leaves a faint lingering question about justice, though the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
