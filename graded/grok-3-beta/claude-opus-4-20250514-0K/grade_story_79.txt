<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elara's grief-driven resolve, but her personality lacks depth beyond the loss; her role as sheriff feels underutilized in shaping her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with heavy exposition slowing the middle, and the resolution lacks concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally obscures clarity; length feels like a limitation, and creative integration is strong but not fully realized.</comment>
