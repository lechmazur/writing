<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as an underestimated rebel is compelling, with clear motivation tied to saving a place of personal history, though her "sadly joyful" attribute feels slightly repetitive and underexplored in depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the shared cuisine and adaptation concept, but pacing feels slightly rushed toward the resolution, and the foreman's sudden change of heart lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like caramelized onions and fogged mirrors, enhancing the ephemeral gloom and supporting Mayaâ€™s mission, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through shared memory and meals, with strong imagery like fractured mirrors, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch; dialogue is minimal but effective, though subtext could be further layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining cuisine with adaptation in a haunted setting, but relies on the trope of a last-minute save without fully subverting it; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the pocket knife and shared meals, leaving a lingering sense of hope, though some stylistic choices and rushed pacing hinder clarity and depth.</comment>
