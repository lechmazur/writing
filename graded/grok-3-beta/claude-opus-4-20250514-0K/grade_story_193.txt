<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around loneliness is clear and drives actions, but the prince's personality lacks distinct depth beyond archetype; reactions to the mortar and pestle are evocative but not revelatory of unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a logical beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit; the snowstorm-driven encounter advances the story, though cause-effect links are predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly described with sensory details like snow and dust motes, enhancing mood; the customs office ties meaningfully to the tone of displacement, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through shared loneliness theme and uses symbolism effectively with the mortar and pestle; however, dialogue is sparse and lacks distinctiveness, and subtext is present but not profoundly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in the healing ritual, but emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; metaphors are functional but not strikingly fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly serving the narrative; brief length works as a deliberate vignette, though style occasionally leans on familiar phrasing, limiting lasting impact or deeper reflection.</comment>
