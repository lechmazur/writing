<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Marcus’s drive to instill empathy, but his personality feels underdeveloped; the “enthusiastic apathy” is stated rather than deeply shown through distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc and logical cause-effect with the butterfly’s role in prediction, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drought prediction center setting enhances the thematic drought of emotion, and the atmosphere of detached urgency complements the tone, though sensory details are sparse and could be more evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on empathy and climate through strong subtext, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and emotional impact relies more on telling (e.g., “I feel everything”) than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of musical memories in a butterfly is original, some metaphors (e.g., “drought began in our hearts”) feel clichéd, and emotional resonance leans on explicit statements rather than subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the butterfly, and it leaves a lingering thought on collective empathy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity.</comment>
