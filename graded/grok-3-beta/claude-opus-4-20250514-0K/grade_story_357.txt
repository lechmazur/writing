<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Margot's focus as a collector shapes her isolation and dedication to data, but her motivation shifts too abruptly during the party without deeper internal conflict or gradual change; her voice is distinct but lacks nuance in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the invitation driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the emotional climax; cause and effect are logical, though the board game’s revelations can feel forced and overly symbolic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frost giant’s lair is vividly realized and complements the tone of earnest flippancy; sensory details like warmth and ice walls enhance atmosphere, though smell and taste are underutilized; setting supports the concept well but could tie more directly to despair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on solitude versus isolation, with effective symbolism in the black rose and mirror maze; dialogue is purposeful but stiff at times; the ending is satisfying but lacks a sharper emotional punch; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique take on solitude with the game mechanic, avoiding blatant clichés, but leans on familiar fantasy tropes without subversion; metaphors are fresh but sparse; emotional handling shows nuance in places but often states rather than shows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative element integration, and the brief length suits the fable-like tone; it leaves a lingering thought on balance, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity at key moments.</comment>
