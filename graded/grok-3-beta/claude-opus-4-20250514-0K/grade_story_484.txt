<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to embody his values is clear, but his personality as a "uniquely generic" brewer feels underdeveloped, lacking depth beyond surface irony; his voice is distinct but leans on predictable hipster tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical descent into the cellar driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the protest backdrop adds little to plot coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting enhances the tone of flippant solemnity and complements the encroaching darkness concept; sensory details like moonlight on the mirror are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with Marcus's awakening, and symbolism of the mirror and graveyard is effective; however, the central conflict feels understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on a brewer's existential crisis, it leans on clich√©d hipster and craft beer tropes without fully subverting them; metaphors like "liquid pretension" are sharp but not groundbreaking, and emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels intentional; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
