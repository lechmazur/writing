<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's vendetta and precise creativity shape her actions convincingly, particularly in weaponizing her sugar art, but her deeper emotional layers and distinct voice remain underexplored within the word limit, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the trail of photographs driving discovery, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between counterattack and broader rebellion lacks full coherence under the tight constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the rebellious atmosphere effectively, with sensory details like crushed candy wrappers adding immersion, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly vague and underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes hope and defiance through symbolic sugar sculptures, with strong imagery, but the emotional impact is somewhat surface-level, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of rebellion through art is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., "burned hotter than molten caramel") feel slightly clich√©d, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown, reducing originality and authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres well with creative use of elements like sugar art as rebellion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
