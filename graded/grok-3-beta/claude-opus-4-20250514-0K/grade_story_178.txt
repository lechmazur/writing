<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Martha's overburdened nature is implied but lacks depth in portrayal; her motivation to cure the plague is clear but feels utilitarian rather than emotionally resonant. Her interaction with the stamps reveals little personal nuance, and her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is driven by the act of quantizing data through trivia night, which is inventive but unevenly executed within the word limit. The arc feels somewhat complete, though pacing is rushed toward the climax, and dimensional shifts occasionally disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The undersea greenhouse setting is vividly realized with sensory details like bioluminescent plankton and ocean pressure, enhancing the atmosphere of dissonant calm. However, the connection between setting and stamps feels tenuous, slightly undermining immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes intellectual curiosity about quantum realities but lacks deep emotional impact. Imagery and symbolism around stamps and infinite oceans are striking, yet the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying. Subtext exists but isn’t fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending quantum theory with stamps and trivia night, avoiding overt clichés. However, some sensory details are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, hinting at a lack of human nuance in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, though the stamps occasionally feel forced into the narrative. The style supports clarity, but the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice. It leaves a lingering question about reality, which is a strength.</comment>
