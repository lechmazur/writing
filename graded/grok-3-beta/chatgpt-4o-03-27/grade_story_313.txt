<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jasper’s portrayal as a con artist with an unusually normal face is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth beyond a vague desire for comfort and defiance; his voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but the pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between interrogating ghosts and seeking comfort is logical yet not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered with evocative details like gas-masked scarecrows and humming cows, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the timeframe of "story time" feels underexplored and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a haunting curiosity through Jasper’s interaction with ghosts, with strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., the tape dispenser as a relic of lies); yet, the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext or a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with ghosts and remorse, some metaphors (e.g., moths to a dying bulb) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the tape dispenser and ghostly interrogations, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly impactful one.</comment>
