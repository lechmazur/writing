<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thasselby’s old-fashioned mage persona is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and inconsistent; the shift to tenderness lacks grounding in prior characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the riddle’s unfolding drives the story, yet the cuddle resolution feels abrupt and under-explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
