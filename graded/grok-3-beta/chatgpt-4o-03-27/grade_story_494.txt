<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s transformation from arrogance to resolve is evident, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper insight into his internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at times; the connection between beginning and end is clear, yet the pacing struggles to balance introspection with action within the word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of harsh tenderness, with strong sensory details like ink-stained stones, though the timeframe’s integration feels more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through Kael’s transformation and uses potent imagery, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by over-reliance on telling over showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “world’s canvas”) feel generic; the narrative shows individual style but lacks consistent emotional nuance, occasionally stating feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style sometimes leans toward ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as sharply as it could.</comment>
