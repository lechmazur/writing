<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Felix’s naivety and gambling past are clear, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level regret; Professor Larkspur’s unpredictability feels more caricature than nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between beginning and end feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative and ties well to the atmosphere of isolation, with strong sensory details like turbine hums; however, the timeframe of candlelit dinners feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Felix’s longing, and the ending is somewhat satisfying; however, literary devices like symbolism of the candle mold are heavy-handed, and subtext is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of redemption and mysterious pasts without subversion; metaphors like “candlelight and madness” feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking deeper resonance.</comment>
