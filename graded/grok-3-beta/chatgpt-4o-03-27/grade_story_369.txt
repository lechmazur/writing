<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Emory's fanaticism as a puzzle maker is evident, but his deeper motivations and spiritual development goals feel underexplored, lacking emotional depth or specificity in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the connection between puzzles and secrets is intriguing but lacks a decisive resolution or escalation within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly described with sensory details like "slick with salt" and "whispering walls," enhancing the eerie atmosphere and complementing the tone of mystery effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (mirror, spiral) evoke thought, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper conflict resolution; the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of puzzles as confessions is original, some metaphors ("time wriggled like a trapped eel") feel slightly forced; emotional nuance is present but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth; it leaves a lingering mood but not a profound question.</comment>
