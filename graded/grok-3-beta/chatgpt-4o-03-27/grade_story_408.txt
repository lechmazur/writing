<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliasâ€™s portrayal as a conscientious objector is intriguing, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; his boredom and restlessness are stated rather than deeply explored through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the stormbird mapping as a central thread, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed transitions and underdeveloped connections between the orchard, watch, and birds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine is vividly described with strong sensory details (rotting fruit, buzzing flies), enhancing the melancholic atmosphere; however, the craft fair timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a haunting mood with effective imagery (stormbirds, moonlight), and the ending lingers, but the central conflict lacks sharpness; emotional depth is present but often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the stormbird concept offers originality, some metaphors (trees as mourners) feel overused; emotional resonance is inconsistent, with moments of stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the rusty nail and orchard, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
