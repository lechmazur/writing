<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Elias and Lys are intriguing with distinct motivations (tracking butterflies, decoding messages), but their development feels rushed and lacks depth due to the word limit; their romance, while poetic, emerges too abruptly to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning (Elias’s quest), middle (Lys’s connection), and end (decision to surface), but pacing feels uneven; the butterfly warning and surface conflict resolution are underdeveloped, leaving coherence slightly strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly realized with sensory details (groaning hull, brass pipes), enhancing the battered marvel tone and supporting the isolated, melancholic atmosphere; however, some connections between setting and butterflies feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the unconventional romance and hope for change, with strong imagery (bioluminescent wings, invisible ink); yet, the central conflict of surface storms feels underexplored, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers originality in combining steampunk with butterfly-coded messages, some metaphors (e.g., “heart stitched from regrets”) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the lingering impact is diminished by underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
