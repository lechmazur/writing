<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren’s portrayal as a faux fortune teller with real visions shapes her actions, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from fortune telling to teaching songs lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with exploration driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—key moments like breaking the seal are rushed, weakening cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Archive of Extinct Languages setting is evocative with strong sensory details (dust, parchment), enhancing the mood of rediscovery, though the timeframe of planting feels underexplored in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maren’s peaceful anger and uses vivid imagery (ivy strangling, air shimmering), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (dust dancing like spirits) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
