<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but his personality and "aggressively kind" attribute feel underdeveloped, lacking depth in how they shape his actions beyond a surface-level intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the whale's call and the dance; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the whistle's dissolution lacks sufficient buildup for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room and the ocean setting are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like salt air and whale calls, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery and memory; minor disconnect exists between the stage on the rocks and the lighthouse's isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a haunting emotional response through imagery and symbolism of the sea and dance as vessels of tradition; the ending is purposeful, but the lack of dialogue and occasional overt telling of emotions slightly diminishes impact.</comment>
