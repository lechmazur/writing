<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian’s fierce loyalty to the Order is evident, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation is clear but not nuanced, and his voice feels somewhat generic despite the unique context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between the outage and Elian’s transformation is logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and city outage create a striking atmosphere of sanctified dread; sensory details like dust and ozone are evocative, though the setting’s connection to the object feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its metaphor of balancing storms, with strong imagery and subtext; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a sharper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of coded comedy as radicalization is original, but some metaphors (moths around a flame) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
