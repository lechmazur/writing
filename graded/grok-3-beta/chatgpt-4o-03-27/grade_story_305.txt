<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's reticence is implied but not deeply explored; motivation to uncover truths via the tablet is clear but lacks emotional depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a ritualistic progression, but pacing feels uneven; the connection between sketches and echoes is intriguing yet underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the flooded opera house is vividly rendered with sensory details like water and lantern light, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and supporting the concept of echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity through symbolism (cake, sketches) and subtext about complacency, but emotional impact is muted; ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like echoes and sketches, but metaphors (half-baked cake) feel slightly forced; tone is consistent but lacks distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering idea of rebellion, though not powerfully.</comment>
