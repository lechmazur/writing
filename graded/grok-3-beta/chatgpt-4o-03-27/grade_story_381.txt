<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems is clear, but the hushed necromancer's personality lacks depth beyond nostalgia; reactions to the baseball cap and old movies feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the action of mapping via resolve's sound is logical yet underexplored in its impact on the narrative's tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like phosphorescent light and harmonic vibrations, enhancing atmosphere; however, the futuristic timeframe "between sets" feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through nostalgia and loss, with some effective imagery (crystal projections), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending is satisfying but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining necromancy with cartography and nostalgia, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "veins" of caves) are predictable; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking subtle nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like old movies and resolve's sound, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought of memory's power, though not profoundly so.</comment>
