<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s motivation for vengeance is clear and tied to his sister’s disappearance, but his transition from vendetta to hope feels abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance in reaction to the locket and photographs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the trail of photographs driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks depth, leaving cause-effect relationships somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is evocative with strong sensory details like rusted lanterns and whispers of ghosts, enhancing the tone of ardent scorn, though the connection between setting and hidden continent feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elian’s grief and hope, with effective imagery like “candied vengeance,” but the ending feels more poetic than satisfying, and subtext is present but not fully layered or explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a candy sculptor is unique, some metaphors like “pendulums of memory” feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable rebellion tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the locket and photographs, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking deeper lingering impact.</comment>
