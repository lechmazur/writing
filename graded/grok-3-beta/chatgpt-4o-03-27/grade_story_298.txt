<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wen’s rationally impulsive nature is intriguing and shapes his obsessive pursuit of Lian’s mystery, but his motivations lack deeper personal stakes or internal conflict, making his character feel somewhat surface-level despite the unique chameleon trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Wen’s performance as a climax, but the pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between solving mysteries and emotional reproduction is conceptually interesting yet underdeveloped, leading to minor coherence gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Chinese palace and post-oil timeframe blend effectively, with vivid imagery like sunlight through debris enhancing the mood; however, sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism (the doll’s dress, sunlight) effectively, with a satisfying ending; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a chameleon actor solving mysteries is original, some metaphors (e.g., “garden of a world learning to feel”) feel generic, and emotional descriptions occasionally lack nuance, hinting at formulaic tendencies; still, the narrative avoids overt clichés.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice for impact.</comment>
