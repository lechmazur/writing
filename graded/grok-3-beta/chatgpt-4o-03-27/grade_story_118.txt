<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Agent Lira’s motivation to anchor her past is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond guilt; Echo-9’s peculiarity is intriguing but underdeveloped in voice and impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the wax-dripping method driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret agent facility and night-time setting enhance the eerie tone, with strong sensory details like wax and ozone, though the connection between setting and object feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lira’s guilt and uses symbolism effectively with wax shapes, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and the theme of resilience lacks sharper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the hive-mind therapist offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “voice cracking like old vinyl”) feel clichéd, and emotional resonance relies too much on stated regret rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity limits deeper impact, though it leaves a lingering sense of melancholy.</comment>
