<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and consistent, but the "factually imaginative" attribute feels underexplored in shaping distinct personality or voice; reactions to the handkerchief are poignant yet lack deeper personal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit; the hopscotch method drives the plot creatively, though some cause-effect links are tenuous and abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the writing system archive is evocative and enhances the theme of preservation with strong sensory details like ink and ash; atmosphere supports mournful elation, though timeframe integration feels slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through themes of memory and loss, with effective symbolism in the handkerchief and hopscotch; ending is satisfying, but subtext is occasionally heavy-handed, and conflict resolution feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the hopscotch cipher concept, but some metaphors (e.g., snowflake silences) feel overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet tone shifts slightly with overly ornate language at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought on cultural preservation; however, style occasionally prioritizes flourish over clarity, and brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
