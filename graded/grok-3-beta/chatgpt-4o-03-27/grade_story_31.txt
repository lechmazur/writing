<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct with clear motivations (orchardist’s solitude and child’s curiosity), but development feels surface-level within the word limit; their emotional depth lacks nuanced progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet transitions are abrupt, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of a cyberpunk rooftop garden is vividly rendered with sensory details (neon skyline, drones humming), enhancing atmosphere; however, integration with timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a subtle emotional response through themes of connection, with effective imagery (roots, servers); ending is satisfying but lacks a deeper punch; dialogue feels purposeful yet slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining cyberpunk with organic imagery, but metaphors like “city’s heart” feel somewhat clichéd; emotional resonance is present but not fully nuanced, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought on connection; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
