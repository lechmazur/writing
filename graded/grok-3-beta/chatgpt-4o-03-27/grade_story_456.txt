<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlow’s identity as a morbid florist shapes his introspective nature, but his motivation to understand cosmic cycles feels slightly disconnected from his trade; more depth in linking his past to his current quest would strengthen his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a contemplative arc within the word limit, but the action of obliging the universe feels abstract and lacks a concrete climactic moment, leaving the resolution somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and cosmic imagery create a striking, ethereal atmosphere that enhances the tone, though sensory details are sparse and could further ground the surreal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (flowers as questions, stars as cycles) evokes thought, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of visceral character reaction; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist in a cosmic dojo is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “petal on the breath of eternity”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its assigned elements with creative intent, but the abstract style slightly hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering question of meaning, though not a deeply emotional imprint.</comment>
