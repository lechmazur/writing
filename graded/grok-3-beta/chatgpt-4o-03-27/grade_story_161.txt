<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Malcolm's vigilance and punctuality are clear, but his motivations feel slightly underdeveloped; the personal tragedy drives him, yet his emotional depth remains surface-level, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the conspiracy concept, though pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like Rourke’s reaction) are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is vividly rendered and complements the conspiracy tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully deepen Malcolm’s grief or obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue and has symbolic potential with the peacock patterns, but the emotional impact is muted; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering resonance or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like paper planes and pesticide conspiracies, but some metaphors (e.g., paper cult) feel forced, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a mild impression but lacks profound depth or lingering questions.</comment>
