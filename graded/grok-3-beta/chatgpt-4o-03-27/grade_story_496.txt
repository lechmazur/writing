<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliot's portrayal as a repressed poet is clear, and his lingering doubts shape his hesitancy, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual growth within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven; the ambush of vision, while striking, disrupts the flow, and the spontaneous decision to explore feels underexplored as a catalyst.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like ivy rustling and moss-covered pavement, enhancing the atmosphere of forgotten beauty; however, the initial corridor setting is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Eliot’s recognition and release, with strong imagery and symbolism (mural, perfume bottle), but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper lingering impact or deeper subtext within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its poetic tone and unique setting, with fresh metaphors like “perfume of memory,” but occasionally leans on ornate language that borders on purple prose, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the perfume bottle and overgrown street, but the brief length sometimes hinders depth; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not as profound as top-tier work demands.</comment>
