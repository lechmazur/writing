<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elric’s awkwardness as a champion is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to create a philosophy feels abstract and lacks personal grounding, diminishing emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a clear arc, but pacing feels uneven, with the climax of the thunderstorm release rushed compared to the drawn-out setup of doodling and baking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is vividly realized with sensory details like the hum and glass imagery, enhancing the atmosphere of warped chronology and supporting Elric’s contemplative mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is original with fresh metaphors like the thunderstorm in a bottle, some imagery feels ornate and verges on purple prose, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like baking and doodles, but the overly abstract style occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
