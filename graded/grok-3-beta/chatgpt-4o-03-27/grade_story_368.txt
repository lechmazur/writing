<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lio's streetwise nature is evident in his survival instincts and skepticism of curses, but his deeper emotional transformation feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the brooch's impact, and some cause-effect links are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lost orchard temple is vividly rendered with sensory details like overripe figs and dew-laden vines, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the timeframe's integration feels less grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (fruit as memories, brooch as key) evoke emotion and subtext, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the central conflict feels underexplored within constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers some fresh imagery, it leans on familiar tropes of cursed artifacts and hidden temples without significant subversion; emotional depth is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate at key emotional beats.</comment>
