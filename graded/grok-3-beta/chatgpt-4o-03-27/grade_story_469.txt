<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elian’s drive to map tunnels tied to his sister’s disappearance, but his "blameless" nature feels underexplored and somewhat idealized, lacking depth in conflict or moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed toward the end, and the connection between overreaching and the final success is not fully developed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and sensory details like the scent of jasmine create a vivid atmosphere that enhances the mood and supports Elian’s journey, though the timeframe’s urgency is inconsistently felt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Elian’s restrained grief and uses imagery effectively, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements, metaphors like “echoes carried secrets” feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is present but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
