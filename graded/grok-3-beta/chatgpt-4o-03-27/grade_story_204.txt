<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s role as a professional cuddler is intriguing and shapes her actions, particularly in the climactic embrace, but her motivation to overcome prejudice feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper internal conflict or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the connection between the phantom punch and the resolution feels somewhat forced; pacing is uneven, with the emotional shift rushed at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly described with evocative sensory details like rust and ozone, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and memory; the tone of ancient novelty complements the setting, though the timeframe’s impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mira’s prejudice dissolving, with strong imagery like “crumbling like old circuitry”; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict’s resolution lacks a sharper punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler and synthetic souls offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “eyes like eclipses”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the phantom punch, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of connection, though not powerfully so.</comment>
