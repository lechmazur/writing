<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jalen’s motivation to understand loss through cosmic balance is clear, and his softly militant resolve shapes his quiet determination, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single trait, and his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning tied to loss and an end focused on understanding, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between scouring attics and cosmic mapping is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is evocative and complements the tone of reluctant awe, with sensory details like brittle leaves and skeletal skyscrapers enhancing mood, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses imagery effectively, like stars as indifferent gods, but the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying, and the central conflict of loss lacks sharp tension within the brief narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique perspective on loss through cosmic mapping, some metaphors like “graveyard of ambition” feel familiar, and emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans toward overwrought imagery, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
