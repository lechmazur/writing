<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the woodsman’s pursuit of truth after his mother’s death, but his personality lacks depth beyond stoic determination; the antique hairbrush connection to his mother feels sentimental but underdeveloped in revealing nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning tied to loss and an ending of resolve, but pacing feels rushed in the tunnel discovery; cause and effect are logical, though the short-circuit action feels slightly contrived within the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the radio wave garden is evocative with strong sensory details like ozone and static, enhancing the mood of loss and mystery; atmosphere supports the tone of despairing cheer, though the hospital timeframe integration feels slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of honesty and loss, with decent imagery like “iron flowers,” but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending is purposeful but not striking, and conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements like the hairbrush and short-circuit, but metaphors like “tracks beneath boots” are overused; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and tone shifts slightly with uneven despair and cheer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but style occasionally leans on clichéd imagery; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, though it leaves a lingering sense of unresolved truth-seeking.</comment>
