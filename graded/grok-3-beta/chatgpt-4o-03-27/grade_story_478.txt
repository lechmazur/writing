<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eira’s critical nature as a midwife is evident in her skeptical approach, but her motivation to recover memories feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance; her voice is distinct yet not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between actions and outcomes is occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orchard island and maelstrom create a striking atmosphere of dissonant calm, enhanced by sensory details like the scent of charred paper; however, the setting’s integration with character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood with strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., fruit as faces), and the theme of remembrance is clear, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext and a somewhat predictable resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers some originality in its imagery, the metaphors (e.g., memories as buried) are not entirely fresh, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
