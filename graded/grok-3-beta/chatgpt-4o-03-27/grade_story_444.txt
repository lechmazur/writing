<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambassador Lira's fierce determination and methodically playful nature are evident, but her deeper personality and backstory feel underdeveloped within the word limit; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth beyond the symbolic costume.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at times; the action of indoctrination drives the story, yet connections between events can feel abrupt due to the tight word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of decay and rebirth; sensory details like radio static and rusted ribs are effective, though some tonal consistency is lost in overly poetic flourishes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through shared dreams and memory, with strong imagery and symbolism; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like the ghost costume and shared dreams, but some metaphors (e.g., "drowned in fantasies") feel overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet lacks deeper nuance in character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
