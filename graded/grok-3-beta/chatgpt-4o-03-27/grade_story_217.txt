<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Julesâ€™ need to reconnect and adapt, but the "underestimated rebel" trait feels underdeveloped and lacks distinct voice or actions to fully embody it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolutions; the connection between past and present lacks deeper causality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through shared meals and memories, with strong imagery, but the ending feels slightly predictable and lacks a sharper central conflict for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of haunted pasts and redemption without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the knife and cuisine, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
