<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and transformative end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the demolition's integration feels slightly forced within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quantum beach setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of corroded rapture; the mood strongly supports the theme, though the condemned building feels underutilized in the sensory landscape.</comment>
