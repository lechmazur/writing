<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s reluctance as a caretaker and analytical playfulness are well-integrated into his actions, but his deeper emotional transformation lacks nuance; his shift to purpose feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the dragon tooth and orchard curse resolution is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard setting and sunrise timeframe create a haunting atmosphere with vivid sensory details like dew and whispers, though the futuristic hub feels tacked on and underutilized in enhancing mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the orchard’s lament and uses strong imagery, but the ending feels overly neat, and the theme of grief, while present, lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the dragon-orchard concept offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “whispers like smoke”) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the dragon tooth, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
