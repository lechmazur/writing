<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ava's portrayal as a lost heiress is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to uncover her father's fate is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the concept of fragmented reality driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like ozone and alien flora, enhancing the atmosphere of fractured reality, though the cloud migration timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Ava's journey, with some effective imagery (clouds migrating, reality layered), but the ending feels abrupt, and subtext is present yet not fully layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fragmented reality offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., clouds like thoughts) feel overused, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the parking stub, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
