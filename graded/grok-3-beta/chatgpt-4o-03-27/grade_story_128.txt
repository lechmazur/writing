<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tariq’s fretfulness and hesitancy are portrayed, but his transition to boldness feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation; his voice is not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with storytelling driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the method of decoding via TV subtitles disrupts coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Egyptian palace setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and object (recipe) feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Tariq’s journey and uses imagery effectively, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the theme of storytelling’s power feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the metaphors (e.g., sand in wind) are somewhat generic, and the method of TV subtitles feels forced and inorganic, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
