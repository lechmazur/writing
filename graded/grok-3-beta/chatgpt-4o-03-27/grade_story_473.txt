<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s eccentricity and motivations are intriguing, but his inner conflict and growth feel underdeveloped; Elia’s arc shows promise but lacks depth due to limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with Thorne passing leadership to Elia, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard under solar panels is vividly realized with strong sensory detail, enhancing the bittersweet tone, though the setting’s full potential to reflect character struggles is underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original imagery and concept avoid clichés, with fresh metaphors, though some emotional beats lack nuanced showing, and the style occasionally veers into ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting depth; leaves a lingering thought but not a profound one.</comment>
