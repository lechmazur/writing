<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rell’s motivation to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt is intriguing and ties to his loss, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; his actions align with motivation but feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from obsession to acceptance is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the black hole concept’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory enhances the gritty whimsy and isolation, with evocative sensory details like creaking and humming; however, the setting’s connection to the sea glass feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of loss and clarity, with strong imagery like the void bending memory; yet, the ending feels slightly pat, and the theme of loss as a lens lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a black hole of doubt is original, some metaphors (e.g., stars blinking like tired eyes) are overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the sea glass, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
