<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eira’s frazzled nature and weak resolve are portrayed, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and her transformation lacks depth; her voice is indistinct, missing a personal edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with levitation as a pivotal action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between courage strands and social change are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Celtic village with neon and runes creates a striking atmosphere, enhancing the tone of jubilant despair; sensory details are present but uneven, lacking in some key moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Eira’s reunion and purpose, with decent imagery, but the theme of transformation feels surface-level; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the blend of modernity and myth shows originality, some metaphors are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown; the narrative avoids major clichés but lacks a truly unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
