<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Cale’s quest for forgiveness tied to his family’s flaws, but his personality as a "cheerless duelist" feels underdeveloped, lacking distinct voice or actions that reflect this trait beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between elasticizing broth and forgiveness is conceptually intriguing yet logically strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly described with sensory details like ozone and server hum, enhancing the bittersweet tone, though the connection between setting and the maggoty chest feels somewhat incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through Cale’s reckoning and uses strong imagery like the fractured reflection, but the theme of forgiveness is heavy-handed at times, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch due to overt messaging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of recipes as weapons is original, some metaphors (e.g., "broken promise" scar) feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like recipes and spaceports, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
