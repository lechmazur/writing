<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliot’s social awkwardness is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to rebuild from regret feels surface-level and lacks specificity in emotional depth or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the action of reaping regret and the method of reversed trails feels abstract and underdeveloped; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-night timeframe create a strong, melancholic atmosphere with vivid sensory details like buzzing lights and greasy windows; however, the encrypted archive feels slightly disconnected from the diner’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through regret and possibility, with decent use of symbolism (whistle as cipher), but the ending lacks punch, and the conflict feels more conceptual than visceral; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story shows originality in combining espionage archives with personal regret, and metaphors like “tree of regret” are fresh, but some emotional descriptions lean on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; tone remains mostly consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone, but it lacks a lingering, profound impact or deeper clarity in its central idea; style is evocative yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
