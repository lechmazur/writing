<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Milo's aloofness is present but underdeveloped; his transformation from detachment to courage feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation, missing nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the anomaly and stones driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as a setting is evocative and ties well to the mood of mystery, enhanced by sensory details like the hum, though other sensory elements are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with Milo's transformation, and imagery like "tunnel of bending light" is striking, but subtext is shallow, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the anomaly offers some originality, the orphan trope and fear-to-courage arc are clich√©d without subversion; metaphors like "velvet glove" feel generic, lacking unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, but the style lacks polish, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, missing deeper impact.</comment>
