<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>King Orlen's unassuming nature and motivation to cradle wisdom are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the symbolic; reactions to the puzzle and feather are intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete despite a contemplative resolution; pacing is uneven with a rushed internal shift, though the ember of choice concept drives the narrative with moderate coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The acid rain forest is vividly realized with sensory details like hissing droplets and steaming underbrush, enhancing mood and supporting the tone of prickly wonder, though setting-character connection could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (puzzle as choice, ember as hope) evoke reflection, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks a sharper conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original elements like the feather's texture as perception stand out, but some metaphors (e.g., "sacred fire") feel generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though depth feels constrained by brevity.</comment>
