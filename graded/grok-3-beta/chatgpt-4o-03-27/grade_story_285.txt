<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s hesitation and awkwardness are portrayed consistently, shaping his internal conflict, but his motivation to restore traditional systems feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of emerging driving the resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more symbolic than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of ephemeral rancor; sensory details are strong, though the setting’s connection to the postcard feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its themes of silence and restoration, with effective symbolism in the postcard and bridge, but the dialogue is minimal and lacks natural flow; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on bridging worlds, some metaphors (e.g., hermit crabs) feel forced and generic; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
