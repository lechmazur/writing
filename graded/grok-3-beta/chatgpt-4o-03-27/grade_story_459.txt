<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliot’s motivation to find liberation in letting go is clear and ties to his ghost-seeing ability, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond this trait, lacking a distinct voice or deeper nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between staking out ghost tours and the main action is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is vividly described with sensory details like salt-stained glass and humming dehumidifiers, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the lunchtime timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the ghost’s interaction and Eliot’s shift, with effective imagery like the collapsing cathedral, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the theme of letting go is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers some originality in the setting and concept, metaphors like “silence louder than a scream” feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated shifts than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the dried flower crown and sand lab, leaving a lingering sense of peace, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
