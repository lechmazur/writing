<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Jori’s transformation from isolated to connected, but his analytically unpredictable nature feels underexplored and inconsistent with his tender actions; motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the connection between tracking moon trails and the emotional shift is tenuous, lacking stronger cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the nomad caravan during spring cleaning is vividly rendered with sensory details like dust and star quilts, enhancing atmosphere; tone of joyful sorrow aligns well, though some details feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through Jori’s interaction with the child and subtle symbolism of thread, but the ending feels slightly predictable; writing shows craft, though subtext could be deeper and conflict more pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., stitching the heart) are familiar; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown; style is distinct but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but brevity sometimes limits depth; creative combination of elements is evident, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
