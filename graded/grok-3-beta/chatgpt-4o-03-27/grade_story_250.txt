<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's bluntness and heretical nature are evident, but motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the emotional connection to the sister is clear, yet the transition from heretic to seeker lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the stock ticker and resolution is intriguing yet not fully logical or seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the forgotten library is vividly rendered with strong sensory details; atmosphere of anxious elation complements the tone, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the sisterâ€™s memory and teddy bear symbolism; ending is satisfying, but some telling over showing in emotional beats diminishes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in combining tech (stock ticker) with mysticism, but reliance on familiar lost-sibling trope and slightly generic descriptors for emotion prevent higher marks; style is distinct yet not fully polished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering emotional note; however, brevity sometimes hinders depth, and style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
