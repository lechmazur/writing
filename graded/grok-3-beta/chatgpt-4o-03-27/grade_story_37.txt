<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the flame's revival, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the waiting room and rainforest lacks seamless integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly described with bioluminescent vines, enhancing the mystical atmosphere, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sight and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of nostalgia and hope through the lullaby, with strong imagery, but the ending feels slightly unresolved, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a con artist guarding a mystical flame is original, some metaphors (e.g., "fog to a cloud") feel overused, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the sheet music and yodeling, but the dual settings dilute focus, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
