<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s feisty nature and past as a stablehand are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve ancient methods feels clear but lacks depth in execution, missing a stronger emotional tie to her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with morphing the lamp as a central action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The space debris art studio is vividly realized with sensory details like ozone and rust, enhancing the atmosphere of redemption, though the car rides feel underexplored as a timeframe element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Mira’s persistence, with effective imagery like the lamp-horse catching starlight, but lacks deeper subtext or a strong central conflict within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a cosmic scavenger is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., stars as neon signs) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated memories than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
