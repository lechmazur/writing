<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "loudly introverted" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation for reunion with courage feels clear yet lacks depth in execution due to limited internal conflict or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between meandering and the core concept of courage is tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Neon cathedral setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of crooked hope; however, the timeframe's integration feels more implied than impactful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the motherâ€™s song and symbolism of fireflies, with a satisfying ending; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and subtext, while present, lacks sharper focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors are fresh in places (e.g., "neon scripture"), but some phrases verge on purple prose; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet the narrative leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative; style supports clarity, but the brief length feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate, limiting deeper exploration.</comment>
