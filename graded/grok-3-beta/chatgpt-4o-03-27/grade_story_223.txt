<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Calder Vane’s seasickness and awkward charm are present but underexplored; his motivation to confront the Mirror is clear, but his personality lacks depth in shaping his actions beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between traded secrets and the Mirror’s lies lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon are vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing the atmosphere, though the timeframe of centuries feels loosely integrated with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism with the ghost orchid and Mirror, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by telling over showing, and the central conflict lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh in places, but some metaphors (e.g., “wound in the world”) feel overused; emotional handling is nuanced at times but occasionally stated directly, missing deeper human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
