<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s grumpiness is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to quell inner trauma is clear but lacks nuanced development within the word limit. His reaction to the cardboard tube and obsidian shard reveals past pain, though his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the action of jiggling the mandala drives the story but isn’t fully logical in its impact. Cause and effect are mostly clear, though pacing stumbles with dense exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witch’s crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that enhances the mystical tone. Sensory details like shimmering sand and starlight are evocative, though some connections between setting and object feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through trauma’s portrayal and uses strong imagery (sand vortex, starlit eyes), but the ending feels slightly pat. Subtext around trauma as a crucible is present, though dialogue from the witch feels expository rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (storm settling, crucible of trauma) feel familiar rather than fresh. Emotional resonance is shown more than told, but the style lacks a truly unique voice, and some descriptors are slightly generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, though some (like the cardboard tube) feel ancillary. The brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
