<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jaro’s confidence as a watchman is evident, but his inner yearning and envy feel somewhat underdeveloped, lacking deeper exploration of how these traits shape his actions beyond the surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but the pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between mobilizing thoughts and the fingerprint method is intriguing yet not fully logical or integrated into the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The giant beehive interior is vividly described and complements the tone of yearning, with sensory details like waxen floors enhancing immersion; however, the setting’s connection to the cracked ruler feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Jaro’s transformation and uses symbolism effectively (fingerprints as longing), but the dialogue is minimal and lacks depth; the theme of self-discovery is present but not profoundly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fingerprints as maps of longing is original, some metaphors (e.g., “honeyed innocence”) feel clichéd; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the beehive and fingerprints, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
