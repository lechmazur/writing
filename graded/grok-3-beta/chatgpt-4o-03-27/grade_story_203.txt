<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing with the exorcist’s stage fright and unusual nature shaping her internal conflict, but motivation feels slightly abstract and reactions to revelations lack deeper emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven—revelations are rushed, and the connection between toy assembly and plot progression is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, complemented by sensory details like the sound of the lock; however, the timeframe of toy assembly feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes reflection through themes of truth and reinvention, with strong symbolism in the phoenix toy, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-telling rather than showing, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique setting and concept of an exorcist in space, but some metaphors (e.g., “theater of shadows”) feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative integration of elements and leaves a lingering sense of transformation, but uneven pacing and occasional lack of emotional depth prevent it from reaching top-tier publishability.</comment>
