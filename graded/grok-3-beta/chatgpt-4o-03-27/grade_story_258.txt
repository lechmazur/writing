<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Javi’s motivation to preserve indigenous dances is clear, but his characterization as a nimble locksmith feels underdeveloped; the attribute doesn’t significantly shape his actions or personality beyond a vague dexterity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the action of prancing could be more integral to driving tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the mystical atmosphere, though the timeframe of the final leaf dropping feels more symbolic than integral to the mood or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of loss and recovery through strong imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by overt exposition; the theme of memory is clear but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of a floating orchard and memory preservation is original, some metaphors (e.g., “storm of secrets”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity and immediate publishability.</comment>
