<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Svala’s motivation to archive emotional patterns is intriguing and distinct, but her personality lacks depth beyond enigmatic traits; her reactions to the wine merchant feel somewhat predictable, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the unspoken offer driving subtle tension, but pacing feels uneven—key emotional shifts are rushed, and the resolution lacks a stronger causal link to prior events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Viking longhouse and overlooked era blend effectively, creating a unique atmosphere; sensory details like amber light and wine taste enhance mood, though some descriptions (e.g., wind whispering) are clichéd.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through subtext and the unspoken offer, with strong imagery (ink pulsing, zigzag script), but the ending feels slightly underwhelming, lacking a sharper lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of archiving emotions is original, some metaphors (e.g., “silence that sang”) feel overused; emotional handling shows nuance in silences but occasionally states feelings directly, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and overall impact.</comment>
