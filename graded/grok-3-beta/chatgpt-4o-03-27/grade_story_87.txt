<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marla’s patience as a librarian is evident in her methodical actions, but her motivation to bury hatred feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper insight into her emotional transformation. Her hyperactively serene attribute is intriguing but inconsistently reflected in her behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of closure within the word limit, but the pacing feels uneven, with the act of placing stickers dragging slightly. The connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a stronger emotional arc to tie it together.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly described with sensory details like gears and gaslight, enhancing the atmosphere of memory and loss. However, the setting’s connection to the stickers feels tenuous, slightly undermining its full potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response through Marla’s act of letting go, with effective symbolism in the stickers. Yet, the emotional depth remains surface-level, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly resonant punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “hollowed her out”) feel overused. The writing shows style, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly surprising twist or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like stickers and mixtapes, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering feeling of release, though not profoundly memorable.</comment>
