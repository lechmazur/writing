<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alaric’s confusion as a diplomat is well-integrated into his internal conflict, but his motivations lack depth beyond a generic quest for clarity; his reactions to the spare key and village interactions feel somewhat surface-level, missing a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from conflict to resolution is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the action of liberalizing governance drives the story, but cause-effect links between Alaric’s realizations and actions are underdeveloped, leading to a slightly disjointed flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine village is vividly rendered with sensory details like whispering walls, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the connection between the setting and the spare key feels tenuous, slightly undermining the world’s cohesion with the narrative’s core elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Alaric’s epiphany and the joyfully tragic tone, with strong symbolism in the salt sculpture and bird patterns; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a fully satisfying punch due to rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective on diplomacy as a dance, some metaphors (e.g., evolutionary wisdom in birds) feel overused and lack freshness; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is notable but not profound.</comment>
