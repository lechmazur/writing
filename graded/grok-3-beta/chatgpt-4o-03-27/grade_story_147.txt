<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, driven by interpreting wind chime melodies, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The puppet master’s workshop and the haunting atmosphere of rust and gold are vividly rendered with strong sensory details like varnish and creaking swings, enhancing the mood, though the playground swing feels slightly disconnected from the core setting.</comment>
