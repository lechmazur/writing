<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing with Cassian’s duality as a dueling philosopher and fugitive, but his inner conflict and voice lack depth and distinctiveness; the mechanical arm feels underutilized in shaping personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between deconstructing the sock and the revelation lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like salt-laced air and fractured light, strongly enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone of coded desperation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through thematic depth of equilibrium as becoming, with strong use of metaphor, but emotional resonance is muted by over-telling rather than showing Cassian’s pain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a sock as cipher is inventive, the narrative leans on ornate language and predictable philosophical binaries, lacking fresh emotional nuance or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the lighthouse and sock, but overly complex prose occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
