<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elira's literal nature is intriguing and shapes her decoding approach, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding; her reactions and voice are distinct but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with overcharging the beacon as a pivotal action, and the arc feels complete, but pacing is slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-water-war timeframe create a compelling, desolate atmosphere with strong sensory details like damp stone and salt winds, though the setting's connection to the phone booth key feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has a satisfying ending, with some imagery like phosphorescent ink standing out, but subtext is minimal, and the central conflict lacks emotional depth; it shows more than tells, yet impact feels restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding star maps in a haunted lighthouse is unique, some descriptors are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown; the narrative avoids clich√©s but lacks a truly fresh stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the phone booth key, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact; style supports clarity but isn't exceptional.</comment>
