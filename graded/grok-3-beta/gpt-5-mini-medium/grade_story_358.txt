<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to claim an uncharted frontier is intriguing but lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory; the old-fashioned mage's personality feels more atmospheric than distinct, limiting emotional connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in blending science and ritual, with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but overly complex style sometimes hinders clarity; lingering impact is present but weakened by ambiguous resolution.</comment>
