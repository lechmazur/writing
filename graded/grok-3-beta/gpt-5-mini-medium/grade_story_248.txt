<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character motivation for the unsteady sentinel feels vague and inconsistent; the "coyly furious" attribute is mentioned but lacks depth in shaping actions or personality beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but coherence suffers from abrupt shifts and unclear cause-effect links between prophecy and actions like reassembling letters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through imagery and metaphor, but emotional resonance is undermined by over-telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by overly ornate language and generic metaphors like "air to glass," suggesting purple prose; emotional handling lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with creative elements, but overly complex style hinders clarity, and the short length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
