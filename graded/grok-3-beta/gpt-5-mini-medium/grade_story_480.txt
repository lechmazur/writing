<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The social media exorcist is intriguing with a distinct concept, but the character's motivations and personality lack depth and specificity beyond the surface idea of "feeding curiosity with life's raw edge." Actions align with the method, yet the indifferent enthusiasm feels more like a stylistic choice than a fully realized trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous, with the action of reigniting ghosts via trending lacking clear cause-and-effect progression. Pacing is uneven, with overemphasis on descriptive tangents that disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and timeframe are evocative, with sensory details like dust motes and sodium light creating atmosphere. However, the setting’s connection to the action and character motivation feels underutilized, and the tone’s indifferent enthusiasm sometimes clashes with the mood of decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story prompts curiosity with its unique premise and metaphors like "comments as bones," but emotional impact is muted by detached narration. The ending offers mild satisfaction, yet lacks a strong central conflict or tension to anchor the narrative. Subtext is present but not fully developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, with fresh metaphors and an unconventional approach to exorcism. However, some descriptors feel generic ("humming backrooms"), and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity with dense imagery. The brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, and while it leaves a lingering thought, the depth is not fully realized for top-tier publication.</comment>
