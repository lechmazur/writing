<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for forgiveness is clear but lacks depth; the duelist's personality feels archetypal, with little distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the chest beyond guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels fragmented within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution and unclear cause-effect links between actions and outcomes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting is evocative with server hum and broken blinds, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the spaceport customs office feels underutilized in relation to the duelistâ€™s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through guilt and forgiveness, but imagery like "elasticize memory" feels forced; ending is purposeful yet lacks lasting impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable redemption tropes; metaphors like "snapped back like a worn tendon" are fresh but sparse, while emotional handling often states rather than shows nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but not exceptional; elements are integrated but feel somewhat forced, and the style leans toward overcomplexity, diminishing clarity and lasting resonance.</comment>
