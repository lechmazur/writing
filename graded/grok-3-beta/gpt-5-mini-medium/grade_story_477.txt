<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s grace and discipline are evident, and his motivation to escape suppression is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits, and his reactions feel somewhat mechanical, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with innovation driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some sections rush while others linger unnecessarily—and coherence is occasionally disrupted by overpacked imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like bird songs in air pockets, enhancing the atmosphere of refuge and ruin; however, the setting’s connection to the telescope feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its themes of individuality and resistance, with effective imagery and symbolism, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the conflict’s resolution feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors are generic (“oil into compositions”), and emotional resonance relies too often on stated feelings rather than shown nuance; still, the style shows glimmers of originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, and the brevity feels deliberate, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about individuality, though not powerfully so.</comment>
