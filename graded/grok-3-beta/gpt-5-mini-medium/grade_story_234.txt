<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing with the gentle swordsman’s paradoxical “faithfully unfaithful” nature, but motivation lacks depth; it’s poetic but unclear why he acts as he does, limiting emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure meanders without a strong arc; while poetic imagery ties beginning to end, the lack of a clear conflict or resolution within the tight word limit diminishes coherence and impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dinosaur skeleton museum at night creates a haunting, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details like bones arguing with shadows, enhancing the story’s mood and supporting the character’s introspective tone.</comment>
