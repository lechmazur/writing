<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of offloading knowledge is conceptually interesting but feels static, with no significant progression or stakes to drive narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned carnival prize redemption center is vividly described with sensory details, creating an elegant chaos that complements the tone; however, the connection to the timeframe of the unsent letter feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a reflective mood through imagery and symbolism, particularly with the stars and scarf, but lacks a strong central conflict or emotional resonance; the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying.</comment>
