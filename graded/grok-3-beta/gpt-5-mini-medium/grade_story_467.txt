<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the discovery of letters feels underwhelming as a resolution, and pacing is uneven with overly descriptive detours disrupting momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underwater library setting is vividly realized with sensory details like "pages sighed under silt," enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone of "earthbound flight" effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance with the childâ€™s promise, and imagery is strong, but lacks a clear central conflict or deeper subtext; ending feels poetic but not fully satisfying.</comment>
