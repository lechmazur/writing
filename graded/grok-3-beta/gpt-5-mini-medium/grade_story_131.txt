<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to transform fear into courage is clear and consistent with the aloof orphan trait, but emotional depth feels slightly surface-level; reactions to objects reveal detachment, yet lack a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible within the word limit with a subtle resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the gravitational anomaly drives the plot, though connections between actions and outcomes are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details like motor oil and rain, enhancing the tone of affectionate detachment; the gravitational anomaly integrates well with the garage setting, though its impact on mood feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and subtle emotional resonance through imagery and subtext like "adapt or perish," but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch; literary devices are effective, though conflict resolution feels understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the anomaly and stone ritual, but some metaphors (e.g., "obedient planets") feel slightly overused; emotional handling shows nuance, though occasional generic descriptors detract from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though style occasionally overcomplicates clarity.</comment>
