<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve folk medicines is clear, but the "angrily peaceful" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance; actions align with mission but lack a distinct personal voice or internal conflict to elevate portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; connections between marathon training and ghost train mapping are tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolutions; hacking playlists as a method drives the plot but lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park setting enhances eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details like camphor smells and rusted rails, effectively supporting tone; however, integration with marathon training timeframe feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through preservation theme and teapot symbolism, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable conflict; writing style is evocative yet overly ornate at times, and ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining ghost trains and herbal lore, but reliance on predictable "forgotten prodigy" trope without subversion; language occasionally feels formulaic with generic descriptors, and emotional handling lacks nuanced showing over telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent in playlist method, but feels forced in places; style is ambitious but hinders clarity with complexity; leaves a lingering thought on preservation, yet depth remains surface-level.</comment>
