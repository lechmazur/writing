<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly realized with sensory details like citrus and engine oil, enhancing the atmosphere; the setting supports the mood of longing, though the timeframe's "changing winds" feels more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
