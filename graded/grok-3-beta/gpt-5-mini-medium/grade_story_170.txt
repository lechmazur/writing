<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maris's free-spirited and academically artistic nature is evident in her cataloging and stitching, but her motivation to hush shame feels underdeveloped and somewhat abstract, lacking specific grounding in her actions or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong forward drive; the action of memorizing letters is repetitive and introspective, missing a clear arc or resolution within the tight word limit, though the thematic coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The coral restoration station is vividly rendered with sensory details like salt and glass-like tide, enhancing the atmosphere of longing and isolation, though the timeframe of the last stone feels underutilized in deepening the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (letters as wounds, stitches as promises) create emotional resonance, but the central conflict of doubt versus courage remains internal and lacks a tangible resolution, diminishing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the metaphors are often fresh, the emotional handling leans toward overt statement rather than nuanced showing; the style is ornate at times, bordering on purple prose, which detracts from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the introspective focus and ornate language hinder clarity; it leaves a lingering mood, yet feels constrained by length rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
