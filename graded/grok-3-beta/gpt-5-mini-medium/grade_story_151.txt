<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astronomer’s awe and rational-organic approach shape a distinct personality, and his motivation to topple the idol is clear, but his inner conflict lacks depth, feeling more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with the idol’s toppling as a climax, but pacing feels uneven—some imagery slows the progression, and the connection between cultivation and resolution is intellectually intriguing yet not fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a striking, evocative setting, enhanced by sensory details like frost and crystal shadows, though the timeframe’s emotional void feels underexplored, slightly disconnecting atmosphere from motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on fear and morality with strong symbolism (veil, idol), but the emotional impact is muted by abstract language; the ending plants a question effectively, yet lacks visceral resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like “grief stratified like sediment” are fresh, the story leans on ornate prose that borders on purple, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies despite creative intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative ambition, leaving a lingering question about fear’s aftermath, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
