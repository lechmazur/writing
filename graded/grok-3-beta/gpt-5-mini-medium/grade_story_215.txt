<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's inward sociability and rattled nature are intriguing but inconsistently developed; motivation to entwine science with wonder feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the postcard and puzzles driving action, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; some connections between elements like dance lessons and psychic research are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting of the psychic research facility is evocative and supports the concept, but sensory details are sparse; the dance lessons feel tacked on and disrupt atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has potential for wonder but lacks emotional depth or subtext; imagery like "fossilized confessions" is striking, yet overall impact is muted by telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining exorcism with psychic research, but reliance on puzzle-solving feels trope-heavy; metaphors are occasionally fresh, though emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style is uneven and length feels constrained rather than deliberate; lacks a lingering thought or profound impact.</comment>
