<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's social awkwardness is evident but underdeveloped; motivation to overcome regret is clear but lacks depth in execution, feeling more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with decryption driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed and the resolution lacks a definitive punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the diner and late-night timeframe enhances the mood of introspection; sensory details like static and neon flickering are evocative and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (tree of regret) and imagery adds depth, but emotional impact is muted by over-reliance on abstract language over visceral showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable introspection tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is present but not fully grounded in specific detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; lingering impact is present but not powerful enough for top-tier status.</comment>
