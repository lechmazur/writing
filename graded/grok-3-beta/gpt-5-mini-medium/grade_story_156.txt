<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The diplomat’s confusion and joyfully tragic nature are intriguing, but his motivation feels abstract and inconsistently tied to concrete actions; the spare computer key as a symbolic object lacks deeper personal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overemphasis on introspection; the action of liberalizing is conceptually clear but lacks tangible progression or conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine village is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the mood; however, the bus rides as a timeframe feel repetitive and underexplored in relation to the broader setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its evolutionary wisdom theme and has striking imagery (birds’ patterns), but the emotional impact is diluted by over-telling; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a sharp, memorable punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of evolutionary wisdom and bird patterns is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic metaphors and overly ornate language; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style often overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of communal learning, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
