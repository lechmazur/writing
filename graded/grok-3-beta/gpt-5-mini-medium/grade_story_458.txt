<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve tradition is clear and drives actions, but the pilot’s personality lacks depth beyond the spiritually secular trait; reactions to the coat button are symbolic but not revelatory of a nuanced inner life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing is uneven; the coffee stain reading feels forced as a plot device, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport baggage claim is vividly rendered with sensory details like oil and rain, enhancing the melancholic atmosphere; it supports the tone well, though timeframe integration feels slightly gimmicky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (coffee stains as constellations, coat button as relic) adds subtext, and the theme of unity through stories is compelling; however, emotional resonance is undercut by overwriting and a lack of raw, shown emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original concept of a flying library and coffee stain divination offers freshness, but metaphors like “fractal sorrow” verge on purple prose; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brevity seems deliberate; however, overly ornate style sometimes obscures clarity, and lingering impact is diminished by surface-level emotional engagement.</comment>
