<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a vendetta tied to erasure and loss, but the candy sculptor’s personality lacks distinct depth beyond scorn and creativity; actions align with motivation, yet voice feels muted without unique dialogue or internal perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the counterattack via sugar and photographs drives the story, though connections between events occasionally lack clarity, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the forgotten market enhances the mood of rebellion and loss, with vivid sensory details like caramel and seaweed; atmosphere supports motivation, though timeframe integration feels slightly underutilized in grounding the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through themes of memory and resistance, with strong imagery and symbolism in sugar maps; ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying on stated scorn rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of sugar cartography, but some metaphors (e.g., “lever on the world”) feel generic; emotional handling shows effort but lacks deeper nuance, and tone shifts slightly, risking predictability in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on erasure, though brevity sometimes feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
