<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "elegantly clumsy" attribute is well-integrated into actions and personality, but motivation feels slightly abstract; liberation through letting go is clear but lacks deeper personal stakes or specificity in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete despite the word limit; the action of dissecting silence is intriguing but doesn't fully drive a satisfying resolution, and pacing feels uneven with overemphasis on introspective moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the sand castle preservation lab is vividly described and enhances the ghostly atmosphere; sensory details like damp gypsum are evocative, though the timeframe of lunch breaks feels underexplored for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through the concept of silence and letting go, with strong imagery like sand slipping through fingers; however, the ending lacks a punch, and the central conflict remains too subtle for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining ghosts with sand castles and silence, avoiding clich√©s; metaphors are fresh, but some descriptions verge on overwrought, and emotional nuance occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style sometimes obscures clarity with dense introspection; it leaves a lingering thought about release, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
