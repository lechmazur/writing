<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters are sketched with some depth, particularly through the gambler’s duality and Mara’s trust, but motivations feel vague and reactions to the blueprint fragment lack specificity; their voices aren’t distinct enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is incomplete, with a beginning and middle but no clear resolution; pacing is uneven, feeling rushed at times within the word limit, and connections between actions and outcomes are murky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details like oil, old paper, and rain on the roof; the workshop setting enhances the mood, though its link to island memories feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story has moments of emotional impact and uses imagery well, but subtext is inconsistent; the ending lacks punch, and the central conflict is underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality with metaphors like “rumor” for the fragment, but leans on repetitive phrases (“hammered repose”) and lacks nuanced emotion, feeling somewhat formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than integral; style is evocative yet overelaborate, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
