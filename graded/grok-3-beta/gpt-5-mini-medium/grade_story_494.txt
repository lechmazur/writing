<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman’s personality is well-shaped by doubt and bravado, with a tender motive that adds depth, but his voice lacks distinctiveness, and reactions feel slightly overstated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven with overly dense introspection, and the action of "authorize" drives the story weakly, lacking clear cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and timeframe "between breaths" mesh evocatively, enhancing atmosphere with strong sensory details like mist and tapestry flutters, though the tone’s harsh tenderness occasionally overpowers the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism (tapestry as lost history) evoke thought, and the theme of fragile hope emerges, but the emotional impact is diluted by overwritten prose and a resolution that feels more poetic than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh but occasionally overextended; the style shows individuality yet borders on purple prose with dense language, and emotional nuance is present but sometimes explicitly stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style’s complexity hampers clarity at times; it leaves a lingering thought, though the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
