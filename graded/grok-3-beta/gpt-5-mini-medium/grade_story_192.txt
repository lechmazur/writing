<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Livia’s motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear, but her personality as an "eager lookout" feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance in her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between analyzing poltergeist activity and the wager of faith feels forced, disrupting coherence and pacing at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Roman villa setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere of ritual, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of ruthless kindness doesn’t fully mesh with the setting’s mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Livia’s wager, with decent use of symbolism (altar, sewing box), but the central conflict is vague, and the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of blending analog relics with digital disconnection is intriguing, the metaphors are occasionally generic, and the handling of emotion leans toward telling rather than showing, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
