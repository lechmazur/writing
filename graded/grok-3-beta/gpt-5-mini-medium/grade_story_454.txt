<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for acceptance is clear and drives actions, but the "rationally emotional" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks a strong causal tie to prior tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park setting is evocative with sensory details like tinny laughs and decayed tickets, enhancing mood, though connection to character motivation feels slightly superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., clover as defiance) add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is diminished by overt telling over showing; central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "skin-between-worlds" are fresh, but some prose borders on purple with over-elaboration; emotional handling shows nuance at times but occasionally states feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the vignette style, but style occasionally hinders clarity with dense phrasing; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
