<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The shipwrecked merchant’s motivation to shatter the illusion is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond "aloof passion" and "honestly strange," lacking depth in voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of ascending driving the narrative, though pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and some connections between action and illusion-shattering are forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The space station setting and post-apocalyptic timeframe are evocative and complement the tone of aloof passion; sensory details like peeling posters enhance immersion, though some atmospheric elements feel repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild reflection on truth versus illusion, with decent use of symbolism (butter churn as relic), but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery (circuitry behind holograms) is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable rebellion tropes without subversion, and phrases like "aloof passion" feel overused and formulaic, lacking true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often overcomplicates clarity with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought on illusion, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
