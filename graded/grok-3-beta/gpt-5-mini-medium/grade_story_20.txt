<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to chronicle social movements is clear, but the "disappointed archer" lacks depth or distinct voice; their actions feel more symbolic than personal, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a subtle arc within the word limit through the confrontation at the bridge, but pacing feels uneven with overwritten descriptions slowing momentum; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial imagery create a striking, surreal atmosphere that enhances the mood of regret and reflection; sensory details are evocative, though occasionally overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through thematic depth on memory and confrontation, with strong imagery, but emotional impact is muted by detached narration; dialogue is purposeful but sparse; subtext is present yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the surreal setting and concept show originality, metaphors like "slow dance of celestial bodies" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally veers into overwrought language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though impact is diluted by emotional distance.</comment>
