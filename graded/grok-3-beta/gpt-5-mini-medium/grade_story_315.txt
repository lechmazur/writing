<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to "laugh in the face of the inevitable dawn" is intriguing and consistent, but the spiritual con artist's depth feels underdeveloped; her voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue-heavy moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the action of "ejecting certainty" drives the story but lacks clear causal grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quantum entanglement lab setting is vividly described with sensory details like ozone and coffee, enhancing atmosphere; tone of serious playfulness complements the concept, though object integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through metaphors of entanglement and truth, with a satisfying ending; however, central conflict lacks sharpness, and emotional showing is occasionally overshadowed by overt telling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about truth's cost; style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
