<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and drives actions, but the aimless traveler's personality lacks depth beyond the trope of a wanderer; reactions to objects like the handkerchief are poignant yet underexplored for deeper personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with grilling as a central action driving preservation, but pacing feels uneven with dense imagery occasionally stalling momentum; coherence is maintained, though some causal links are more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is evocatively paired with sensory details like grilling aromas and tactile imagery, enhancing the mournful tone; however, the timeframe "hush as a snowflake melts" feels more decorative than integral to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through themes of loss and memory, with strong metaphors like grilling letters; yet, the conflict is subtle to a fault, lacking sharper tension, and the ending, while poignant, doesn't fully resolve the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery is often fresh, especially in blending cooking with language, but some metaphors (e.g., "lost comma") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like grilling in an archive, leaving a lingering sense of cultural preservation; however, overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
