<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand the past is clear and drives actions, but the jaded bartender's personality lacks depth beyond surface cynicism; the transition to scientist feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed conclusions; connections between doodles and fate are conceptually intriguing but lack logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting in a crystal growing lab is vividly described with sensory details like ozone and sugar, enhancing the strange tone, but the timeframe of fireworks feels underutilized and disconnected from the core narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity about fate and memory, with strong imagery like crystals as cities, but lacks emotional depth in character reactions and relies on telling over showing; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Concept of linking doodles to crystal patterns is original, but metaphors like fate as a script feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, and tone occasionally shifts unevenly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story shows creative integration of elements like the scalpel and lab, but cohesion suffers from underdeveloped character depth and uneven pacing; it leaves a lingering idea of negotiable fate, yet lacks polish for top-tier impact.</comment>
