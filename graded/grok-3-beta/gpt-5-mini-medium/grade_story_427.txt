<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to become a weaver of dreams is intriguing but underdeveloped; the mechanical arm and sock are quirky yet lack depth in revealing personal stakes or history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; deconstruction as action drives conflict but pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by ambitious elements; creative thinking in combining concepts is evident, but style occasionally obscures clarity and depth feels surface-level.</comment>
