<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The jumpy necromancer's anxiety shapes her actions, but her motivation to unmask the icon feels somewhat abstract and lacks deeper personal stakes. Reactions to the fishhook are intriguing but underdeveloped, and her voice isn't distinct enough to stand out amidst the dense setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of faltering and the method of paint analysis driving the story forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between footsteps and tension are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly bizarre, enhancing the tone of clear complexity and supporting the necromancer's odd quest. Sensory details like pixellated tiles and glitchy halos are evocative, though some elements (e.g., two suns) feel decorative rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on curated myths, with decent use of symbolism (fishhook as truth-compass). However, emotional impact is muted, conflict resolution feels abrupt, and subtext about forgiveness isn’t fully fleshed out. Showing versus telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining necromancy with pixelated forensics, avoiding overt clichés. Metaphors like "pixels bled into confession" are fresh, but emotional nuance is thin, and some descriptors (e.g., "typically bizarre") feel generic. Style is distinct but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is achieved despite numerous elements, and creative integration of paint analysis shows thoughtfulness. However, the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
