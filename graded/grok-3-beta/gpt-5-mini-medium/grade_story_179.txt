<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The confident watchman’s personality and motivation are clear, with his dual nature of confidence and forcibly gentle humility shaping his actions. However, his voice and deeper emotional nuance remain underdeveloped, limiting the depth of character exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of mobilizing bees driving the narrative. Yet, the pacing feels uneven, and some cause-effect links, like the resolution of envy, are more implied than shown, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The giant beehive interior is vividly described with sensory details like honeyed light and buzzing envy, enhancing the atmosphere. However, the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly forced, missing deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its metaphor of envy as a beetle and uses imagery effectively. Subtext around yearning and cooperation is present, but the emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the beehive setting and fingerprint metaphor show originality, some imagery (e.g., “sunlight through combs”) borders on cliché without subversion. Emotional handling leans toward stated rather than shown, and the tone occasionally shifts, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the beehive and yearning, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity. It leaves a lingering thought about envy and cooperation, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
