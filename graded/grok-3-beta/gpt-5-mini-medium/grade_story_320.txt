<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lale’s shyness is adequately portrayed but lacks depth in influencing her actions beyond surface reticence; her motivation to right a cosmic imbalance feels intriguing but underexplored, missing emotional nuance in her reactions to photographs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot’s structure is ambitious but falters in coherence due to abrupt shifts between timelines and social media elements, leaving the resolution feeling rushed and incomplete within the word limit; cause and effect are murky at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The underwater city market is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the mood of melancholy, but the connection between setting and action feels tenuous, and the atmosphere only partially supports the cosmic motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its imagery of regret, with some effective metaphors, but lacks a strong central conflict or satisfying ending; subtext is present but not deeply layered, and the style is occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors of sorrow and regret, with metaphors that occasionally feel forced; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a moderate level of cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overly complex phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, yet the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
