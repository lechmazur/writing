<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is inconsistent; the introverted empath's trait of being "obviously hidden" is intriguing but underexplored in action, lacking depth in motivation beyond vague kindness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Plot structure feels fragmented; the action of marshaling resources is present but lacks a clear causal arc within the tight word limit, leaving the resolution incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly described with sensory details like "oil, salt, and comet dust," effectively immersing the reader, though the tone occasionally clashes with the action's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is moderate; while imagery and symbolism (marionette, starfish) are evocative, the emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by overreliance on ornate language and generic metaphors like "slow tide," diluting a potentially unique perspective with somewhat predictable emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic, and the style leans overly complex, obscuring clarity.</comment>
