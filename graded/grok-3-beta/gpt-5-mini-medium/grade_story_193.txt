<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are intriguing, with the exiled prince's loneliness and motivation to cure it clear, but development feels surface-level; reactions to the mortar and pestle are symbolic yet lack deeper personal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the snowstorm driving the encounter, but pacing feels uneven; the resolution is poetic yet lacks a strong causal link to prior events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid, with the abandoned customs office and snowstorm enhancing the mood of exile; sensory details like thyme and old coin are evocative, though settingâ€™s connection to action feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
