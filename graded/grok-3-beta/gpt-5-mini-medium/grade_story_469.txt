<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map tunnels is clear, but the "logically emotional" trait feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance beyond calculated decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but rushed within the word limit; overreach as action drives tension, yet cause-effect links feel vague at critical turns like the heirloom choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Whispering gallery setting and garden scent create immersive atmosphere with strong sensory detail, though connection to timeframe "final countdown" remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (key, tunnels) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by over-explained reasoning; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors (garden scent, ribcage tunnel) are fresh, but overall style verges on purple prose with overly ornate language; emotional portrayal leans on stated logic over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style often hinders clarity with dense phrasing; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
