<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The agoraphobic trait shapes the mayor's isolation and actions effectively, with clear motivation to avoid external crossings, but the internal conflict lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice beyond descriptive prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible within the word limit, with a logical connection between the snuffbox and resolution, but pacing feels uneven, and the action of the "crack" doesn't drive momentum as powerfully as it could.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering dunes and rain create a vivid atmosphere that complements the tone of resignation, with strong sensory details like "paperthroats," though the settingâ€™s integration with the object feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the theme of inherited burdens, with effective imagery, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
