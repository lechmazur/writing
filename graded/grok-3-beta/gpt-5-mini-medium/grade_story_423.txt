<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The earnest knight's sincerity is evident, but his personality lacks depth beyond the attribute of earnestness; motivation to spark flames is clear yet underdeveloped in personal stakes or backstory, leaving actions somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of triggering a flame driving the story, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained but lacks a stronger causal build-up to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arid desert and ruined aqueduct setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the nostalgic tone and supporting the concept of reviving warmth; minor disconnect between greenhouse and desert feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (map as living fresco, greenhouse as memory) evoke thought and emotion; ending is purposeful, but central conflict feels understated; subtext is present but not fully layered for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While metaphors like "sequins on a mourning gown" are fresh, some phrases verge on purple prose, and emotional resonance relies more on description than nuanced showing; originality is present but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, but a lingering sense of thaw and rebellion adds depth beyond the surface.</comment>
