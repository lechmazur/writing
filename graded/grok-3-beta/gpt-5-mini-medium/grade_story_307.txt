<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "quietly rebellious" nature is evident in actions, but motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory; lacks a distinct voice despite poetic framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; the action of shaping rebellion is poetic but lacks clear progression or resolution within the tight word limit, leading to a rushed sense of impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting and timeframe are vividly described with sensory details like ozone and confetti, enhancing atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and metaphor (e.g., fairy lights as promises), but emotional impact is diluted by overwriting; conflict is present but resolution lacks punch; theme of light as hope is clear yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but metaphors (e.g., DVD as scripture) feel overwrought and occasionally generic; tone shifts slightly with ornate language, risking purple prose and reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesive in thematic intent, but style leans too heavily on dense lyricism, hindering clarity; brief length feels deliberate but not fully impactful; lingering thought is present yet not deeply resonant.</comment>
