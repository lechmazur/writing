<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with transformation driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven, with dense imagery occasionally stalling momentum, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is evocatively described with sensory details like "grease and ghostlight," enhancing the eerie atmosphere and supporting the theme of transformation, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery creates subtext around transformation and rebellion, and the ending offers a subtle shift in the keeper's perspective, but emotional resonance is limited by the pickpocket's underdeveloped inner world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements like poetry and ventriloquism, some metaphors feel overwrought or generic, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate prose, detracting from authenticity and risking formulaic impressions.</comment>
