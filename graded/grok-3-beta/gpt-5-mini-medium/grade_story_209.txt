<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cal's motivation to map abandoned railways is clear and ties to his past, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "artfully messy" attribute; his actions with the hairbrush feel symbolic but underexplored in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by mapping and honesty, but pacing feels uneven with abrupt shifts between action and reflection, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is evocative and enhances the mood of loss and discovery; sensory details like echoes and radios humming are strong, though the hospital beep timeframe feels disconnected at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic resonance with solid imagery and symbolism (hairbrush as memory), but the ending lacks punch; subtext around honesty is present but not fully layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers an unusual premise, some metaphors (e.g., "brittle coins") feel generic; emotional handling shows nuance in places but often states rather than shows feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
