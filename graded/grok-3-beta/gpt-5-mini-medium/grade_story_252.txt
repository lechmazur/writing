<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; the action of recalibrating the crack lacks clear causality, and pacing is uneven within the word limit, rushing key moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on overly ornate prose and generic emotional descriptors, reducing originality; tone shifts slightly disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style often obscures clarity; length feels constraining rather than deliberate, and lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
