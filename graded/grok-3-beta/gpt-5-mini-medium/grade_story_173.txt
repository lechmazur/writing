<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map trade routes is clear, but the "trustworthy unique" attribute feels superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into actions or personality; lacks distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the dried leaves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reclaiming driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven with overly dense exposition; coherence is strained by abrupt shifts between abstract concepts and concrete actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Underwater city hall setting is evocative and enhances the bittersweet tone with strong sensory imagery (salt, marble, anemones), but its connection to the orchardist’s motivation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story has subtext about loss and rebuilding, with some effective imagery (grieving tree), but emotional impact is diluted by overwriting; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a sharp punch; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution leans on overly ornate language (purple prose) and generic metaphors (e.g., “tides of time”); emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like dried leaves and trade routes, but style often hinders clarity with excessive abstraction; leaves a lingering thought of loss, though impact is muted by overwrought prose.</comment>
