<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's joyless nature and internal conflict are evident, but motivations feel somewhat vague and reactions to the drawer knob lack deeper psychological insight, resulting in a partially formed persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels fragmented; organizing as an action drives the narrative minimally, and pacing is uneven within the word limit, with abrupt shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor (drawer knob as anchor), but writing leans on ornate language and generic emotional descriptors, lacking nuanced human depth and showing signs of formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style often overshadows clarity with excessive flourish; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with lingering impact muted.</comment>
