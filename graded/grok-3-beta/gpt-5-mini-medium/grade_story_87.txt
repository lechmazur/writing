<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a compelling backstory of betrayal, but the "hyperactively serene" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between mixtapes and plot progression is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steampunk dining hall is vividly rendered with sensory details like steam and brass gears, enhancing atmosphere, though the timeframe "hush of a memory reclaimed" feels abstract and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., "caramelized memory") creates emotional resonance, but the ending feels slightly hollow, lacking a fully satisfying resolution to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining steampunk with personal vendetta, but metaphors like "savage grace" feel overused, and emotional depth occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
