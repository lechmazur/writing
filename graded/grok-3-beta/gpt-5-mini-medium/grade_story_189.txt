<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's literal attribute shapes actions well, particularly in decoding maps as circuits, but motivation feels slightly abstract and lacks deeper emotional grounding; reactions to the phone booth key are intriguing but underdeveloped in personal significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through overcharging the beacon, with a clear arc despite word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like spectral tides) are abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse basement and post-water-war timeframe create a compelling, eerie atmosphere; sensory details like damp stones and humming metal enhance mood, though some setting elements feel underutilized in relation to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity with star maps and treaties, and imagery like phosphorescent maps is striking; yet emotional resonance is limited by detached narration, and ending, while purposeful, lacks deeper impact or subtext beyond surface resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining star maps and lighthouse tech, with fresh metaphors like "old glass purred like a planet"; however, some descriptions are overly ornate, and character reasoning feels mechanical at times, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the phone booth key and star maps; style supports clarity, but brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and lingering impact is moderate due to limited emotional depth.</comment>
