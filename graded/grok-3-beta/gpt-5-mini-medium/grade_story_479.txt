<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear and consistent, but the glamorous undertaker's personality feels more performative than deeply explored; lacks nuanced voice or internal conflict beyond surface ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the act of elongating memories drives the story, yet connections between actions and outcomes are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the social network archive is intriguing and supports the concept well, with sensory details like citrus paint enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of paint mixing feels underutilized as a narrative anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through the theme of transforming the ordinary into sacred, with strong imagery like "satin over steel"; yet, emotional resonance is somewhat diluted by repetitive focus on ritual over deeper conflict or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique premise and metaphors like the brass tape as an "ancestral tongue"; however, some phrases feel overly ornate, bordering on purple prose, and emotional depth lacks subtle subtext, leaning on explicit description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering idea about ordinariness; yet, style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaboration, and the brevity sometimes feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
