<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but their personality as "aggressively kind" feels inconsistently portrayed, with actions like flinging a whistle lacking depth in emotional nuance or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the dancer’s step, whale call, and whistle feels contrived; pacing is uneven with overly dense imagery slowing the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is evocatively described with sensory details like salt and fog, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the link between setting and the dancer’s timeframe feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (whistle as talisman, whale song as ledger) add depth, but the emotional impact is muted by overwriting; the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and conflict remains vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on overly ornate language and predictable motifs of sea and memory; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the whale call, but the dense style hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering mood, though not a particularly profound or unique impression.</comment>
