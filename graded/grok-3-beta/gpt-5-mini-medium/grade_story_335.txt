<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to make peace with the past is present but underdeveloped; the "shaky mercenary" trait feels more descriptive than integral to actions or voice, lacking depth in reaction to the amber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of "finalizing" is vague and lacks clear cause-effect progression, with pacing rushed at the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting of the collapsed cathedral turned artist haven is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but connection to timeframe "echoing hour" feels forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through confessions, with decent imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable uniqueness; ending feels more convenient than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with poetic flourishes, but some metaphors (e.g., "fired memory") feel overused; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves mild cohesion with elements, but style leans overly ornate, obscuring clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with only faint lingering impact.</comment>
