<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The reckless hunter's personality is intriguing with the "meticulously careless" attribute shaping a complex duality, but his motivation to map ghost towns feels slightly underdeveloped in emotional depth, lacking a visceral personal stake beyond the promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the resurfacing promise driving action, but pacing feels uneven—some transitions are rushed, and cause-effect links between the hunter’s choices and outcomes are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned funfair in a misty forest is vividly rendered with sensory details like damp wood and ghostly Ferris wheel imagery, strongly supporting the atmosphere; however, the setting’s connection to the hunter’s motivation could be more explicitly tied to emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic reflection through imagery and the promise’s weight, with strong use of metaphor (maps as wounds), but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and dialogue with musicians, while purposeful, feels slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique lens on mapping as memory preservation, some metaphors (e.g., “atomize memories”) feel overused or strained, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the funfair and vintage lens, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but stylistic flourishes sometimes obscure clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
