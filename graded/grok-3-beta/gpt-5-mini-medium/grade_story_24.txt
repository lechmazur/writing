<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to stir cold hearts is clear and aligns with the bard's subversive puppetry, but the "ordinarily extraordinary" trait feels underexplored in action and voice, lacking depth in personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from puppet shows to sending the apologetic text is present but feels unevenly paced; the connection between sowing warmth and the text's lull is logical but lacks tighter cause-effect integration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore setting is vividly realized with sensory details and enhances the fractured idyll tone, though the seedy bar atmosphere occasionally overshadows the broader labyrinthine mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional resonance through puppet confessions and warmth imagery, with satisfying subtext in the apology, but overreliance on metaphor risks overshadowing direct conflict and character nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the puppet show method and dentures symbolism, but some imagery (e.g., "ember held between teeth") feels slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration and a lingering warmth, but style sometimes leans overly ornate, hindering clarity; brief length feels deliberate yet slightly limits depth of resolution.</comment>
