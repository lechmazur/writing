<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's overworked nature and confident uncertainty are well-portrayed through first-person voice, but motivation to outdance inevitability feels abstract and underdeveloped within actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete despite word limit; rummaging drives action minimally, and connection between start and end is vague, lacking clear resolution or progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of Vanishing Point Gallery enhances mood with evocative sensory details like old varnish, effectively supporting tone and concept, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on purple prose, and emotional depth occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style sometimes obscures clarity; brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a fully lingering impact.</comment>
