<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's analytical innovation shapes actions, but motivation feels surface-level; nondescript nature lacks depth or distinct voice, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with decryption driving action, but pacing feels uneven within word limit; arc is present but resolution lacks full impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; length feels managed, yet depth is somewhat superficial.</comment>
