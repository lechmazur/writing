<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear—duty and a quiet justice drive the scholar—but the "uncommonly typical" attribute feels underutilized, lacking depth in shaping personality beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of contamination driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the method's logic (echo in a well) is intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting for time travelers is evocative and enhances the atmosphere of temporal tension; sensory details like humming currents and small light are effective, though more variety in senses could deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes quiet reflection on truth and memory with strong imagery (coil as throat), but the ending feels more contemplative than impactful; subtext is present but not fully resonant within the tight scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in concept with the coil as a storytelling device, but metaphors like "unspoken heart" border on cliché without fresh subversion; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the coil and setting, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
