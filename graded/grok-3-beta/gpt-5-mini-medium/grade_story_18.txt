<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathy shapes a unique perspective, and the motivation to find truth is clear, but the emotional depth of "tragically joyful" feels underexplored, limiting character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the statue's quest for truth, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolution and some unclear cause-effect links in the final reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like mechanical sighs and steam, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness, though the setting’s connection to telepathy feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (e.g., "light of recognition") add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing the statue’s sorrow; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is original, some metaphors like "rainwater behind eyelids" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like telepathy and truth-seeking, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
