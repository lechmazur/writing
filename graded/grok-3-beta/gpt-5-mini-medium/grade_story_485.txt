<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the raider's blend of recklessness and devotion, but the "impulsively thoughtful" trait feels inconsistently applied, and the voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional beats and the warning action lacks a strong causal impact on resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The underwater lab setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of secrecy, though sensory details are sparse and the tone of fractured grace occasionally clashes with the urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of loyalty and betrayal, with decent use of symbolism (charcoal sigil), but dialogue feels stilted and the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While some imagery (charcoal as amulet) is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of forgotten genius and social collapse without subversion, and emotional depth is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves a tenuous cohesion with assigned elements, but style verges on overwrought, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
