<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the nomad’s transformation, but pacing feels rushed, and connections between elements like masquerade and arrogance are underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is attempted with thematic elements, but the story feels forced around assigned components, lacking a fully polished, lingering resonance.</comment>
