<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edmund’s submissive aristocrat persona is intriguing, with a clear motivation to protect the nightjar, but his personality feels inconsistently developed, lacking depth in emotional conflict beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven, with overemphasis on descriptive tangents that dilute the central action of protecting the bird.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret agent workshop setting is vividly described with sensory details like solder and motor oil, enhancing the atmosphere, though the yard work timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected at times.</comment>
