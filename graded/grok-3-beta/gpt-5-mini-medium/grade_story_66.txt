<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to find belonging is clear but underdeveloped; the "quiet deserter" trait feels more descriptive than defining, lacking depth in how it shapes actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while thematic elements like breaking cycles are present, the narrative feels more vignette than story, with pacing that meanders.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with plant communication and sensory details like ash and chlorophyll, but the settingâ€™s integration with action feels inconsistent, underutilizing its potential to ground the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirrors, masks) and subtext about belonging, but emotional impact is muted by abstract delivery; lacks a sharp conflict or satisfying closure despite thoughtful themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining plant communication with personal exile, but metaphors (e.g., "taxonomy of belonging") border on overwrought; emotional nuance exists but often feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in blending elements, but cohesion suffers from abstract focus over narrative drive; lingering thought is present but not powerful enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
