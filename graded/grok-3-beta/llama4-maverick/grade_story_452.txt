<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "softhearted" trait feels superficial and underexplored in actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and lacks clear cause-effect connections; the method of stabilizing fate via midnight visits feels arbitrary within the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are evocative with the cyberpunk city and planetarium, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of muted euphoria feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; imagery and symbolism (e.g., belt buckle) are present but feel forced and fail to evoke a strong response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on generic descriptors and predictable patterns; metaphors are overused and lack originality, diminishing authenticity and individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but often awkwardly, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
