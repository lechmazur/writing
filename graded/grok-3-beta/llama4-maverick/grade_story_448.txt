<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to build a legacy is clear, but the "rebelliously docile" trait feels underdeveloped and contradictory without deeper exploration; Elian's actions lack a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the candlestick beyond generic curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed and incomplete within the word limit; the action of jettisoning doubts is underdeveloped, and pacing suffers from abrupt shifts to broad guild transformation without clear cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the chimney sweep guild hall is evocative with sensory details like soot and oil, but its connection to the candlestick and mage feels tenuous; atmosphere supports nostalgia but lacks depth in enhancing the core action or motivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and predictable progression; lacks originality in handling "unknown histories" and relies on clich√©d themes of innovation without fresh perspective or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; lacks lingering depth or creative spark in combining elements.</comment>
