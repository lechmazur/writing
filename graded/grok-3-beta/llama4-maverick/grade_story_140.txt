<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation as a tortured protector is hinted at but lacks depth; their emotional unleashing feels vague and their connection to the doll is symbolic yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc from isolation to transformation, but pacing feels rushed, and the planetarium encounter lacks sufficient grounding to drive the resolution convincingly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in imagery, but relies on overused metaphors like "stars twinkling like diamonds" and lacks nuanced emotional depth, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style often prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
