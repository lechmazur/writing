<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation as a heartbroken reaper seeking solace is clear, but the emotional depth and distinct voice are underdeveloped; reactions to the novel feel generic rather than uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc from sorrow to purpose, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between mapping springs and emotional healing lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cave library setting and dripping water create a melancholic atmosphere that supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse; setting-concept connection is surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance through heartbreak and healing, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery is present but lacks originality, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some individual style, but metaphors like "morning fog" are clich√©d; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative follows a predictable healing journey template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks depth, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
