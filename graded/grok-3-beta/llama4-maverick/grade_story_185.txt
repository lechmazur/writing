<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "peculiar collector" feels more like a vehicle for the plot than a fully realized individual with a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect relationships are vague, especially regarding how decoding keys shifts probability maps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the probability mapping center is intriguing but underdeveloped; atmosphere is evocative at times but lacks consistent sensory detail to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolism (pencil stub as power), but emotional resonance is shallow, relying on telling over showing, and the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable patterns; metaphors like "long-dormant flame" are clich√©d, and emotional handling lacks nuance, feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style often obscures clarity with ornate language.</comment>
