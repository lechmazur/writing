<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the aloofness of the cartographer is stated but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, and motivation feels abstract rather than grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the meeting and conversation feel static, with no significant progression or conflict driving the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The futuristic shopping mall is described with some visual detail, but sensory immersion is limited, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional stakes or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of evocative imagery (e.g., cracked tile as symbol), but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by generic metaphors (e.g., "waves against the shore") and a predictable emotional arc; lacks a unique voice or surprising twist, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the story lacks depth or a lingering impact despite some creative imagery.</comment>
