<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "dazed noble" feels more like a vehicle for the plot than a fully realized individual with nuanced reactions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels repetitive and lacks tension; the action of chalking messages drives the story, yet pacing is uneven with little escalation or resolution beyond surface-level impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sound garden setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere, with sensory details like rustling leaves, but its connection to the nobleâ€™s rebellion feels underdeveloped and somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through rebellion and creativity but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying conflict resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept but leans on generic descriptors and predictable rebellion tropes without subversion; lacks nuanced emotion and feels formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion but lacks depth and lasting impact; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
