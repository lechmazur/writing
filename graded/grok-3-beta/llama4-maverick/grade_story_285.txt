<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete with an unclear resolution; the action of emerging is present but lacks a concrete conflict or turning point, making the progression feel vague and rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is evocatively described and supports the atmosphere of tension, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the character's motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; while imagery like hermit crabs and ice/fire is present, it feels forced and fails to evoke a strong response or memorable impact; conflict is too abstract.</comment>
