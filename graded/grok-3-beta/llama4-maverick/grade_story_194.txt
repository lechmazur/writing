<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn healing traditions feels vague and underdeveloped; the lumberjack's spirited nature is mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the action of revamping life is more conceptual than concrete, leading to a disjointed progression with weak cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is intriguing and ties to the theme of transformation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through metaphor of transformation, but emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing; lacks a strong central conflict or tension within the brief narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable transformation tropes without subversion; metaphors like "darkest corners of psyche" feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than evoked through nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite assigned elements; brevity seems a limitation rather than a choice, and while creative in concept, it lacks depth or a lingering impact.</comment>
