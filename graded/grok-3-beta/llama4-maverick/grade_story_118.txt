<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the hive-mind therapist's peculiarity feels superficial and lacks depth in motivation or distinct voice, with reactions to objects like the charger plug being more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there is a beginning and end, the middle feels rushed, and the action of "draining" emotional blockages lacks clear cause-effect progression within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are intriguing with the secret agent facility, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and objects like the charger plug feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some symbolism with the wax and hindsight, emotional resonance is weak, and the narrative relies on telling rather than showing, with an unsatisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic metaphors and predictable patterns; the hive-mind concept feels underexplored, and emotional descriptions lack nuance, suggesting formulaic writing over unique insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than naturally integrated, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and depth in such a short piece.</comment>
