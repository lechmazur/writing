<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to shatter illusions is present but underdeveloped; the merchant's personality lacks depth and distinct voice, feeling more like a vessel for abstract ideas than a nuanced individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels forced and overly abstract; pacing is uneven with rushed metaphysical leaps that disrupt coherence and logical flow within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Space station setting is evocative and ties to the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the merchant's motivation, lacking immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; ending feels unsatisfying and lacks a clear, resonant conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on generic metaphors (stars as serpents) and predictable existential tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, lacking nuanced human depth or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
