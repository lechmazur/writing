<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits is present but lacks depth; the nostalgic tailor feels more like a vessel for the concept than a fully realized individual with a distinct voice or nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels repetitive and lacks a strong resolution; pacing is uneven with overemphasis on confessions, leaving little room for meaningful progression or cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Steampunk setting and stormy atmosphere are evocative with sensory details like coal smoke and ozone, but the connection between setting and character motivation feels superficial and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with the mirror and parallel lives but falls short of emotional resonance; writing relies heavily on telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying or purposeful impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive phrases like "storm raged on" and generic descriptors; lacks originality in handling tropes of mirrors and transcendence, showing little unique style or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
