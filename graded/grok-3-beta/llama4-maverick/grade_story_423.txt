<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to "spark flames in a land of ice" feels vague and disconnected from actions; the knight's earnestness is stated but not deeply shown through nuanced behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or conflict within the word limit; mapping the roof feels arbitrary and doesn't drive a compelling progression or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ruined aqueduct and desert is evocative with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the knight's motivation or the story's deeper themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional depth or subtext; heavy reliance on telling over showing, with metaphors like "canvas of life" feeling forced and lacking impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on overused imagery and purple prose ("diamonds scattered across velvet"); lacks originality and shows formulaic patterns with generic emotional descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite assigned elements; lacks cohesion and depth, with style often obscuring clarity rather than enhancing the narrative.</comment>
