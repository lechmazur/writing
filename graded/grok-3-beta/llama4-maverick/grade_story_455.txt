<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to out-face past judgments is present but lacks depth; the "intensely relaxed" attribute feels contradictory and underexplored in shaping personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels forced; the action of corroborating via shadow patterns lacks logical grounding, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on generic descriptors and predictable patterns; metaphors like "weight of scars" are overused, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks clarity or lasting impact despite some creative intent.</comment>
