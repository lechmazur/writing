<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue truth is clear, but the apprehensive archer's personality lacks depth; her exceptional marksmanship is mentioned but not meaningfully integrated into actions or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the act of uttering truth as a resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center setting is evocative with neon lights and machinery, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with themes of truth and hope, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery like "borrowed dawn" is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality with the cyberpunk-archer juxtaposition, but metaphors like "skeletal hand" feel generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks depth or lasting impact beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
