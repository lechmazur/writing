<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Max's portrayal as a bluffing swindler is surface-level; his motivation to reveal a truth feels inconsistent with his deceptive nature, and his "energetically lethargic" attribute lacks clear impact on actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end feels forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of a reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is evocative and complements the tone, but sensory details are generic, and the atmosphere only partially supports Max's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with the blank price tag and invisible allies, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; the ending feels contrived rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable tropes of redemption and connection without subversion; metaphors are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and it lacks a lingering depth or memorable impact.</comment>
