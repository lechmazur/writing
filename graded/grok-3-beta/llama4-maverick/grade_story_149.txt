<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to unify scattered minds is clear, but the "unlikely prophet" lacks depth or distinct voice; their rebellious nature feels stated rather than shown through specific actions or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is vague with no clear resolution; the action of estranging is conceptually present but lacks concrete development, and pacing feels rushed with abrupt shifts between introspection and external elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The giant's study setting is evocative with candlelight and shadows, creating a haunting atmosphere, but sensory details are generic, and the connection between setting and wilted paper flower feels superficial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and while thereâ€™s a lingering mood, it lacks depth or a compelling takeaway for the reader.</comment>
