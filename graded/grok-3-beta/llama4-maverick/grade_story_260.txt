<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's obsession is clear, but lacks depth or nuance; motivation to gather lost souls feels abstract and underexplored, failing to fully connect with the crossword creator identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between rewriting diaries and reconciliation is vague, lacking clear cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere at the whisper collection point is evocative with sensory hints like moonlight, but the setting's connection to the brass key ring and character motivation feels tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with reconciliation theme, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking enough to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on overused metaphors (moth to flame) and lacks fresh sensory detail; tone shifts slightly, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
