<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's stage fright feels tacked on and doesn't meaningfully shape her actions or exorcism process. Motivation tied to family lies is vague and lacks specificity to drive her personality or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the exorcism action drives the story but feels repetitive and lacks a strong arc within the word limit. Cause and effect are muddled, with pacing rushed at the climax without sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is intriguing and somewhat enhances the eerie tone, but sensory details are sparse and generic, failing to fully immerse the reader or connect deeply with the action or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or memorable impact; imagery and symbolism (e.g., wildflowers) are present but feel forced and lack subtext. The ending is unsatisfying, with tension unresolved and themes underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clich√©d phrases and predictable structure; metaphors like "defiant hush" are overused and lack freshness. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic writing over nuanced insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. The style lacks clarity and depth, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
