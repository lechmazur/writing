<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue ancient traditions is stated but lacks depth or personal stakes; the first-person voice feels generic and fails to reveal unique traits or emotional nuance through reactions to the whistle or whale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the action of flinging the whistle feels arbitrary, and connections between elements like the dancer and whale are asserted rather than organically developed, leaving the arc incomplete within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is evocative and supports the tone of mystery, with sensory details like the whale’s call enhancing atmosphere, but the connection to the dancer’s timeframe feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or subtext; symbolism of the whistle and whale is intriguing but underdeveloped, and the ending feels more declarative than impactful, with no clear conflict or tension driving the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic phrasing and stated emotions (“I felt a jolt of brazen calm”) rather than shown nuance; metaphors are predictable, and the narrative lacks a distinct style or surprising perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite creative elements; the story feels forced around assigned components rather than using them in service of a unified narrative, and the brevity exposes a lack of depth or lingering impact.</comment>
