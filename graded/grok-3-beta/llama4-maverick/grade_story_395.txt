<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks tension; the alliance forms too easily, and the resolution feels predictable within the word limit, missing a compelling arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or subtext; the narrative tells rather than shows, and the ending feels formulaic without a lingering impact or nuanced theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by predictable tropes of unlikely alliances; writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and lacks a distinct authorial voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but not in a way that elevates the narrative or leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
