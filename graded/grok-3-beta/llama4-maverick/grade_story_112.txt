<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation shifts abruptly from aimless wandering to a purposeful quest without sufficient internal conflict or development; the "factually imaginative" trait feels superficially applied rather than deeply integrated into personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a strong central conflict; the transition from discovering the handkerchief to preserving recipes feels forced and lacks logical progression, undermining coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like the scent of parchment and melting snowflake, but the writing system archive setting is underutilized in enhancing the action or deepening the story's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and subtext; while imagery like the snowflake is poetic, the narrative overly tells rather than shows emotions, and the ending feels more sentimental than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing relies on flowery, repetitive phrases like "seeds of vigilance" without fresh metaphors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced, suggesting formulaic construction over unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style often prioritizes ornate language over clarity or lasting impact.</comment>
