<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between actions and grandmother's secrets are vague, and pacing stumbles with abrupt shifts to mystical elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but the timeframe "after the last human dream" is underutilized and feels disconnected from the mood and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in setting but leans on generic descriptors and predictable mystical tropes; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than evoked through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but struggles with depth; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of layered meaning or lingering impact.</comment>
