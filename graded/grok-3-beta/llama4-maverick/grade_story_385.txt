<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character Elian's "pleasant meddler" and "openly manipulative" traits are stated but not deeply explored; motivation to decode symbols feels vague and lacks personal stakes or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc; the action of weakening conventional thinking is abstract and poorly connected to the method of footprints, resulting in a disjointed narrative despite the short length.</comment>
