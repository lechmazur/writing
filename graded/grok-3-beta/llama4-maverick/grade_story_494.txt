<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arrogance and doubtful confidence are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to revive a dying art feels vague and lacks depth in personal stakes. His actions align with the mission, but his personality’s impact on the method (singing) feels superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the song driving a clear transformation in the calligraphy master. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end, while present, lacks a stronger causal thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is vividly described with sensory details like the scent of ink, enhancing the mood of forgotten dreams. The atmosphere supports the concept of shackled potential well, though the timeframe "between breaths" feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the revival theme, with decent use of symbolism (tapestry fragment). However, the ending feels predictable, and the lack of dialogue limits character depth. Subtext is present but not richly layered; it shows more than tells, but not consistently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like "river breaking free from shackles" feel overused. Emotional resonance is stated more than shown at times, and the tone shifts slightly unnaturally toward the end. Originality is moderate but lacks a truly unique perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with the assigned elements, though some (like "authorize") are awkwardly integrated. The style is clear but not striking, and the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate. It leaves a lingering thought, but not a profound one.</comment>
