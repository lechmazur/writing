<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to make peace with the past is present but lacks depth or specificity; the "shaky" and "carefully reckless" traits are mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or internal conflict, resulting in a shallow portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between beginning and end feels vague; the action of finalizing a quest via rumor chains is intriguing but underdeveloped, leading to a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the collapsed cathedral turned street artist’s haven is evocative and complements the tone of longing; sensory details like damp stone and spray paint are effective, though inconsistently applied, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with the theme of closure, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the amber is promising but feels forced, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in setting and concept, but leans on generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats; metaphors like the glowing amber feel clichéd, and the tone shifts unevenly, lacking a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
