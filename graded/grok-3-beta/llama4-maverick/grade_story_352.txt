<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve musical traditions is clear, but the "feral sky nomad" trait lacks depth in shaping personality or actions beyond a vague sense of wandering; first-person voice is present but not distinct or compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and end, but the action of conserving feels loosely connected to sculpting paths, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution; coherence is strained by abstract transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the invisible ink factory is evocative with sensory details like damp parchment, enhancing atmosphere, but the timeframe "between vanishing stars" feels underutilized and disconnected from the action.</comment>
