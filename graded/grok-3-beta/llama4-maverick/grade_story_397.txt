<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elian's jaded nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or distinct voice, and his motivation to understand the past feels vague and unrooted in specific personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the connection between doodles and globalizing a network feels forced and underdeveloped, disrupting coherence and pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory setting is intriguing and ties to the atmosphere of precision, but sensory details are minimal, and the connection to the bloodstained scalpel feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or subtext; the ending feels unresolved rather than purposeful, and thereâ€™s little showing over telling, with tension remaining surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic phrasing and predictable patterns; the doodle concept is somewhat fresh but executed without nuance or surprising twists, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
