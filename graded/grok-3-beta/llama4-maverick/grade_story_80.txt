<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's "ingeniously clueless" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to solve the riddle feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed at the resolution; connections between actions and the last fragment are logical but lack depth or surprise within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable mystery tropes without subversion; metaphors like "whisper secrets of the past" are generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt through nuanced detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion but lacks a lingering impact or creative spark; style is clear but uninspired, and brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
