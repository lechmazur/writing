<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Jack's transformation from pickpocket to poet feels underdeveloped; his motivation to challenge the status quo is stated but lacks depth or backstory to make it convincing. His voice is indistinct, and reactions to the dummy are more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from theft to transformation is present but feels forced and lacks logical progression; the poetry session as a method of change is intriguing but rushed within the word limit, disrupting pacing and coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly described with sensory details like hissing pipes, enhancing the eerie tone. However, the connection between setting and dummy feels superficial, and the atmosphere only partially supports Jack’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact through transformation but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; literary devices like the vortex imagery are present but overdone. The ending lacks a satisfying resolution, and the theme feels repetitive rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on clichés of haunted settings and sudden personal change without subversion; metaphors like "glassy stare" are generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than evoked, suggesting formulaic writing over unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the story incorporates many assigned elements, they often feel forced rather than cohesive; the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
