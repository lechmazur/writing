<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the aloof orphan's personality lacks depth beyond the surface trait of detachment, and their motivation to transform fear into courage feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while the garage cleaning provides a loose arc, the gravitational anomaly and device feel like disconnected tangents, disrupting coherence and pacing within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are underdeveloped; the gravitational anomaly is intriguing but lacks sensory detail or meaningful integration with the garage cleaning, leaving the mood inconsistent and unimmersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while the stones as symbols of resilience show potential, the emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality is lacking; the narrative relies on familiar tropes of personal transformation without fresh perspective, and the language occasionally feels formulaic, with generic descriptors instead of vivid, unique imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; the assigned elements feel forced together rather than organically integrated, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth rather than showcasing deliberate restraint.</comment>
