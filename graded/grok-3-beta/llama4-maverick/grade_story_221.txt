<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer feels underdeveloped; motivation to confront darkness is stated but lacks depth or specificity in actions, resulting in a generic voice despite first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the action of arousing memories drives the story, but pacing is uneven, and the resolution feels rushed within the word limit, lacking clear cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned carnival gallery is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection to the timeframe and object feels tenuous, slightly undermining immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery and symbolism (amber, thawing heart), but lacks deeper subtext or a satisfying conflict resolution; writing style is evocative yet overly ornate at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes of haunted pasts and abandoned places without subversion; metaphors like "thawing heart" feel overused, and emotional expression is more stated than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
