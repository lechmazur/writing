<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "gentle conjurer" attribute feels superficial and does not distinctly shape actions or personality beyond vague kindness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the garden's revival, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, lacking strong cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly described with sensory details like fungal luminescence and damp earth, but the tone of "joyful terror" feels inconsistently applied and disconnected from the setting's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the garden's rebirth, but lacks subtext or deeper conflict; symbolism of the butterfly is heavy-handed and not fully integrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality with the stained glass butterfly, but relies on predictable fantasy tropes and generic descriptors, lacking nuanced emotion or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative awkwardly rather than serving it; lacks lingering depth or a truly deliberate short-form impact.</comment>
