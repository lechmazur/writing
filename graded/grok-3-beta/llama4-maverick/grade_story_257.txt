<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ember's intellectually dreamy attribute is present but underdeveloped; her motivation to restore lost faith feels somewhat vague and lacks depth in execution, though her actions with the postcards and chalkboard align with her traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; while the action of reinventing drives the story, the progression feels more reflective than structured, with pacing that meanders rather than builds tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The autumn setting and fireflies create a evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse; the tone of bruised exhilaration complements the concept, though the setting's connection to the action feels incidental at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Ember's wonder, but lacks sharp conflict or tension; imagery of fireflies and postcards is symbolic yet not fully layered, leaving the impact somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on predictable themes of reinvention without fresh subversion; metaphors like fireflies as stars feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
