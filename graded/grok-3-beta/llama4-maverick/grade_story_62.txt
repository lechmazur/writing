<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of storytelling drives the narrative but feels repetitive and fails to build to a meaningful climax or change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard amphitheater setting is evocative with sensory details like fruit scent and rustling leaves, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the sewer origin and character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism of the cup and mundane explorations, but emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing; ending lacks punch or lasting resonance.</comment>
