<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for liberation is clear, but the personality of the elevator repair technician lacks depth or distinct voice beyond seeing ghosts; reactions to the flower crown feel symbolic but not personal enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; staking out ghost tours as a method is logical but underdeveloped, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is an intriguing setting that supports the theme of transience, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere lacks vivid immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through themes of letting go, and the flower crown symbolism is effective, but the conflict is understated, and the writing often tells rather than shows emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is somewhat original, the narrative relies on predictable ghost story tropes without subversion; metaphors like the flower crown are fresh but emotions are stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
