<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the action of underpinning lacks a specific, impactful resolution to drive the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the chalk cliff artist colony is evocative with sensory details like church bells and windswept cliffs, but the atmosphere of "cheerful gloom" feels inconsistently applied and underutilized in enhancing character motivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but leans on generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats; metaphors like "serpentine ribbon" feel overused, lacking fresh perspective or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but feels forced in places; lacks lingering depth or a deliberate sense of brevity, with style occasionally hindering clarity through repetitive phrasing.</comment>
