<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on repetitive phrases and generic descriptors like "haunting melody"; lacks originality with predictable tropes of haunted settings and lost genius, showing little unique style or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles to cohesively integrate disparate elements like folk medicines and hacking; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and it lacks a lingering thought or creative depth.</comment>
