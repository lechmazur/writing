<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between photographing vanishing trades and the silent revolution feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The temporal anomaly study setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of mystery, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and action feels underdeveloped, missing immersive depth.</comment>
