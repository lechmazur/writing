<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Aria's sincerity as a rebel is stated but not deeply explored; her motivation to preserve traditions feels surface-level and lacks personal stakes or nuance in her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between actions and outcomes are vague, and pacing suffers from over-description at the expense of progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The haunted passage and storm timeframe create a fitting atmosphere, with some evocative sensory details, but the tone of bitterness feels forced and inconsistently woven into the setting's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through Aria's resolve, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery is present but often clich√©d, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable tropes of haunted passages and rebellion without subversion; sensory details are generic, and the writing style feels formulaic with overused metaphors like "shadows dancing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative; the style is overly ornate at times, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength.</comment>
