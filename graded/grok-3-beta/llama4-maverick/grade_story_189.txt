<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a desire to restore the world, but the "bright-eyed" attribute feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping personality or actions; reactions to the phone booth key are symbolic but not revealing of nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the connection between decoding star maps and exposing elite overcharge is tenuous and lacks logical cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement setting is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere supports the mystery, yet the post-war timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected from the setting's potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with themes of transparency, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet predictable, lacking subtext or memorable craft beyond surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d tropes of hidden chambers and ancient maps without subversion; writing lacks individual style, feeling formulaic with generic descriptors like "bright sunlight" and stated emotions over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
