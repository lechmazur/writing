<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to outrun a prophecy is clear but lacks depth; the "unsettled" trait feels surface-level and doesn't distinctly shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the prophecy as a driver, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The deserted beach and seashell create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the seashell, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending lacks a strong punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; language feels generic with overused phrases like "weight lift from shoulders," lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion, but style is uninspired, and brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
