<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the "rattled exorcist" trait feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping actions or voice, with motivation to entwine science and wonder stated but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc; the series of puzzles drives the story, but pacing feels rushed, and the resolution lacks emotional weight or surprise within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is moderately evocative with sensory details like sandalwood, but the psychic research facility setting feels underutilized, and the tone of coy aggression is inconsistently applied to enhance mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or memorable subtext; the central conflict is present but underdeveloped, and the writing style is functional but fails to "show" over "tell" key emotions or developments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by generic descriptors and predictable progression; the narrative lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, feeling formulaic and without a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite incorporating assigned elements; the story feels forced around them, lacks depth, and fails to leave a lingering impression or question for the reader.</comment>
