<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced and overly abstract; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect links between actions and outcomes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the cyberpunk setting offers some originality, metaphors like "prison walls of shame" are clich√©d; emotional resonance feels surface-level with generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward overwrought prose; lacks lingering depth or a compelling takeaway beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
