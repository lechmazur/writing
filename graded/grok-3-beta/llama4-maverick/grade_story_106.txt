<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the sullen farmer's transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation beyond a sudden epiphany. The attribute of being "objectively biased" is mentioned but not explored in a meaningful way.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent but feels forced; the connection between stamps, quilt, and erasing boundaries is tenuous and lacks logical progression. Pacing is rushed within the word limit, undermining a complete arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underwater city power station is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully support the character's motivation or the story's tone of borrowed valor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some symbolism with stamps and quilts, emotional resonance is weak due to telling rather than showing. The ending feels predictable and lacks a deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic metaphors and predictable transformation tropes. Emotional handling is surface-level, and the narrative lacks a distinct style, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, and the narrative lacks a lingering impact or creative depth.</comment>
