<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to overcome prejudice is present but underdeveloped; the professional cuddler’s personality lacks depth and distinct voice, feeling more like a vehicle for the concept than a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels forced and incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect links between the chance encounter and transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar setting is evocative and ties to the tone of decay, but sensory details are generic (e.g., "scent of rust"), and the atmosphere only partially supports the character’s internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; symbolism of the ticket punch feels heavy-handed, and the ending is predictable rather than impactful, with little showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive phrases (e.g., "decay," "unspoken rules"); metaphors are clichéd, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than nuanced, lacking originality or a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated rather than organic to the narrative, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, leaving little lasting impression.</comment>
