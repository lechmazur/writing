<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation for connection is clear, but the solemn orchardist lacks depth and distinct voice; reactions to the child and key feel surface-level and predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed and incomplete within the word limit; the action of "x-out" is vague and lacks concrete impact on the narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cyberpunk rooftop garden setting is evocative and supports the tone of disconnection, but sensory details are sparse and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with themes of connection, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the key feels forced and lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but leans on generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats; lacks nuanced human emotion and fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constructed around them rather than using them organically; lacks lingering depth or creative spark.</comment>
