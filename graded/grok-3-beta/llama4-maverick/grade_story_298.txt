<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lin's portrayal as a chameleon stage actor lacks depth; the "rationally impulsive" trait feels superficial and inconsistently applied to their actions. Motivation to weave emotional honesty is stated but not convincingly shown through behavior or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between solving a cold-case mystery and the performance feels tenuous. Pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions between introspection and action, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace reimagined as a theatre is evocative, and sensory details like aged wood and dust motes are effective. However, the post-oil timeframe feels disconnected from the palace setting, and the atmosphere only partially supports Lin's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact but falls short due to telling rather than showing emotions. Imagery like the doll's dress as a symbol of transience is present but underdeveloped. The ending lacks a strong punch, feeling more hopeful than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable tropes of mystery and redemption without subversion. Sensory details are generic at times, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced. The style lacks a distinct voice, leaning toward formulaic prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While some assigned elements are integrated, the story lacks cohesion and depth. The brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and the style hinders clarity with overly ornate descriptions. It fails to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
