<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the vendetta driving the candy sculptor's actions, but the personality lacks depth beyond the rebellion focus; the "precisely creative" trait feels surface-level and underexplored in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the counterattack and hidden continent discovery lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is vividly realized as a symbol of despair turned defiance, enhancing the tone of ardent scorn, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the rebellion theme, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the locket is intriguing but underdeveloped for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a candy sculptor in rebellion is unique, the narrative leans on predictable resistance tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions lack nuanced subtext, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of hope, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
