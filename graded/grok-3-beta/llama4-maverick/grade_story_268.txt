<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand the price of war is clear but lacks depth or personal stakes; the "subdued" trait feels underexplored and doesn't distinctly shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the vigilante mastering Kato, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between tracking distortions and the broader goal is vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the mirror or war theme feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with the mirror's distortions reflecting inner change, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending lacks a strong, memorable resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like "screaming silence" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than evoked through nuanced detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion, but style lacks clarity and depth; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
