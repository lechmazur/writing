<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear, but the "glamorous undertaker" trait feels superficial and underexplored, lacking depth in personality or distinct voice beyond generic reverence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is repetitive and lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of elongating preparation is central but feels static, with no significant progression or conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Setting of a social network archive feels disconnected from the undertaker’s work and lacks sensory detail; atmosphere of jubilant remorse is stated but not vividly evoked through the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional impact or subtext; while the theme of tradition is present, it’s overtly stated rather than shown through nuanced action or imagery, resulting in a flat narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive phrasing about tradition and patience; metaphors like "myth of ordinariness" are vague and overused, lacking originality or genuine emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Story struggles to cohesively integrate assigned elements, feeling more like a list of concepts than a unified narrative; lacks depth or lingering impact despite some creative intent.</comment>
