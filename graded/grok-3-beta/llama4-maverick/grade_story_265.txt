<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the deputy's impassive and personally impersonal nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to witness grace feels vague and lacks grounding in personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the oil change feels irrelevant to the core narrative, and pacing is uneven with an abrupt shift to the bees' interaction. The arc lacks a strong resolution despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the lush orchard in a cathedral is evocative and well-described with sensory details, enhancing the mystical tone. However, the connection to the oil change timeframe feels forced and disrupts atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the twist tie and bees, but emotional resonance is limited by overt telling rather than showing. The ending feels more descriptive than purposeful or satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic mystical tropes around bees and echoes without subversion. Language occasionally veers into purple prose, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements often feel forced rather than integral. Style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the story lacks a lingering depth or question beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
