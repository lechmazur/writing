<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to master time is intriguing but underdeveloped; the "polite bandit" trait feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the chip as a goal, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between hobbling and harp notes are tenuous and incoherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on overused metaphors ("fabric of reality") and generic descriptors; lacks originality in tone and shows little nuanced emotion or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
