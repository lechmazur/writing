<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tracking shooting stars and resolving the historical wrong is tenuous and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall create a vivid atmosphere, and sensory details like the roar of water are effective, but the setting's connection to the character's motivation feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with the concept of closure, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; lacks subtext or deeper meaning, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; lacks a lingering impact or creative depth, making the brevity seem like a limitation.</comment>
