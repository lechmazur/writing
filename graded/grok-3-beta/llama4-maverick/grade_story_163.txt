<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels repetitive and overly symbolic, with pacing that rushes emotional beats; the detour and unification action are logical but lack significant impact within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are present but generic, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character's journey and tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive metaphors (clouds, fragments) and generic descriptors; lacks originality in tone and emotional nuance, leaning on stated feelings rather than subtext or fresh perspectives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but feels forced around assigned elements; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
