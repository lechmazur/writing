<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the illusionist's "casually intense" attribute feels mentioned rather than embodied, and motivation to learn the language of the heart lacks depth or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while the action of rekindling drives the narrative, the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details of the temple and understory, but the setting's connection to the timeframe feels arbitrary and underexplored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic mystical tropes and overly ornate language; metaphors like "gentle rain" feel clich√©d, lacking fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length seems a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
