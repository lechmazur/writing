<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the labyrinth architect's crisis feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and incomplete; connections between elements like the radio signals and the crisis are tenuous and lack logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with the pirate radio and archive setting, but sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse; the tone of desperate hope is inconsistent at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with unspoken bonds but lacks emotional resonance; imagery is present but often generic, and the ending feels unresolved without purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept but relies on predictable patterns and stated emotions rather than nuanced showing; metaphors like "becoming one with the labyrinth" feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; elements feel forced together rather than organically integrated, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth rather than showcasing deliberate brevity.</comment>
