<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the "ruthless" trait of the flower arranger feels tacked on without clear influence on actions or motivations, and her intellectual spontaneity lacks depth in portrayal beyond initiating conversation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc; the road trip and conversations drive the story, but the resolution feels predictable and lacks tension or stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and ties to the rock art theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the characters' motivations or the watcher's burden concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some subtext with the watcher's burden, emotional resonance is weak, and the writing relies on telling rather than showing, with dialogue feeling somewhat stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable patterns and generic descriptors; the narrative lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, and the tone shifts slightly, suggesting a lack of distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but not in a way that elevates the narrative, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
