<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the burnt-out general's motivations are hinted at but lack depth or specificity, failing to fully reveal personality through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there is a vague arc, the connection between beginning and end feels forced, and pacing is rushed, undermining coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with the evocative Dark Matter Diner setting, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic elements like seaweed, but emotional resonance is weak, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats; metaphors lack freshness, and the narrative feels somewhat formulaic despite unique elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
