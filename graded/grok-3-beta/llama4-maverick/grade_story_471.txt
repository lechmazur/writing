<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's recklessness is present but underdeveloped; motivation to map ghost towns feels surface-level and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory. First-person voice is distinct but not compellingly unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels rushed and incomplete within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is weak, and pacing struggles with abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the misty funfair is evocative and supports the mood, with sensory details like mist and music enhancing atmosphere, but the connection to character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance but over-relies on telling rather than showing; ending feels forced, and literary devices like symbolism of the lens are heavy-handed and predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or creative spark, resulting in a forgettable narrative.</comment>
