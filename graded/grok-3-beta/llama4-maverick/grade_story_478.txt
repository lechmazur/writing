<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the midwife's "openly secretive" nature feels contradictory and underdeveloped, lacking depth in motivation beyond the surface-level quest for memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there is a discernible arc, the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the diaries and memory recovery lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The setting of the orchard island in a maelstrom is evocative, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of dissonant calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; imagery like "pages fluttering like wounded birds" is striking, but emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic descriptors and predictable self-discovery tropes; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often overused, and emotional handling lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks the polish needed for a lasting impression.</comment>
