<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Karaâ€™s impulsively thoughtful nature is evident in her actions, but her motivations lack depth beyond the immediate goal; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped due to limited dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the resolution via charcoal spirals strains coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater city laboratory is vividly rendered with sensory details like bioluminescent ghosts, enhancing atmosphere; however, the social upheaval above feels underexplored and disconnected from the immediate setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (charcoal spirals, fractured grace) add layers, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is original, some metaphors (e.g., "ember, fragile yet guarded") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but style sometimes overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so, fitting the brief length as a choice.</comment>
