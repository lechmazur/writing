<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Raghav’s transition from city planner to doomsday prepper is intriguing, but his motivations feel somewhat surface-level, lacking deeper emotional nuance; his actions align with preparation, yet his inner conflict lacks a distinct voice or profound revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the handshake; connections between elements are logical, though the broker's role feels underexplored, disrupting coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative and complements the tone of daring caution, with sensory details like moist soil enhancing atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and object (ink blotter) feels tenuous, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Raghav’s internal struggle, with effective symbolism in the constellations and ink blotter; yet, the ending feels only partially satisfying, and the subtext of authenticity lacks deeper exploration within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "fear wearing tactical boots") feel slightly overused; emotional handling shows nuance, but the narrative occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels reasonably cohesive with creative use of elements like the ink blotter as a compass; however, the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profoundly memorable question or feeling.</comment>
