<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lenora’s patience as a librarian shapes her deliberate, reflective actions, and her motivation to reconcile with Soren is clear, but their emotional depth feels underdeveloped within the word limit; Soren’s characterization lacks nuance beyond regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from conflict to tentative reconciliation is present but feels rushed at the climax; the sticker sheet as a treaty is creative yet not fully integrated into a cohesive resolution, leaving some cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall and memory-reclaimed timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like gears whispering and copper light; however, the setting occasionally overshadows character interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the siblings’ silent reconciliation and uses potent symbolism with the sticker sheet, but the dialogue is sparse and the ending, while poignant, lacks a fully satisfying emotional punch; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the steampunk elements and sibling conflict are somewhat trope-heavy, the sticker sheet as a reconciliation tool offers originality; metaphors like “savage grace” are fresh but occasionally overextended, and emotional nuance feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style sometimes veers into overwrought language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling but lacks profound depth.</comment>
