<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to extinguish self-deception is clear and drives the narrative, but the bruised fighterâ€™s personality lacks deeper nuance beyond surface-level pain and determination; voice is distinct yet not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a strong beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit; pacing is effective, though the connection between chisel strikes and dream closure feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dusty attic with clockwork animals is vividly realized with sensory details (rust oil, tin feathers) that enhance atmosphere and complement the tone of introspection; setting deeply supports the mood and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (clay shard, clockwork animals) evokes reflection on truth and deception; ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is slightly muted by overt exposition over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in concept and imagery, with fresh metaphors, but occasional over-elaborate phrasing borders on purple prose; emotional nuance is present but not consistently deep, risking a formulaic feel in parts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements; style supports clarity, and brief length feels deliberate, though depth of lingering impact is slightly limited by surface-level emotional resolution.</comment>
