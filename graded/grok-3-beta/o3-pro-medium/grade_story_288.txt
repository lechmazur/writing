<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters Rowan and Yara are distinct, with motivations tied to freedom and legacy, but their development feels surface-level due to the word limit; more depth in reactions and dialogue would elevate their portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between quarantine and the sculpture’s creation lacks stronger causal links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ozone monitoring station is vividly rendered with sensory details like "frost-squeaking ramp," enhancing atmosphere, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly ancillary to the main action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on freedom’s cost through symbolism of the sculpture, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like paddleboarding and blacksmithing, but some metaphors ("sang in wind") feel overused, and emotional resonance could be more nuanced rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering idea of freedom’s price, but stylistic choices occasionally overcomplicate clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
