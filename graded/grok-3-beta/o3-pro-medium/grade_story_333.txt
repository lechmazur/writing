<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s portrayal as a sincere rebel is clear, and her motivation to preserve traditions aligns with her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single trait, and her voice feels somewhat generic despite personal revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc within the word limit, and the action of theorizing drives the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms are evocatively paired, with sensory details like rain and lightning enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and object could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Mara’s confrontation of fear, with effective use of symbolism in the carvings and note, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in its ghostly blueprint concept, metaphors like “bitterness braided” feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is present but not fully developed, occasionally leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
