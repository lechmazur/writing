<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lorin's motivation to map silence and resolve as a hushed necromancer is intriguing but underdeveloped; his reactions to the baseball cap carry emotional weight, yet his distinct voice feels muted amid dense imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from exploration to catharsis is present but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between actions and the concept of resolve are poetic but not always logically clear, leading to uneven pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone and supporting Lorin's motivation; however, the timeframe "between sets" feels underexplored in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through memory and loss, with strong imagery and symbolism around cinema and resolve, but the ending lacks full satisfaction due to abrupt closure; subtext is present but not consistently layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of necromancy and cartography, some metaphors (e.g., "projector rattling") feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on explicit statement rather than nuanced showing; tone shifts slightly with tech elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the dense style sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling of melancholy, though the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
