<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dario’s dual identity as a factory worker with cosmic powers is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; they feel more symbolic than personal, limiting emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the ritual driving transformation, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the spreadsheet transformation, seem abrupt and unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terrace over an abyss and factory setting blend effectively to create a haunting, surreal atmosphere, with strong sensory details like “metallic dusk”; however, the tone occasionally overreaches into melodrama, undermining immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through cosmic imagery and subtext of liberation, but the ending feels overly triumphant and lacks nuance; literary devices like gearwheel nebulae are striking yet sometimes overextended, risking distraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic powers in a mundane setting is original, metaphors like “footprints of doubt” feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies; individual style is present but inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of possibility, but overly ornate language occasionally obscures clarity, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
