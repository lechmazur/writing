<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct, with Mason's apologetic nature and past violence shaping his motivations, but Calliope's depth feels underdeveloped beyond her role as a symbol of resilience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; staging accidental meetings drives the narrative, though the resolution lacks a strong causal link to prior actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
