<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marlo's joviality is inconsistently portrayed against his fervent indifference, creating a muddled personality; motivation to tame darkness feels abstract and lacks personal grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning and resolution, but the connection between taming darkness and the earringâ€™s transformation feels tenuous; pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The attic setting is vividly detailed and complements the tone of fervent indifference; sensory elements like rattling glass and train whistles enhance immersion effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., captive sunbeam) adds depth, but emotional resonance is limited by detached character reactions; ending feels purposeful yet lacks impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but overall style borders on purple prose with overly ornate phrasing; emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity; lingering thought is present but not profound.</comment>
