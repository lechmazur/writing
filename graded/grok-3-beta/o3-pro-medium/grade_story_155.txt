<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marin's portrayal as an underwater welder is intriguing but underdeveloped; his "patiently impatient" trait feels more descriptive than integral to his actions or decisions, and his motivation lacks depth beyond wielding power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with timelines crossing as a driving concept, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the cause-effect of pressing buttons lacks specificity, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken planetarium-night club setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (bass, brine, ozone), enhancing the atmosphere of inherited mystery, though the connection between setting and timelines feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (buttons as fate, timelines unraveling) evoke thought, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character depth; subtext exists but lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending timelines and settings, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptors (e.g., "warm salt") feel generic, and emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative element integration, and the brief length suits the surreal tone, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of choice, though not deeply impactful.</comment>
