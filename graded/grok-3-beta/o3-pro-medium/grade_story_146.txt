<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mirissa's portrayal as a faux fortune teller with real visions shapes her secretive yet daring nature, but her motivations lack deeper personal stakes beyond curiosity, weakening emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with exploration driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between flute-playing and city-wide impact are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cemetery and archive setting enhances the eerie, mystical tone, with vivid sensory details like mossy silence and warm dust; however, the connection between setting and planting timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (flute as voice of lost tongues) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by limited character depth; the ending satisfies but lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "darkness polite") feel forced, and emotional depiction occasionally leans on stating rather than showing, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the flute and archive, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
