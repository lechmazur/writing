<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jiro's motivation to expose structural failures aligns with his restless nature, but his personality lacks depth beyond plot function; his voice feels indistinct despite unique traits like stitching conspiracies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the lantern discovery driving a logical resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some causal links are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The biodome on Mars is vividly rendered with sensory details like red dust and steel ribs, enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and lantern feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on corporate neglect through subtext, and the lantern's symbolism is potent, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully impactful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively with creative intent, leaving a lingering question of endurance, but overly ornate language at times hinders clarity, and depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
