<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Selene’s portrayal as a coy spy is intriguing, with her borrowed valor and deceptive nature shaping her actions, but her internal conflict and motivation lack deeper exploration, feeling somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the reversed time method feels convoluted and disrupts pacing; cause and effect are present but not always seamless within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch’s potion brewery setting is vivid and enhances the mystical atmosphere, with sensory details like glowing greenhouses and bubbling cauldrons, though the timeframe of the morning paper feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Selene’s transformation, with strong imagery and symbolism around the loose button, but the ending feels slightly rushed and lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on borrowed valor and shapeshifting, some metaphors (e.g., “newsprint skin”) feel slightly overused, and the tone occasionally shifts, lacking consistent originality in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like reversed time and mended fences, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
