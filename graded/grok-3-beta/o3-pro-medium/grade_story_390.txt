<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lin’s calm demeanor as an assassin is intriguing, but her motivation lacks depth; the “figuratively literal” trait feels gimmicky rather than revealing, and her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the prophecy-spinning driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven, and some causal links, like the butterfly’s role, are more whimsical than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, and the dawn timeframe enhances the ethereal mood; however, the connection between setting and the botanical press feels somewhat tenuous.</comment>
