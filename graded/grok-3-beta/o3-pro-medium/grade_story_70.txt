<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bartholomew's uptight nature is well-defined through precise actions like unrolling parchment, but his motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" feels abstract and underdeveloped, lacking deeper backstory or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the bulb's glow and empathy transformation isn't fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting on a hill of gravestones is vividly realized with sensory details like mist and moonflowers, enhancing the eerie, transformative atmosphere and complementing the story's tone of buried optimism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (bulb as empathy) evoke thought, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of Bartholomewâ€™s transformation rather than showing nuanced reactions; the ending feels purposeful yet slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh (bulb sketching constellations), the story leans on gothic tropes without significant subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the bulb and greenhouse, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
