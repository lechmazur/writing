<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious nature and rebellious streak are intriguing, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; his actions, while poetic, feel more symbolic than driven by a personal, grounded arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven; the cause-effect of the weathervane and comet light feels more mystical than logical, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory detail; the setting powerfully enhances the tone of desolation and hope, though the timeframe's impact is less clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on renewal and choice, with striking imagery and symbolism; however, the ending feels slightly unresolved, and the central conflict lacks sharper focus within the tight narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique perspective with fresh metaphors, avoiding most clich√©s; yet, some language veers into overly ornate territory, and emotional resonance occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope; however, the style sometimes sacrifices clarity for poetic flourish, and the brevity feels slightly limiting to full impact.</comment>
