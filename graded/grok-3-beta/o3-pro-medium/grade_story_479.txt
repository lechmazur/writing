<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lucian Cortez's portrayal as a glamorous undertaker is intriguing, with a distinct voice in the first-person narration, but the motivation to honor storytellers feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of elongating cloth driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between social media and traditional practices is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere of jubilant remorse is well-captured through vivid sensory details like coral-rose paint and the humming mixer, enhancing the setting, though the social network archive feels underexplored as a setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending and effective metaphors like the "glitter-smeared ferryman," but the central conflict is subtle and lacks sharp tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective on grief and tradition, some metaphors (e.g., "ribbon of metallic honey") feel overly ornate, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering emotional note, but overly complex language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
