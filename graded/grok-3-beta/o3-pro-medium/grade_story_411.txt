<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Axle's portrayal as a sentient car mechanic is intriguing, and his longing for companionship emerges as a poignant motivation late in the story; however, his personality lacks depth beyond the mechanical metaphors, and his voice feels more symbolic than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the action of gathering fragments drives the narrative; yet, pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally obscured by dense imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and river of stars create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the tone of exultant grief; sensory details are evocative, though at times overly ornate, and the setting strongly supports the concept of infinity, if not always the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on unspoken desires and uses striking metaphors (e.g., apple-comets), with a satisfying ending; however, the central conflict feels understated, and subtext, while present, is sometimes buried under excessive symbolism rather than shown through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its surreal premise and imagery, avoiding overt clich√©s, but metaphors occasionally feel forced or generic (e.g., oil as tears); emotional resonance is present but undermined by stated rather than shown feelings, and style borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite numerous elements, with creative integration of surreal concepts; however, the dense style hinders clarity at times, and while it leaves a lingering thought, the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
