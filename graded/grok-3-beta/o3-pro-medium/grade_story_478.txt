<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mirla’s critical nature as a midwife is well-defined and shapes her actions, but her deeper emotional transformation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the climax of recovering memories is rushed compared to the descriptive buildup, slightly disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orchard island in a maelstrom is vividly realized with strong sensory details (e.g., trembling fruit, roaring water), enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through themes of critique and compassion, with striking imagery (e.g., diaries as wounded birds), but the ending feels more poetic than emotionally conclusive, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers an original setting and concept, some metaphors (e.g., “gentle lightning”) feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering theme of self-delivery, but overly ornate language at times obscures clarity, making the brief length feel more stylistic than deliberate.</comment>
