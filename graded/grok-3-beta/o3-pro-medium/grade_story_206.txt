<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marrow Vela's vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are well-defined and drive her actions, but her sudden shift toward forgiveness feels inconsistent with the established bitterness, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuance in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains a clear arc within the word limit, with the trail of photographs driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution of the Regent's guilt seems overly convenient, undermining logical cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting and sensory details of sugar and rebellion create a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone of scorn and Marrow's motivation, though the connection between setting and timeframe could be more distinctly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through imagery of sugar sculptures and betrayal, with strong symbolism in the locket, but the ending feels too neat, lacking lingering tension or deeper subtext to provoke lasting reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of candy as a weapon is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable rebellion tropes without sufficient subversion, and some metaphors, like "glassy serpents," feel slightly overused rather than uniquely crafted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
