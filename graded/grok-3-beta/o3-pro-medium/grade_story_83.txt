<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to "sow seeds of a better tomorrow" is intriguing but underdeveloped; the "suspiciously trusting" trait feels forced and lacks depth in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed resolution; connections between action (excel) and method (tracing wick patterns) are creative yet somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the mirrored labyrinth is vividly evoked and enhances the mysterious tone; sensory details are strong, though timeframe (leaf raking) feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (mirrors, Janus Moth) are striking and add subtext, but emotional resonance is limited by shallow character depth; ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story shows originality in combining cryptid lore with horticultural themes, but some metaphors (e.g., "history tilt promisingly") feel ornate and generic; tone is consistent but lacks nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so due to underdeveloped stakes.</comment>
