<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bastien’s spirited lumberjack persona is distinct, and his motivation to learn healing traditions aligns with his actions, but his philosophical depth feels underdeveloped, lacking a stronger personal voice or nuanced reaction to the surreal events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc with the revamp action driving change, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the transition from coded letter to menu revision is abrupt, and cause-effect links are occasionally murky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient ossuary turned restaurant is vividly realized with sensory details like marrow scents and bone dust, enhancing the eerie tone of hidden agendas, though the bike rides as timeframe feel less integrated into the atmospheric core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through imagery like fading wounds and forest broths, with strong metaphors, but the ending feels more intriguing than satisfying; subtext is present but not fully layered, and tension resolution is rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., “artillery bloomed where trunks once stood”) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but tone shifts occasionally disrupt individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about timelines, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels somewhat restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
