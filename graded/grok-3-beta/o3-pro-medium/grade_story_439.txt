<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mute courier’s attribute of being unassumingly bold is reflected in subtle actions, but his inner world lacks depth; motivation to find hidden meanings feels stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the comet’s guidance generating a doorway, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution of the opera house awakening is abrupt and unearned within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The storm-battered harbor and run-down opera house create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere with strong sensory details like snowflakes as albino fireflies; the tone of cautious enchantment is well-supported, though the setting’s connection to interdimensional travel feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (ruins as unfinished scores) add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by overt telling over showing; the central theme of hidden meanings is present but not fully layered or provocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like “snow dissolving into sparkling glyphs” are fresh, the story leans on ornate language bordering on purple prose; emotional nuance is present but often explicitly stated, and the narrative arc feels somewhat predictable despite its surreal elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels intentional, but the style’s complexity occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about ruins and codas, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
