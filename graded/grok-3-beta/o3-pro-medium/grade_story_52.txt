<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lio’s hopeful yet discontented nature is clear, and his motivation to confess aligns with his guilt, but his emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, missing a fully distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the confession driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution via crowd reaction seems overly convenient, lacking deeper cause-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant hourglass marketplace is vividly realized with sensory details like sand and spice, enhancing the atmosphere of time slipping away, though the setting’s full potential to mirror Lio’s guilt isn’t exploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Lio’s confession, with effective imagery (sand as time, broken sharpener as guilt), but the ending feels too neat, and subtext is present yet not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique setting, some metaphors (e.g., “peeling guilt like fruit”) feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance is shown but occasionally stated, lacking a fully individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the hourglass and karaoke, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
