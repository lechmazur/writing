<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's phobia and stunt double background are integrated into actions and motivations, but the portrayal lacks depth; the internal conflict feels surface-level and the voice, while distinct, borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the action of triumph, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and some cause-effect links (like the netâ€™s role) are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a pyramid is vividly rendered with sensory details and enhances the mood of mystery; however, the connection between setting and object feels slightly forced, missing deeper synergy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a lingering eerie fascination with strong imagery and subtext around risk and fear, but the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharper resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality with fresh metaphors and a unique premise, but some phrases feel overly ornate, veering into purple prose, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering mood, but style occasionally hinders clarity with overcomplex language, and the short length feels slightly constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
