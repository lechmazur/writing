<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo's confusion as a diplomat is clear and drives his introspection, but his motivation lacks depth beyond abstract musings; reactions to the spare key are intriguing yet underdeveloped in personal impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of liberalizing tied to avian patterns, but pacing feels uneven, and cause-effect links between underground insights and surface negotiations are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like glittering walls and dehumidifier tea, enhancing the mood, though the timeframe of bus rides feels underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through symbolic bird patterns and the counterpoint of hearts, with strong imagery, but the emotional impact is diluted by overwrought language; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of avian messages is original, the story leans on somewhat generic metaphors (hearts pulsing, doors unlocking) and lacks nuanced emotional showing, feeling at times formulaic in its poetic style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the key and birds, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with dense prose; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
