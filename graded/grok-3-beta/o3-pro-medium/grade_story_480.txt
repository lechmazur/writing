<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (curiosity and follower count) is clear but underdeveloped; the protagonist’s indifferent enthusiasm feels more stylistic than personal, lacking depth in voice and reaction to key moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; connections between actions and resolution are imaginative yet rushed, with pacing issues undercutting coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details (dust, bass tremors), effectively enhancing mood, though the setting’s integration with character motivation feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has striking imagery and subtext (memories eating makers), but emotional impact is inconsistent; the ending intrigues yet lacks full satisfaction due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphor and concept (social media exorcist, vinyl stalactites), but some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story shows creative integration of elements and leaves a lingering thought, but cohesion suffers from stylistic overreach; brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, hindering overall clarity.</comment>
