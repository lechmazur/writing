<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation to escape dictation is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond stoic resilience; reactions to the cards and messages lack deeper emotional nuance, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from struggle to boundary via the song is coherent within the word limit, though pacing feels rushed at the marshal's confrontation, and cause-effect of the cardsâ€™ magic lacks grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-war timeframe create a vivid, desolate mood with strong sensory detail like "ash-grey dawn," though the tideless sea feels underutilized in enhancing action or character depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of musical boundaries is original, metaphors like "stubborn sparks" feel slightly generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated longing rather than nuanced subtext, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, and the lingering theme of freedom is present, but overall cohesion suffers from underdeveloped character depth and rushed resolution.</comment>
