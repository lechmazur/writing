<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kavi's motivation to preserve indigenous dances is clear and drives his actions, but his personality as a nimble locksmith feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice or depth beyond the plot's demands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolutions and unclear cause-effect links between the storm of secrets and the orchard's mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting and atmosphere of jaded wonder are evocative, with strong sensory details like apples chiming as bells, though the physically metaphysical storm feels inconsistently integrated into the world’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Kavi’s mission and uses vivid imagery like moonlight slivers, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying impact, and the central conflict feels abstract and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality with the orchard and dance preservation, metaphors like “nervous moth” feel generic, and the tone occasionally shifts unnaturally, hinting at formulaic construction over nuanced style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels moderately cohesive with creative use of elements like the floating orchard, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
