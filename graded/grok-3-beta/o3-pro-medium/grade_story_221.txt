<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's role as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer shapes her actions, but her motivation to escape her mother’s shadow feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution. Her distinct voice is present in the first-person narration, though it occasionally verges on overwrought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—rushed in emotional beats and overly descriptive elsewhere. Cause and effect are logical, though the action of arousing spirits lacks a stronger narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (rust, dust, popcorn smell), enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting Mara’s motivation. However, the connection between setting and timeframe feels tenuous, slightly diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood through imagery and symbolism (amber, thawing heart), with a satisfying ending. Yet, the central conflict feels muted, and the theme of personal rebellion lacks deeper subtext or resonance beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "confetti too tired to shine") feel forced, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing. The style is distinct but occasionally slips into purple prose, undermining clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone. However, overly ornate language hinders clarity at times, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound question or feeling to carry forward.</comment>
