<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arin Kestrel's selflessness as a musician is evident in his dedication to the crew and leviathans, but his inner emotional depth remains underdeveloped, lacking a distinct personal voice or nuanced conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at key emotional beats, and the connection between music and migration mapping lacks deeper logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting and cosmic atmosphere are vividly rendered with strong sensory details like solar winds and chimes, though the timeframe's impact on tone feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism (e.g., vinyl record as trust) create impact, but emotional resonance is diluted by overt exposition rather than showing; the ending satisfies but lacks profound lingering effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of musical star-charts is original, some metaphors (e.g., "bruised swan") feel forced, and emotional descriptions occasionally lack nuance, verging on formulaic expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of trust, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
