<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exiled prince's loneliness as a core motivation is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single trait; reactions to the apothecary and mortar feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the snowstorm encounter driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between the key and emotional transformation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and winter timeframe create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere that enhances the theme of isolation; sensory details like dust motes and snow are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the prince's realization about loneliness, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly pat, and dialogue, while sparse, lacks distinctiveness; central conflict is present but resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While some metaphors like "dust motes as captive stars" are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar exile tropes without subversion; emotional handling shows nuance in places but often states feelings directly, lacking consistent originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the mortar and snowstorm, leaving a lingering sense of solace, but style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity; brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
