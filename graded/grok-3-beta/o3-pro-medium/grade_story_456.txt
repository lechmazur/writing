<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mirelle’s portrayal as a morbid florist is intriguing, with her personality subtly shaped by decay and renewal, but her motivation to understand cosmic cycles feels slightly detached from her actions at times, lacking deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven; the cosmic connection drives the story, yet some causal links between actions and outcomes are vague or rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the mystical atmosphere and complementing Mirelle’s quest, though the timeframe’s integration feels more symbolic than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its cosmic and decay imagery, with strong metaphors and subtext about renewal, but the ending feels more poetic than emotionally satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending floristry with cosmic themes, with fresh metaphors like “stellar compost,” but some language veers into purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the style supports its mystical tone, but it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact, feeling more like an exercise in imagery than a complete narrative.</comment>
