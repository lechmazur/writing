<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a "dutiful sentinel" is clear, but the internal conflict feels underdeveloped; the shift to destroying the heliophore lacks deeper personal stakes or distinct voice in the first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the destruction driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the photosynthesis lab integrates well with the concept of light and stories, and sensory details like "lightless smoke" enhance atmosphere, but the restaurant scene feels tonally disjointed from the lab's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through its metaphor of stories as light, with some striking imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by abstract language, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in its concept of narrative as sustenance for light, with fresh metaphors like "chloroplastic algorithms," but some phrasing feels overly ornate, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about light's return, but the style's complexity occasionally obscures clarity, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
