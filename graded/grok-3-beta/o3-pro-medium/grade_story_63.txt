<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mari's reserved nature and oracle abilities shape her quiet determination, but her internal conflict and voice feel underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is driven by mending the lullaby with a logical arc, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; coherence is maintained, but some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized with sensory details like clinking test tubes and whispering flutes, enhancing the atmosphere; the setting deeply supports the action, though the choir practice timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., embroidered cuffs as legacy) evoke emotion and subtext about art's endurance; the ending is satisfying, but the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like "candle flame" melody are fresh, some descriptors feel slightly generic; the story avoids clich√©s but lacks a fully distinctive style, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story coheres well with creative use of elements like the lullaby's ripple effect; style supports clarity, and the brief length feels deliberate, though it doesn't fully linger with profound depth.</comment>
