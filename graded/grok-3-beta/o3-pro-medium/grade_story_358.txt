<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Graythorn's "purposefully aimless" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to claim a frontier feels clear yet lacks depth in personal stakes. Naya's innocence is compelling but her voice and reactions are somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the riddle driving tension, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax. Cause and effect are logical, though some transitions (e.g., glass melting to corridor) are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse setting is vividly realized with sensory details (hoarfrost hiss, auroral mist) and enhances the tone of sanctified dread. Connection between setting and pharaoh’s fragment feels tenuous, slightly undermining cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes wonder and dread through imagery (black snow, violet sun) and has layers of subtext about fear and discovery. However, dialogue feels stilted, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining arctic and Egyptian motifs, with fresh metaphors (hieroglyphs as beetles). Some descriptions verge on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of wonder. Style is evocative but occasionally overcomplex, obscuring clarity. Brief length suits the tone but limits deeper exploration.</comment>
