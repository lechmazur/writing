<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Florian’s vigilance and punctuality shape his personality well, and his motivation to uncover a conspiracy is clear, though somewhat overshadowed by the personal tragedy which feels underexplored. His sardonic voice is distinct but occasionally forced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the conspiracy driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax. Cause and effect are logical, though some connections (like the peacock pattern) strain coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is vividly rendered and supports the atmosphere, with sensory details like hangar air and propeller spreadsheets. However, the setting’s connection to the orchardist’s grief feels tenuous, and tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through grief and truth-seeking, with strong imagery (peacock tail, bruised harvest). However, the ending feels abrupt, and the central conflict lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact beyond surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story shows originality in combining elements like orchardist and conspiracies, with fresh metaphors (espaliered vines). Yet, some phrases feel ornate, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive despite many elements, with creative integration, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity. It leaves a lingering thought of truth’s triumph, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
