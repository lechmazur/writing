<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Midori's dutiful nature drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the motivation to preserve forbidden poetry. Her reactions to the coil and the risk of contamination are consistent, yet her voice and internal conflict feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the act of contamination driving the narrative forward. However, pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the beginning and end, while present, lacks a stronger emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The capsule hotel and time travel setting are vividly realized with sensory details like the corridor hum and neon-tinged air, enhancing the atmosphere. However, the connection between the setting and the coil feels slightly tenuous, and the tone could better amplify the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Midori's longing and risk-taking, with effective imagery like "sterile river where no soul could drink." Yet, the central conflict's resolution feels underwhelming, and the theme of history's beauty lacks deeper subtext or layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on time travel and memory preservation, some metaphors ("grounded bird that still remembers sky") feel overused. Emotional resonance is present but relies on explicit longing rather than nuanced showing, and the style occasionally borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels intentional. However, the style sometimes obscures clarity with overly poetic phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound question or feeling to carry beyond the narrative.</comment>
