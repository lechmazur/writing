<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eskel’s hesitance and awkwardness are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to restore traditional systems feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of deciphering the postcard driving the story, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the eerie tone of ephemeral rancor and supporting Eskel’s internal conflict; minor disconnect between setting and object integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet tension and uses potent imagery (hermit crabs, orchard sigils), with a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper emotional resonance and subtext; conflict resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers an original setting and concept, some metaphors (e.g., “wind ghosts”) feel slightly overused, and emotional depiction leans toward telling over showing; tone remains consistent but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brevity seems deliberate, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly obscuring clarity; leaves a lingering thought, yet not profoundly impactful.</comment>
