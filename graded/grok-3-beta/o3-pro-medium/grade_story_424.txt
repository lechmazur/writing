<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quillian Bray's motivation to understand sacrifice is clear and ties to his family legacy, but his personality as a "mild zealot of mathematics" feels underdeveloped, lacking distinct voice or consistent zeal in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from seeking meaning to partial revelation is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with dense exposition; cause and effect of chaotic equations influencing moral economies is intriguing yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The strange attractor laboratory setting is vividly realized with sensory details like pine smoke and thrum of glass coils, enhancing the rustic refinement tone and supporting the theme of sacrifice, though timeframe integration feels slightly vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (foreign money as initial conditions, scars of legacy) and subtext about debt and sacrifice evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by over-telling; ending is purposeful yet lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "cracked spine mending in reverse" are fresh, but some language veers into ornate excess; the narrative feels original in concept but occasionally leans on predictable academic-mystic tropes without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative integration, leaving a lingering thought on sacrifice, but overly dense style slightly hinders clarity; brevity feels deliberate yet constrains deeper emotional payoff.</comment>
