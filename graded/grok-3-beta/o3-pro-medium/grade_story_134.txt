<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sudrick's motivation to track cultural evolution is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond curiosity; Daphnil's obnoxious politeness is distinctive but borders on caricature, reducing emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with eavesdropping driving the action logically, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution of the leaking dread lacks full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly described with sensory details like "frozen moonlight," enhancing the playful dread tone, though the setting's connection to laundry cycles feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its concept of waking the unheard, and imagery like "salt ears" is striking, but the emotional impact is muted by inconsistent tension and dialogue that feels overly stylized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining salt crystals with cultural archiving, and metaphors like "linguistic spores" are fresh, though some phrasing feels ornate and Daphnil's politeness verges on clich√© without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the cardboard box, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaborate descriptions; it leaves a lingering thought about unheard voices, though not profoundly.</comment>
