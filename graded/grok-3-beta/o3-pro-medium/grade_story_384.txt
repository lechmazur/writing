<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Viora's frantic nature as a cook is evident, and her motivation to expose illusions is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the assigned role, and her voice isn't distinctly unique in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a discernible arc despite the word limit, and the action of subverting the institution drives the story forward, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility setting enhances the narrative, and sensory details like flour dust and spice scents are evocative, though the timeframe of centuries feels underutilized and occasionally disconnected from the immediate atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending cooking with seismology, avoiding many clich√©s, though some metaphors (e.g., "overbaked crusts") are slightly generic; tone is consistent, but emotional nuance is sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, though style occasionally leans toward ornate over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound emotional depth.</comment>
