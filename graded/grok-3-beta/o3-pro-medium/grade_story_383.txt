<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>General Calder Vox's burnt-out nature is evident, but his motivation and transformation feel somewhat forced and lack depth; Dr. Wey's role as a cognitive cartographer is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the connection between fear's dethronement and the photographs feels conceptually strained and not fully coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
