<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rauan’s shaky nature and mercenary background are evident, but his motivation for peace feels underdeveloped within the tight word count, lacking deeper insight into his transformation from violence to art.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the search for the amber; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the bargain with the muralist lacks depth for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of longing and desolation; the atmosphere strongly supports Rauan’s motivation, though the timeframe’s impact is less distinct.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (amber as memory, cathedral as redemption) evokes emotional depth; the ending is satisfying, but dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, could be sharper for greater impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining elements like the amber spider and cathedral setting, but some metaphors (e.g., “kaleidoscopic wounds”) border on purple prose, and emotional resonance relies occasionally on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of unresolved peace; style supports the narrative but occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity for top-tier publication.</comment>
