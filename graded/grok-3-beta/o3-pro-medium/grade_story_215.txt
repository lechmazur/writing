<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Milo’s rattled nature and inward sociability are present but lack depth in motivation beyond clearing his name, which feels somewhat generic for an exorcist. His voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is intriguing with a clear arc and puzzle-driven progression, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and some cause-effect links (like the salt lattice) are overly convoluted, straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lessons create a unique, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details like clicking metronomes and sparking shoes, enhancing the mood and supporting the concept effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has impact through vivid imagery and a satisfying ending, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions. Subtext is present but not fully layered; central conflict is clear but resolution feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Originality is mixed; the blend of science and spirituality is fresh, but some metaphors (e.g., “coy aggression crystallized”) feel overwrought. Emotional nuance is lacking, and certain descriptors are generic rather than vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity. It leaves a lingering thought, though not deeply profound, and the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
