<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to topple the idol is clear, but the astronomer's personality feels underdeveloped beyond awe; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the veil, making actions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse orchard and ice floes is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like moaning floes and crystal shadows, enhancing atmosphere; tone complements the concept of moral dilemmas effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through moral dilemmas and wonder versus fear, with strong use of symbolism (veil, snowflakes); ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is slightly undercut by overt explanation over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like the veil and snowflake patterns, with fresh metaphors; however, some imagery feels ornate and emotions are occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about wonder; style supports clarity, though brief length occasionally limits depth, feeling more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
