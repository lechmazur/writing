<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Saida’s caution as an archivist shapes her meticulous actions, but her motivation lacks depth beyond surface-level duty; her reactions to the amber rosary are symbolic yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rally drives the plot, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the story achieves a complete arc, though cause-effect links are occasionally tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desert fortress and art fair timeframe are vividly realized with strong sensory details; the atmosphere of ordered disarray complements Saida’s motivation, though some setting-action connections feel incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through cultural preservation themes and uses potent imagery, but the ending feels slightly abrupt; conflict is present but not deeply resolved within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the sand-calligraphy concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., "scorpion across hot stone") feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
