<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brother Kajo's motivation to learn forgotten languages is clear and ties to his weary, timidly loud nature, but his personality lacks depth beyond the mystical; Mora's hunger is introduced late and feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from seeking shelter to influencing storms is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect between buttons and weather shifts is more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The storm chasing headquarters and storm imagery create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like "lightning stitched ragged seams," though the setting's connection to buttons feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism (buttons as language, storms as memory) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by overreliance on abstract concepts over nuanced character reactions; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise is unique, the mystical tone borders on purple prose with phrases like "eons of silent wonder"; metaphors are fresh but occasionally overdone, and emotional depth lacks subtlety, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style leans too heavily on ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of language and nature, though depth feels surface-level.</comment>
