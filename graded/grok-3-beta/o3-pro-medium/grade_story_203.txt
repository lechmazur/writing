<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Father Osric's stage fright is a compelling trait that shapes his internal conflict, but his motivation as an exorcist feels underdeveloped beyond the immediate ritual, lacking deeper personal stakes or backstory to anchor his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the exorcism as a central action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat tenuous, relying heavily on abstract symbolism over concrete resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly realized with strong sensory details like "whispered against the station hull," enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the integration with toy assembly feels incidental and less immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a lingering sense of defiance and hope, with potent imagery like "pressed wildflowers" and "violet of dawn before language," but the central conflict's resolution feels too abrupt, and emotional depth is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and spirituality, some metaphors (e.g., "frost on a window") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like orbital debris and wildflowers, but the style occasionally veers into overwrought language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
