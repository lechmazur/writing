<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear, with the apprentice's bright-eyed enthusiasm and literal nature somewhat reflected in actions, but depth and distinct voice are lacking; reactions feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence with a discernible arc within the word limit, and the concept of grand designs drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some causal links are implied rather than explicit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details (kelp, kerosene, green glow), enhancing the haunted lighthouse setting; tone of brazen calm contrasts effectively with tension, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through imagery, with decent subtext about sacrifice, but the ending lacks full satisfaction, and literary devices, while present, aren't consistently impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases feel ornate, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown; originality is present but not striking enough for top-tier uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of ambition, but style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
