<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleni's timid nature and seraphic quality are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to honor her brother’s promise feels genuine yet lacks depth due to limited exploration of her inner conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with collective healing driving the narrative, but the scoreboard consultation feels contrived and disrupts coherence; pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Greek temple setting and post-factory timeframe create a striking atmosphere of decay and hope, enhanced by evocative imagery; however, sensory details are inconsistently vivid, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through symbolism of stitching and banners, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict feels understated, and subtext is present yet not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining elements, some metaphors (e.g., “rosary of inked memories”) verge on clichéd, and emotional depth relies occasionally on telling rather than showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
