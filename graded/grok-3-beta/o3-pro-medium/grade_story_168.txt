<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maribel’s ruthlessness as a flower arranger is intriguing but underexplored in depth; her intellectual spontaneity feels more performative than integral to her motivations, lacking nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot’s arc feels incomplete, with the connection between flowers, combs, and rock art decoding remaining forced and insufficiently justified within the tight word limit; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and well-paired with the timeframe, enhanced by sensory details like distant festival music; however, the atmosphere only sporadically supports character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (flowers as memory, stones listening) are striking but overextended, diluting emotional impact; the ending feels poetic yet lacks a fully satisfying resolution; subtext is present but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, others (e.g., “rebel queen”) feel clichéd; the narrative perspective is unique but occasionally slips into overly ornate prose, undermining authenticity and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but the style often prioritizes flourish over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly memorable one, given inconsistencies.</comment>
