<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo's tension as a bodyguard is clear, and his motivation to break free is consistent, but his stubbornness feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper insight into his internal struggle. The photograph's symbolism is poignant, yet his voice in dialogue remains somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from confinement to liberation is present but feels rushed within the word limit. The action of ratifying autonomy drives the story, yet cause-effect relationships are occasionally vague, especially regarding Holm's response. Pacing is uneven, with the ending abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly realized with evocative details like silver dust and ruby tomatoes, enhancing the atmosphere of confinement and longing. The tone of serene anger aligns well with the concept, though sensory immersion occasionally wanes in dialogue-heavy moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Milo's rebellion, with strong imagery like Earthrise painting bars gold. However, the central conflict feels underexplored, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks full satisfaction. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique lunar perspective, some metaphors (e.g., "spilled diamonds") feel overused. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, but character reasoning occasionally lacks human complexity. The style is individual yet borders on ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice. It leaves a lingering thought of freedom, though clarity is sometimes hindered by overly poetic language. Overall, it shows promise but needs refinement.</comment>
