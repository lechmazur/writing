<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Garrick's grumpiness is well-established and consistent, shaping his reluctance and tone, but his deeper emotional transformation feels slightly rushed given the word limit, lacking nuanced progression in his internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the stargazing ritual, but pacing feels uneven—some emotional beats are glossed over, and the mandala's transformation could use more grounding in logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like incense and constellations; the setting enhances the mystical tone and complements the concept of trauma, though some connections to Garrick’s crypt roots feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Garrick’s buried grief and uses potent imagery (sand mandala as memory), with a satisfying ending; however, some dialogue feels stilted, and the theme of trauma could be shown more subtly rather than explicitly stated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of crypt and mysticism, some metaphors (e.g., “uprising within”) feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on direct statements rather than nuanced showing; still, the personal style shines through in vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of trauma and stargazing, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not as sharply as top-tier work demands.</comment>
