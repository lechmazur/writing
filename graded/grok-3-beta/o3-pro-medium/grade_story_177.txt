<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Joryn's role as a traveler writing obituaries for the living is intriguing and drives his motivation, but his personality lacks depth beyond the rebellious trait; his reactions and voice feel somewhat archetypal rather than uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of manifesting obituaries driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at key moments, and the labyrinth's logic occasionally disrupts narrative coherence with abrupt shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf and hidden pipe organ chamber create a vivid, surreal atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like ink and thunder scents; however, the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its theme of revolution and lost art, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition rather than nuanced 'showing,' and the ending feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the premise is original, some metaphors (e.g., "obedient dragons") feel overused, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate prose; emotional resonance is present but lacks subtlety, leaning on stated intent over nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates its many elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative thinking, but the style sometimes hinders clarity with dense phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
