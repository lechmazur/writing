<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mallory's portrayal as a pleasant meddler is evident but lacks depth; her motivation to decode symbols feels intriguing yet underdeveloped, missing emotional stakes or backstory to ground her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but coherence suffers from abrupt transitions between hospital and shoreline imagery; pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links are often vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and hospital setting are vividly imagined, with sensory details like "briny antiseptic air" enhancing atmosphere, but the integration of shoreline elements feels forced and inconsistent with the primary setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has moments of evocative imagery and symbolism (e.g., skates as cyphers), but emotional impact is muted by detached narration; the ending is purposeful yet lacks resonance due to insufficient character grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality with its blend of surreal and mundane, metaphors like "rust flaking like dried blood" feel slightly overused; tone is consistent but lacks nuanced emotional depth, risking formulaic surrealism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative element integration, but overly complex imagery hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully, due to underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
