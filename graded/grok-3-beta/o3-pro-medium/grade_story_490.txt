<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "fading caretaker" identity is evocative, but motivation lacks depth beyond a surface fascination with the forbidden; first-person voice is distinct yet reactions feel somewhat detached and inconsistent with emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from discovery to dissolution is present but feels rushed and incomplete within the word limit; cause and effect of hacking archives are logical, yet pacing stumbles with abrupt shifts to existential musings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere of desolation and secrecy in the caravan repair station is vivid with strong sensory details like "salt-stiff wind" and "burnt circuitry," enhancing mood and action, though setting-timeframe connection feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and melancholy with striking imagery like "luminous algorithms," but ending feels more stylistic than purposeful; subtext is present yet central conflict remains vague and unresolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original imagery and perspective are notable, but some metaphors like "newborn galaxy" feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally prioritizes flair over clarity; length feels like a limitation, and lingering impact is present but not fully realized.</comment>
