<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra's compassionate nature as a mage is evident in her tender approach to banishing ghosts, but her deeper motivations and personal voice feel underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking nuanced internal conflict or distinct dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the banishing action driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between the locket and submarine hull alignment are not fully logical or fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret agent center beneath Reykjavik and stormy atmosphere enhance the eerie tone effectively, with vivid sensory details like "salty mist" and "stubborn stars," though the setting's connection to family history feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the brutal mercy of banishing ghosts and uses striking imagery like "digital spores," but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the central theme of unspoken wisdom feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors like "rivets pulse like stubborn stars" are fresh, the story leans on genre tropes of haunted relics and secret histories without significant subversion, and emotional depth occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, achieving cohesion despite its brevity, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is muted by unresolved thematic threads.</comment>
