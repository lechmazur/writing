<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gravedigger’s steady and whimsical nature is clear, and his motivation to preserve ritual practices is consistent, but his personality lacks deeper nuance or internal conflict, making his voice somewhat flat despite evocative actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present yet not fully impactful, with some logical flow disrupted by overly poetic detours.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Aztec temple and sensory details like sand and wind create an immersive atmosphere that supports the tone of raucous silence, though the setting’s integration with character motivation occasionally feels more decorative than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative mood with strong imagery and subtext about life and death, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict feels underdeveloped despite a clear theme of overlapping worlds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective on ritual and memory, some metaphors (e.g., “worlds folding upon worlds”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the magnifying glass and overlapping worlds, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
