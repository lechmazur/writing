<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Harker's fierce loyalty to Captain Alys is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks deeper nuance beyond this trait; his voice feels somewhat indistinct despite the motivation to master meditation techniques.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the shift from meditation to intercepting the broadcast, but the pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between comedy and meditation is underdeveloped, causing minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details (moth wings, static, skyline); however, the tone of sanctified dread occasionally overpowers the setting's potential for subtlety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of tension and reflection through its imagery and subtext, with effective metaphors like moths as prayers, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict lacks full resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in blending meditation with coded comedy, it leans on overly ornate language and generic descriptors at times, diminishing authenticity; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the tower and meditation, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with dense prose; it leaves a lingering thought, yet feels constrained rather than deliberately brief.</comment>
