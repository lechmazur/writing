<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Felix's portrayal as a lucky gambler is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to defy hopelessness feels inconsistent with his cynical actions, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc and logical progression within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations at the end; the duplication action drives the story, though coherence suffers from abrupt ghost interactions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse and future timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like peeling paint and ghostly breaths; tone of cheerful despair aligns well, though setting could deepen character motives further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on corruption and hopelessness with strong imagery and subtext; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and tension around Felix's plan feels underexplored within the tight limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the narrative offers some originality with the botanical diary and seed vault, metaphors occasionally feel forced or overused; emotional resonance lacks nuance, with despair stated more than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering question about luck and power, though brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
