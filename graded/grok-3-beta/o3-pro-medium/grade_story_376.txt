<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ember's motivation to archive emotional patterns is intriguing and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular focus, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reactions that reveal more about her inner world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between actions and outcomes lacks sharper cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Viking longhouse and sensory details like torchlight and oak create an immersive atmosphere that supports the tone of fierce repose, though the setting's connection to the amber inkwell feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through subtext like the earl's grief and employs strong imagery, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict remains somewhat understated for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers originality in archiving emotions via an inkwell, some metaphors (e.g., "moths courting a silent flame") feel slightly overused, and emotional handling occasionally leans toward explicit statement over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the amber inkwell, and the brief length seems deliberate, but the style sometimes veers into overly ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and broader impact.</comment>
