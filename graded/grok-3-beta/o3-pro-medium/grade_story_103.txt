<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric’s weatherbeaten nature shapes his weary resilience, but his motivation to hush regret feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional progression; reactions to the brass knocker are intriguing yet lack a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of appreciating a pattern driving progression, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and some mirrored reflection transitions are abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef setting is vividly evoked with sensory details like roaring surf, enhancing the tone of joyful agony; however, the mirrored reflection timeframe feels inconsistently integrated with the physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (mirrored reflection as unchosen life) evoke emotional depth and subtext about regret, but the ending feels slightly forced, and the central conflict's resolution lacks full emotional punch within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the mirrored corridor offers an original twist, some metaphors (e.g., “waves smashing like applause”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability in tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the brass knocker, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering sense of sacrifice, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
