<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Deputy Mariel Cruz’s impassive nature and personal impersonality are well-defined, but her motivation to witness grace feels underdeveloped and slightly disconnected from her actions, lacking deeper emotional resonance or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and end, but the pacing feels uneven; the focus on the orchard and bees overshadows the oil change context, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lush orchard in the cathedral rafters creates a striking, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details, strongly supporting the tone of cautious bravery, though the oil change timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through imagery and subtext, with effective metaphors like the blossom unfurling, but the central conflict is vague, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining the orchard and cathedral, but some metaphors (e.g., “petals straining like fingertips”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
