<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's sharp-witted nature and linguistic ineptitude are intriguing but underdeveloped; motivations are tied to prophecy but lack depth in personal stakes or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven; the prophecy twist adds intrigue, though connections between actions and outcomes are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thought experiment chamber and bubble bath settings are evocative and enhance the surreal tone; sensory details like burnt ozone and suds are vivid, though some atmospheric elements feel forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in its blend of dance and prophecy, with fresh metaphors, but some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional depth is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering question of denialâ€™s weight, though impact is diluted by uneven execution.</comment>
