<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miro's tiredness and defiance are well-integrated into his motivation to overcome spiritual rust, but his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue, and his reactions feel slightly predictable, missing deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and end tied to Miro's journey, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the cook’s resignation and Miro’s action are tenuous, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is vividly described with sensory details like groaning bridges and drifting incense, enhancing atmosphere, though the setting’s connection to the meteors feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphors (e.g., apathy as armor) evoke thought, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying more on telling than showing Miro’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on familiar tropes of weary warriors and cosmic signs without subversion, and the tone shifts slightly, lacking consistent originality in emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like meteors, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
