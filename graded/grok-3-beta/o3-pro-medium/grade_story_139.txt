<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liao’s stubbornness as a monk drives his quest, but his internal conflict with Mirrorwolf lacks deeper emotional nuance; motivation is clear but reactions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The aerial gondola and mountain setting create a vivid, haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details; tone of cautious enchantment aligns well, though object-setting connection feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (Mirrorwolf, flute) are striking, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions; central conflict is clear but not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others (dragons, ghost colors) verge on cliché; tone is consistent, yet emotional handling lacks subtlety, leaning on explicit description over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive and creatively combined, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; the story leaves a lingering thought, though depth feels constrained by execution.</comment>
