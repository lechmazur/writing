<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lark's foolhardy nature is evident in his risky devotion to intangible forces, but his motivations lack deeper personal stakes or conflict, rendering his development somewhat surface-level despite a distinct detached voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with seasonal changes driving Lark's journey, but the resolution feels overly abstract, and pacing is uneven, with the ending rushed within the word limit, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The snow globe setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like salt cliffs and starlight water, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (glass as barrier, peeling as revelation) create impact, and the theme of silent communication is compelling, but the emotional resonance is muted by detached narration, and the ending lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its snow globe microcosm and wind language concept, with fresh metaphors, but occasionally leans on ornate language that borders on purple prose, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While cohesive and creative in combining elements, the story's abstract style hinders clarity and emotional depth; it leaves a lingering thought but doesn't fully achieve the impact expected of top-tier work.</comment>
