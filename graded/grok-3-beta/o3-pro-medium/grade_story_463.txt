<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the act of confiscating rhythms feels forced and lacks clear cause-effect progression. Pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and unclear arc despite poetic language.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with the haunted lighthouse bedroom vividly rendered through sensory details like moonlight and seawater. Setting enhances mood, though timeframe integration feels slightly contrived.</comment>
