<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape mental confines is clear, but depth and distinct voice are lacking; actions feel symbolic rather than driven by nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details (mirrors, sea gusts, tapping sign), enhancing mood and setting, though connection to character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (mirrors, sparks) add depth, and the ending resonates, but emotional impact is diluted by overwriting and lack of subtle conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor (cradle of sparks, mirrored galaxies), but overly ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but style often hinders clarity with excessive complexity; lingering impact is present but not fully realized.</comment>
