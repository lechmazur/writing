<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marrow's ghostly nature and solemn silliness are intriguing, but his motivation to communicate with animals lacks deeper emotional grounding or complexity, feeling somewhat surface-level despite creative execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of perforation driving a unique climax, but pacing feels uneven—some moments rush while others over-linger on imagery, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen orchard with geothermal streams is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the eerie, chaotic tone and supporting Marrow's ghostly presence; however, some connections to the action feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (straw as conduit, orchard as liminal space) evoke thought and emotion, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the theme of dialogue feels underexplored beyond the surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its surreal approach and fresh metaphors, avoiding overt clichés, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration, but the style sometimes hinders clarity with overcomplex phrasing; it leaves a lingering mood, yet depth feels constrained by the short form's execution.</comment>
