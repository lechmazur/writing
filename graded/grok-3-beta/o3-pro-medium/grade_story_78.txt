<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Iris's late-blooming hero status and softly militant resolve shape her actions, but her motivation lacks depth beyond a vague connection to her brother’s memory; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped due to limited internal conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of coercing knowledge driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolutions and some disjointed transitions between memory and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like ash-laden air, enhancing the tone of reluctant awe and supporting Iris’s motivation; however, the timeframe connection feels slightly abstract and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through imagery and subtext, with strong metaphors like grief bending harvests, but the ending feels only partially satisfying, and the central conflict of loss versus balance lacks sharper resolution within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers some fresh imagery, it leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes without fully subverting them; metaphors are often unique but occasionally over ornate, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the spyglass and cosmic balance, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with dense prose; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so, due to uneven emotional impact.</comment>
