<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's introversion and dancer background are present but underexplored; motivation to escape is clear but lacks depth in emotional stakes or personal history to make it compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between knitting and decoding is intriguing but not fully logical or grounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining knitting with celestial decoding, but metaphors like "echoes of lost civilizations" feel generic; emotional portrayal leans toward stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, lacking profound lingering impact.</comment>
