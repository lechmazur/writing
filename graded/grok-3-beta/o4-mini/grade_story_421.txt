<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to achieve harmony with nature is clear, but the "ferociously polite" attribute feels underexplored and disconnected from actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; the secret mission drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Workshop setting and sensory details like sunbaked petals create immersive atmosphere; tone of anguished joy aligns well with concept, though setting-action connection could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (pressed flowers as pacts) add depth, and the ending is purposeful; however, emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "wildfire in veins" are overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated explicitly, lacking subtext; style feels ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and brevity feels deliberate; however, style occasionally hinders clarity with overly elaborate phrasing; leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
