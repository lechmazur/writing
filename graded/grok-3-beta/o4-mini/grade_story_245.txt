<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's irate nature and motivation to find waterfalls are clear, but the smuggler's personality lacks depth beyond anger and ritual; reactions to the chopstick feel symbolic but not personal enough to reveal nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc from anger to resolution via waterfall discovery is coherent within word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; memorializing action drives the story, though connections between tea leaves and waterfalls are somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport setting enhances desolation and complements the biting tone; sensory details like rusted walls and alien wind are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of regret and hope, with decent use of symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves), but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext; conflict resolution is clear but not profoundly satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of heart's revolt offers some originality, metaphors like "constellations of regret" feel overused; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc without fresh twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinct flair; brief length feels like a constraint, not a choice, though it leaves a lingering sense of hope.</comment>
