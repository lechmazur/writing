<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to expose illusions is clear, but the "frantic cook" feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice or personal depth; the role as a cook seems arbitrary and disconnected from the seismic context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between analyzing notches and broadcasting feels forced and underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the earthquake prediction facility is evocative with strong sensory details like "centuries of layered dust," enhancing atmosphere, but the timeframe's integration feels more poetic than functional, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some intellectual curiosity about deception in science, but emotional impact is limited by telling over showing; imagery like "frenzied tranquility" is intriguing yet overused, diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept of exposing seismic deception is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable conspiracy tropes without subversion; language occasionally feels ornate and repetitive, lacking a distinct authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks depth or lingering impact, making the brevity feel like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
