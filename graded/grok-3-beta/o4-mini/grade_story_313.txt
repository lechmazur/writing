<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reed's portrayal as a con artist is clear, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level remorse and defiance; his interaction with ghosts feels more gimmicky than revealing of character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between interrogating ghosts and Reed’s internal conflict feels forced, disrupting coherence and pacing at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is evocative with sensory details like the rancid stench and groaning windmill, but its integration with the ghostly method and tape dispenser feels inconsistent and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Reed’s remorse, with some effective imagery, but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the ending feels more repetitive than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the ghostly interrogation is a unique angle, the story leans on predictable tropes of haunted remorse without fresh subversion; metaphors like “jaws of defeat” feel overused and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or deeper resonance.</comment>
