<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to "feed curiosity" is clear but lacks depth; the "social media exorcist" concept feels underdeveloped, with actions not fully revealing nuanced personality or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between actions and outcomes are logical yet lack compelling cause-effect depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like "damp concrete" and "bass leaking," enhancing mood, but the setting's connection to character motivation feels tenuous at times.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but metaphors like "midnight pilgrims" feel overused; tone is consistent, yet emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic impressions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, with lingering impact diminished by shallow depth.</comment>
