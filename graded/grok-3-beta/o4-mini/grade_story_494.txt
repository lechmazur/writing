<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman’s personality is somewhat defined by his doubtfully confident swagger and internal conflict, but his motivation feels vague beyond a generic need for reckoning. His reaction to the tapestry fragment reveals little depth, and his voice, while evocative in song, lacks distinctiveness in dialogue or inner thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the authorization driving a resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the master’s decision. Cause and effect are logical, yet the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional thread to feel complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard is vividly described and complements the tone of harsh tenderness, with sensory details like rustling bamboo enhancing mood. However, the setting’s connection to the tapestry fragment feels underdeveloped, and the atmosphere only partially supports the swordsman’s deeper motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the swordsman’s resolve and the glowing runes, with decent use of symbolism in the tapestry. However, the ending feels predictable, lacking a truly satisfying punch, and the central conflict is introduced but resolved too neatly without lingering tension or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like “doubt whispered it might be his prison” feel generic and overused. Emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced subtext, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc without a fresh twist or distinctive style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic to the narrative. The style is clear but unremarkable, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice. It leaves a faint lingering thought of hope, but lacks profound depth.</comment>
