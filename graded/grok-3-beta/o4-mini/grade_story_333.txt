<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's sincerity as a rebel is evident, but her motivation to preserve traditions feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in personal stakes; her actions align, yet her voice and reactions remain somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times; theorizing as an action drives the story logically, though connections between elements occasionally feel forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like damp walls and whispers; however, the tone of bitterness sometimes overshadows other emotional layers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on familiar tropes of hidden passages and ancestral secrets without subversion; emotional nuance is limited, and the style occasionally veers into overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but not distinctive, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
