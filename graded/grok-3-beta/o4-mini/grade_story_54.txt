<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the offload action driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end lacks emotional weight within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; lacks lingering depth.</comment>
