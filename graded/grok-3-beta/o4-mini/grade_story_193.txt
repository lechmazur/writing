<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for the exiled prince is clear with the quest to cure loneliness, but development feels surface-level; reactions to the mortar and pestle lack depth, and the voice is indistinct amidst poetic overtones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the sudden snowstorm encounter feels slightly contrived within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative snowstorm imagery and the desolate customs office enhancing mood; sensory details are vivid, though the connection between setting and object could be more integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with the theme of companionship, but literary devices like metaphors are occasionally overwrought; ending is satisfying, yet subtext and deeper conflict remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar exile and prophecy tropes without subversion; metaphors are sometimes generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward ornate, occasionally hindering clarity; brief length feels somewhat limiting, and lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
