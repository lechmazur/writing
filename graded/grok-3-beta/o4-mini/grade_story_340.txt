<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation to outshine a past failure is clear, but his "endearingly feisty" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistently shown; his personality lacks a distinct voice despite the playful cynicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the youthify action, while central, lacks deeper integration into the resolution of the specter conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Amazonian treehouse city is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, but the connection between setting and the youthify action feels tenuous, and the timeframe's impact is superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Arlo's struggle, but literary devices like imagery are unevenly applied; the ending is satisfying yet lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact beyond surface resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show some originality, the narrative leans on familiar exorcist tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctive flair, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
