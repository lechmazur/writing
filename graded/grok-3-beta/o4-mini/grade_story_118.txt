<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters like the hive-mind therapist and junior agent lack depth; their motivations are vague and reactions to objects like the charger plug feel forced rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there’s a semblance of arc, pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like wax scent and drone hums, but the setting’s connection to character motivation and action feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic wax patterns, but emotional resonance is shallow, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch; subtext is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors and generic descriptors; emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative, and the style often obscures clarity with ornate language, diminishing lasting impact.</comment>
