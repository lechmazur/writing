<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a poignant drive to heal past wounds, but the "trustworthy strange" attribute feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the catapult action driving a symbolic resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed and the cosmic alignment method lacks grounding in the story’s logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and borrowed dawn create a striking, cohesive atmosphere with vivid sensory details like humming turbines and crashing waves, though the setting’s connection to character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism evoke emotional resonance, and the ending feels purposeful, but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the theme of reconciliation feels slightly overstated rather than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
