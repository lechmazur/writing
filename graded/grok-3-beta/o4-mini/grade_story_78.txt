<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the "late-blooming hero" trait feels underexplored, and her "softly militant" nature is stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a sense of arc, the progression feels disjointed within the word limit, with pacing issues and unclear cause-effect links between actions and cosmic goals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative imagery of the post-apocalyptic rooftop farm and bruised sky, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting’s connection to character motivation feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with strong metaphors like "gravity of loss," but emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused post-apocalyptic tropes and generic emotional descriptors; metaphors like "dying stars" feel clichéd, and the tone shifts unnaturally between awe and despair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the style leans toward overwrought prose, diminishing clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
