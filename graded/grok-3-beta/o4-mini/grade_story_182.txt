<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the connection between spoon-churning and mural revelation lacks logical grounding, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like mildew and starlight, but the magnetic mountain and movie house setting feel disconnected from the core action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept, but metaphors like "frolicsome regret" feel overwrought, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with creative elements, but style often obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
