<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's fidgety nature is evident in actions, but motivation feels surface-level; lacks deeper insight into why holding chaos at bay matters personally beyond the immediate task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of lavender field and factory ruins is evocative and complements the tone of fearful joy; sensory details like glowing green shoots are strong, though some descriptions lack variety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering sense of hope, though depth beyond the narrative is limited.</comment>
