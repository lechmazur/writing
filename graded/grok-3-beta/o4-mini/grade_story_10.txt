<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation around forgiveness is clear but lacks depth; the duelist's cheerlessness feels surface-level and underexplored, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the chest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the connection between opening the chest and emotional resolution is tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport is evocative with sensory details like server hums, but the atmosphere only partially supports the bittersweet tone and character motivation, lacking deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional impact through forgiveness theme, but heavy reliance on telling over showing and predictable symbolism (chest as past) diminishes impact; ending feels unsatisfyingly vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing leans on repetitive phrases like "precisely innovative" and generic descriptors; metaphors feel overused (chest as ghosts), and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and style is overly ornate, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
