<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to extinguish self-deception is clear, but the bruised fighter's personality feels underdeveloped beyond physicality and resolve; lacks distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the clay shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect of the ritual through dreams lacks grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere in the dusty attic and marble hall is evocative with strong sensory details like dust rasping on skin; setting enhances mood, though timeframe connection to sculptor’s chisel feels symbolic but vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the fighter’s resolve, with decent use of symbolism (marble illusions); however, ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like “dawn horns echo” feel generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly in the dream sequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels somewhat limiting, and lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
