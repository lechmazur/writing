<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are mostly clear, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the collapsed cathedral turned artistâ€™s haven is vividly realized with strong sensory details, enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone of longing; connection to character motivation is evident but could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a moderate emotional response through imagery and theme of redemption, with effective symbolism in the amber and spider, but the ending feels slightly predictable and lacks a stronger lingering impact.</comment>
