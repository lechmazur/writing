<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation as a lovelorn spy feels underdeveloped; the emotional weight of loss is mentioned but not deeply explored, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the sticky label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the avalanche threat, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of futuristic slums is vividly described with sensory details like neon and toxic debris, enhancing atmosphere, though the tone occasionally overpowers character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a satisfying resolution; dialogue is minimal and functional, not particularly natural or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in imagery, but relies on genre tropes of dystopian spies and avalanches without subversion; metaphors like "icy grip" feel generic, and emotions are often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but feels forced in places; style is evocative yet overly ornate at times, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
