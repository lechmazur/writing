<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's rashness is mentioned but not deeply explored or consistently shown through actions; motivation to protect feels vague and lacks specificity in driving decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; pacing is uneven with rushed transitions, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the wind-swept fortress and howling caverns is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere, though integration with character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (postcards, cosmos) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; ending lacks a strong punch despite thematic intent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in cosmic themes but leans on generic descriptors and predictable mystical tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but style often overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
