<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to decode rock art is clear, but the "ruthless flower arranger" trait feels underexplored in personality depth; actions align with intellectual spontaneity, yet lack a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the comb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; connections between beginning and end are vague, and pacing is uneven with rushed revelations, though the concept of decoding drives the narrative somewhat logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stone circle setting enhances mystery and supports the tone of polite anarchy; sensory details are present but not vivid enough to fully immerse; connection between comb and setting feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intellectual curiosity but lacks emotional depth; imagery and symbolism (petals and glyphs) are intriguing yet repetitive; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying; central conflict is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining botany and archaeology, but metaphors are occasionally generic; tone is consistent but verges on purple prose with overly ornate phrasing; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but not distinctive; brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
