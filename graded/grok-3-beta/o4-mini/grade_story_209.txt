<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The woodsman’s motivation to map abandoned railways is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond surface traits like the "artfully messy" beard. His reaction to the hairbrush feels contrived, and there’s no distinct voice or nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the short-circuit action feels forced and disconnected from a logical cause-effect chain. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts, and coherence suffers from abrupt transitions between memory and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is evocative with rusting sculptures and ivy, enhancing the mood of decay. However, sensory details are inconsistent, and the connection between setting and timeframe (hospital beep) feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with themes of honesty and regret, and some imagery (dust in a dying broadcast) is striking. However, the conflict feels underdeveloped, the ending lacks punch, and emotions are often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping railways via echoes is somewhat original, the execution relies on overused metaphors (heart like a locomotive) and lacks fresh subtext. Emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, and the tone shifts unnaturally at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic. The style is occasionally overwrought, hindering clarity, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice. Lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
