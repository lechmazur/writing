<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the cyber-templar's internal conflict feels stated rather than shown, and their "patiently frantic" nature is inconsistently portrayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and overly reliant on abstract imagery, disrupting coherence; cause and effect are muddled by vague cosmic stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the sky burial site is evocative and ties well to the tone of euphoric agitation, with strong sensory details like carrion cries, though some atmospheric elements feel overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism of light and safety, but emotional impact is diluted by overwrought language; conflict resolution feels more theatrical than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution leans on generic cyberpunk tropes and purple prose, with metaphors like "mirage of safety" feeling repetitive and forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often hinders clarity with excessive ornamentation; it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact.</comment>
