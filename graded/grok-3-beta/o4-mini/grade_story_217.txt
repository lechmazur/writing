<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rion's motivation to awaken wonder is clear, but his personality as an underestimated rebel feels underdeveloped; his actions lack depth in reflecting this trait, and his voice isn't distinct enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional beats; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks strong causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the ephemeral gloom effectively with sensory details like creaking entries and flickering lanterns, but the atmosphere doesn't consistently deepen Rion's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through imagery of shared ramen and ghostly transformation, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the story leans on predictable haunted house tropes without subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the tone shifts slightly unnaturally at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or evidence of profound creative depth.</comment>
