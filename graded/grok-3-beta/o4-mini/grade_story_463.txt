<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is present but inconsistently shapes actions; motivation to learn ghostly negotiation feels underdeveloped and secondary to the dance, lacking depth in personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the dance as resolution, but the action of confiscation is sidelined, and pacing feels rushed at the climax, missing deeper cause-effect connections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom enhances the eerie tone effectively with sensory details like cold drafts and creaking floorboards, though the timeframe integration feels superficial and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with the spectral dance, but subtext on promises is heavy-handed; dialogue is sparse and dry wit feels forced rather than natural, limiting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the ghostly waltz offers some originality, metaphors like "torn promises" are clich√©d; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts unevenly between humor and solemnity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
