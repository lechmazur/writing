<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to hush illusions is clear, but the "fierce ambassador" lacks depth in personality beyond the assigned trait; actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the ghost costume.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the chain of letters driving the narrative, but pacing feels unevenâ€”some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the sunken zeppelin is vividly rendered with sensory details like rusted bulkheads and coral-encrusted steel, enhancing the mood of calm frenzy; setting and timeframe complement the concept of shared dreams effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through symbolism of the ghost costume and shared dreams, with some subtext about illusion and truth; however, emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing, and the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the surreal combination of elements, but metaphors like "cathedral of coral-encrusted steel" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance lacks nuance, often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about truth and illusion; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
