<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aurora's vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are clear motivators, but her personality lacks depth beyond scorn and determination; reactions to objects like the locket feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the counterattack and quest for the hidden continent, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and some connections, like the photographs, lack clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forgotten market and rebellion timeframe create a vivid backdrop, with sensory details like dusty stalls enhancing mood, but the atmosphere occasionally feels secondary to plot demands rather than fully immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Aurora's quest, but literary devices like symbolism of the locket are underdeveloped; the ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of rebellion and hidden lands without subversion; sensory details are generic at times, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering sense of purpose, though creative integration feels constrained by the brief length.</comment>
