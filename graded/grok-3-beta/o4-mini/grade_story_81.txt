4. <question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes some thought on time and empathy through symbolism, but lacks emotional resonance; ending feels poetic yet unsatisfying, missing a clear central conflict.</comment>
5. <question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While imagery is occasionally fresh, the narrative leans on repetitive phrases like “time-dilated” and overly ornate language, diminishing originality and suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
6. <question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story shows creative integration of elements, but cohesion suffers from overcomplex style; it leaves a lingering thought on time, yet feels more like an exercise than a deliberate short piece.</comment>
