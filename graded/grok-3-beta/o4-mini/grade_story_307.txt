<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The spirited guardian's quietly rebellious nature is evident, but their motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory, making their actions feel more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with some rushed transitions; the connection between shaping light and the broader rebellion is logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fairy light repair shop and the post-parade hush create a haunting, evocative atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like flickering neon and fogged windows; however, the setting's connection to the character's deeper motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through its imagery of hope and rebellion, with effective use of metaphor and symbolism, but the lack of a concrete central conflict and overreliance on abstract themes diminishes overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on light as rebellion, it leans on somewhat generic descriptors and occasionally flowery language, risking purple prose; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but the overly poetic style sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling of hope, though not a deeply provocative thought.</comment>
