<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve rituals is clear, but the "steady gravedigger" lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel generic and not uniquely tied to personality or background.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed moments; cause and effect are vague, and the action of kindrelizing lacks clear impact on resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the reimagined Aztec temple is evocative with strong sensory details like crumbling walls and lantern glow; atmosphere supports tone, though connection to character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (obsidian mirror, worlds overlapping) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying; lacks strong central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on overused metaphors (veil thinning, voices from beyond) and generic descriptors; tone shifts slightly, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with assigned elements, but style is occasionally overwrought, hindering clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; lacks lingering depth or resonance.</comment>
