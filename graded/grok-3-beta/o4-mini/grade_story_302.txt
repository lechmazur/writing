<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the taming of chaos driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between incantations and ship reactions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steampunk airship dining room is vividly realized with sensory details like hissing pipes and clinking silverware, enhancing the chaotic atmosphere, though the timeframe of poetry readings feels underutilized in mood-building.</comment>
