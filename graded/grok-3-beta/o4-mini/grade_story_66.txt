<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to break the cycle of violence is clear, but the "quiet deserter" lacks a distinct voice or deeper personal history to ground their actions; their personality feels more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists with a sense of resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between plant studies and personal transformation are intriguing yet underdeveloped, causing minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of a plant communication study is unique and supports the theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere often feels detached from the emotional weight of the characterâ€™s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with mirrors and masks, and the theme of transformation is evident, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining plant signals with personal redemption, but metaphors like "cracked mirror" and "shattered masks" feel overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward overwriting, hindering clarity; it shows creative intent, yet lacks the polish and depth for a lasting impression.</comment>
