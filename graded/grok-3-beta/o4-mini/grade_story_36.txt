<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the skateboard's role in triggering the mechanism feels contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop and sunrise timeframe create a vivid atmosphere; sensory details like steam hisses and train whistles enhance immersion, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
