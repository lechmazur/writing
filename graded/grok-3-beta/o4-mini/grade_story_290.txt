<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to shift cosmic power is clear, but the shapeshifter's personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "intelligently foolish" trait, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed in the final confrontation, and some cause-effect links, like the taxi's sudden descent, are abrupt and unexplained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on generic descriptors and predictable rebellion tropes without subversion; tone shifts slightly with overly ornate language at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally hinders clarity with dense prose; it leaves a lingering idea of revolt, though depth is constrained by brevity.</comment>
