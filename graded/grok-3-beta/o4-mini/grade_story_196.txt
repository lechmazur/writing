<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in setting and concept, but metaphors like “spark of defiance” feel generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuanced subtext, leaning on explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but style often feels overwrought, and the brief length exposes underdeveloped ideas rather than showcasing deliberate brevity.</comment>
