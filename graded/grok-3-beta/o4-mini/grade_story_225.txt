<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to track migratory butterflies is clear and drives the apothecary's actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond her resolve; the "unjustly fair" attribute feels underexplored in shaping her voice or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit; the connection between butterfly tracking and wartime context is intriguing yet not fully coherent or logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like rain-slick portholes and hissing steam, enhancing the atmosphere; tone of battered marvel complements the unconventional love, though some setting elements feel decorative rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the subtle romance and butterfly imagery, with effective symbolism of glowing spores; however, the central conflict feels understated, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining steampunk and naturalist themes, but some metaphors (e.g., "clandestine kisses") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like butterflies and Morse code, leaving a lingering sense of hope; however, style occasionally veers into ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
