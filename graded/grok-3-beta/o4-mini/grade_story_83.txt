<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to sow seeds of a better tomorrow feels vague and disconnected from the cryptid research focus; the suspiciously trusting trait is mentioned but not deeply explored in actions or consequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the connection between tracing burn patterns and the resolution feels forced and lacks logical progression, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative imagery of broken mirrors and abandoned labs, enhancing the tone of mystery, though sensory details are uneven and sometimes overly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic mirrors and renewal themes, but emotional resonance is shallow due to reliance on telling over showing; ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors (mirrors as illusion) and generic descriptors; writing feels ornate with purple prose, lacking nuanced emotion and showing signs of formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite creative elements; style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and the story feels constrained by length rather than deliberately concise; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
