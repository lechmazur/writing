<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's trait of seeing ghosts is intriguing and shapes his actions, but his motivations feel vague and inconsistently tied to his clumsiness or profession. His reactions to the flower crown reveal some depth, though his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the action of dissecting ghosts feels repetitive and doesn't drive a clear resolution. Pacing is uneven, with rushed spectral encounters and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is unique and complements the ghostly tone, but sensory details are sparse and inconsistently evocative. The atmosphere supports the concept of silence, though not powerfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild fascination with ghosts and silence, but lacks emotional depth or a satisfying ending. Imagery and symbolism (flower crown) are present but underdeveloped; conflict is vague and resolution weak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality, the execution relies on ghostly tropes without subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story feels somewhat cohesive with its elements, but they often overshadow the narrative. Style is clear but uninspired; the length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the impact is fleeting without lingering depth.</comment>
