<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The burnt-out general's weariness and internal conflict are evident, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a generic desire for renewal; his interaction with the seaweed feels symbolic but underdeveloped in revealing personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the general's reflection and the resolution via photographs feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Dark Matter Diner setting is evocative and ties well to the cosmic, surreal tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the general's motivation, lacking immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with shared anxieties and fear, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; imagery is present but not striking enough to linger, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a cosmic diner is intriguing, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of weary soldiers and collective resolve without fresh subversion; metaphors like "dethroning fear" feel overused and lack originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style often overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a faint impression of unity but lacks the depth for a lasting impact.</comment>
