<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; the hushed necromancer's personality and motivation are vaguely tied to mapping caves but feel underdeveloped. The shared love for old movies is a quirky trait but doesn't meaningfully shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with mapping as the goal, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed moments of action and overextended descriptive pauses. Cause and effect are muddled during the tremor resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone, but the connection to character motivation and timeframe ("between sets") feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance or subtext; imagery is present but often generic. The ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful, and the central conflict of cave instability is resolved too easily without tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clich√©d metaphors and predictable narrative patterns. Emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts inconsistently between mystical and nostalgic without nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than integral. The style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the story lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
