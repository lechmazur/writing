<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with the action of dividing burdens underdeveloped; pacing is uneven, rushing through key emotional beats while lingering on less impactful details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned space station medical bay is evocative with sensory details like antiseptic smells, but the connection to the dried flowers feels forced and the atmosphere only partially supports the redemption theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through imagery of fragility, but overreliance on telling rather than showing emotions and a lack of sharp conflict diminish impact; ending feels more hopeful than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "universe hums its secret song" feel generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward ornate language that obscures clarity; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking deeper lingering impact.</comment>
