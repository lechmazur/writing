<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the disintegration action driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed and connections between elements are often vague or forced, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the variable star observation deck is evocative and ties to the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and the tone of confusing certainty isnâ€™t consistently supported by the world-building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on overused metaphors (rust as decay) and lacks nuanced emotion; style feels ornate and occasionally formulaic, detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from unclear motivations and overly complex language; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
