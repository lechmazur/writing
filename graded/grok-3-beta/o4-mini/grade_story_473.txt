<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaric's eccentricity and leadership burdens are evident, but his motivations feel abstract and lack depth; his actions align with unpredictability, yet his inner conflict lacks specificity to create a distinct voice or emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with pruning and fate-manipulation driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are often vague or overly symbolic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panels create a striking, unique setting with sensory details like electric hums, but the atmosphere only partially supports the character's motivation, and the tone's bittersweetness feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism of pruning and fate, but emotional impact is muted by overreliance on telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch or lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of pruning destiny is original, the execution leans on generic metaphors and lacks nuanced emotion; the style feels ornate at times, with some descriptors feeling formulaic rather than vivid or personal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often obscures clarity with overly complex imagery; it shows creative intent, yet fails to leave a lingering, profound impact or question for the reader.</comment>
