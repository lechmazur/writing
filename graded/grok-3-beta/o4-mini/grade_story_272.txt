<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reaping regret driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed and some connections between elements are vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of forgotten arts offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of rediscovery and lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the whistle, but the style occasionally obscures clarity and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
