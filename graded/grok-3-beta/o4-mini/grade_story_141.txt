<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the underwater exploration driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with vivid sensory details of the underwater cave system enhancing the tone of curious dread; setting and timeframe mesh well, though object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue is minimal and lacks impact; central conflict is present but not sharply defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, with fresh imagery, but reliance on mystical tropes and generic descriptors like "ancestral memory" dulls uniqueness; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
