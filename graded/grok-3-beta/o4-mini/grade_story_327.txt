<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to honor a teacher’s legacy is clear, but the restless conjurer’s personality lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than nuanced traits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like “fractured glass” feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward ornate, hindering clarity; brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength, with limited lingering impact.</comment>
