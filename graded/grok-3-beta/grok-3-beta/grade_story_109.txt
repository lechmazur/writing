<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aldric’s cold nature and rebellious streak are evident, but his sudden shift to warmth via the mitten feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation; actions align with traits but lack a distinct voice or nuanced progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of support feels forced into the narrative; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts, and coherence suffers from abrupt transitions between espionage and personal awakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret agent center and late-night hush create an intriguing backdrop, and sensory details like fogged breath add mood, but the setting’s connection to the mitten and altars feels tenuous; atmosphere supports tone but lacks immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with the mitten as a symbol, and some imagery (frost melting) works, but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully earned, lacking deeper subtext or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a knight in a spy center is unique, the execution relies on predictable emotional tropes (cold heart thawing) without subversion; metaphors are somewhat generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, risking formulaic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a faint impression but lacks profound depth.</comment>
