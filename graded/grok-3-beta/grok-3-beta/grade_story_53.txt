<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s rash protector nature is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions; her impulsiveness softens too quickly into introspection without sufficient grounding in prior behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between moving day and the fortress detour feels slightly forced; pacing is uneven with overly reflective passages slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and howling caverns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the setting occasionally overshadows character action, reducing its integration with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative mood with effective imagery and symbolism (postcards as constellations), but the emotional impact is diluted by repetitive introspection; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of emotional residue in objects is unique, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of self-discovery without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often verge on purple prose, lacking precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for a top-tier publication.</comment>
