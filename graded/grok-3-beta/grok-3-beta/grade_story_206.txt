<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maris’s vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are clear, but her deeper personality and voice feel underdeveloped; motivation is consistent but lacks nuanced emotional depth beyond scorn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the counterattack driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between the locket and the continent is underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is vividly described and enhances the mood of decay and secrecy; sensory details are strong, though the rebellion timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (candy as curses) are effective, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level grief; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying, lacking a stronger thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of candy sculptures as coded messages is original, but some metaphors (heart as furnace) are clichéd; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length exposes gaps in depth; it leaves a lingering idea of revenge as a compass, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
