<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liang’s calm demeanor as an assassin is well-portrayed, but his motivation for freedom feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct personal voice or nuanced reaction to the prophecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of amalgamating the prophecy driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is evocative and complements the tone of intrigue, with sensory details like silk screens and peonies enhancing atmosphere, though deeper integration with the botanical press is lacking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has some emotional resonance and uses symbolism (butterfly wings, prophecy as flower), but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks intensity; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like “butterfly’s wing of change” feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly unique stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the botanical press, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
