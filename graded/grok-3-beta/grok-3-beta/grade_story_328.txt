<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cal's assertively meek demeanor is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to escape is clear, but his personality lacks depth or distinct voice to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between technology and escape lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mirage oasis setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of desperate optimism, with strong sensory imagery, though the timeframe of the firework feels underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Cal’s struggle, with decent use of symbolism (mirage as false hope), but the ending lacks punch, and the conflict feels surface-level without deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, metaphors like “labyrinth of dunes” feel overused, and emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
