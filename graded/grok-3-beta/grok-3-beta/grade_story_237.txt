<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a poignant backstory of heartbreak, but the "proudly humble" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in action beyond stated intent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the action of "lengthening" understanding is intriguing but lacks clear causal progression to resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining psychic genealogy with space piracy, but metaphors like "struck like a comet" are generic, and emotional depth lacks nuanced subtext, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
