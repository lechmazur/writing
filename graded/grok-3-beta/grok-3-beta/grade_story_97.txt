<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thalia’s fact-minded nature is well-established and drives her initial detachment, but her shift to empathy feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual transformation for a character so rooted in logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from cold logic to emotional awakening is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the emotional pivot, with insufficient buildup to the heartbreak-induced visions disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly rendered with evocative imagery, enhancing the story’s surreal tone, though sensory details are unevenly distributed, with some areas feeling abstract rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Thalia’s transformation and uses strong symbolism with the compass, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of empathy over logic lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of an oracle learning empathy is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., “shard of glass in sterile thoughts”) feel overused, and the emotional shift lacks nuanced showing, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
