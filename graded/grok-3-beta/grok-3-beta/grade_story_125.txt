<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Tobinâ€™s underachieving nature and desire to reclaim his heritage are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond generic frustration and ambition; reactions to the doll head feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the unveiling of secrets driving momentum, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between misdelivered packages and heritage are logical yet underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned space station setting is evocative with some sensory detail, enhancing the eerie tone, but the farmland boundary feels tacked on; atmosphere supports bored excitement, though sensory immersion is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and some thematic depth around heritage, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering resonance or standout craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the concept of misdelivered packages offers a slight twist, the narrative leans on familiar mage-heritage tropes without subversion; language is clear but lacks a distinct style, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels constrained by its length rather than deliberately concise; it shows creative intent but lacks a profound lingering thought or polished execution.</comment>
