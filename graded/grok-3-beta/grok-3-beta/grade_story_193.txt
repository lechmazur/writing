<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlen’s motivation to cure loneliness is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the exiled prince trope; his actions with the mortar and pestle feel more symbolic than revealing of nuanced character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the snowstorm-driven encounter drives the story logically, though cause-effect links are somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a strong, evocative atmosphere of isolation that supports the theme of loneliness; sensory details like the scent of forgotten summers are effective, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through shared loneliness, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable uniqueness; the ending is satisfying yet predictable, and literary devices like symbolism are present but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on familiar tropes of exiled royalty and magical relics without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks a lingering impact or truly creative integration; the style is clear but not distinctive, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
