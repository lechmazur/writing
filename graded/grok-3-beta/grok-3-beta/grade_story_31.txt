<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elias’s solemnity and past as an overlooked child are stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or dialogue, making motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the action of x-ing out names lacks sufficient buildup or emotional weight.</comment>
