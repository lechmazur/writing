<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Riven’s motivation to “kiss the horizon of madness” is intriguing but underdeveloped; his fiercely nonchalant demeanor feels inconsistent with his intense obsession, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between reciting poetry and taming chaos feels forced; pacing is uneven, with the climax rushed and lacking clear cause-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk airship dining room is vividly described with sensory details like brass gears and gas lamps, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting’s connection to taming chaos feels superficial and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes mild tension through Riven’s reckless act, and imagery like “chaos peering through portholes” is striking, but the emotional impact is shallow, with little subtext or lasting resonance beyond the surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of taming chaos via poetry is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable tropes of the mad artist; metaphors like “storms as lovers” feel overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a fleeting vignette.</comment>
