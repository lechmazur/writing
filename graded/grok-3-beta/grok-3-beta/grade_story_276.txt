<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Kael's unease and diplomatic struggles, but his personality lacks depth beyond generic anxiety; reactions to the coathanger feel symbolic but forced, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven with rushed introspection, and the connection between debris tracking and diplomacy lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the orbital station is evocative with sensory details like alarms and rustling postcards, but the atmosphere only partially supports the redemption theme, feeling disconnected at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through isolation and hope, with decent use of symbolism (tree, coathanger), but lacks memorable uniqueness and deeper subtext; ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "branches of redemption" are overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
