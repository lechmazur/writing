<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and emotional resolution, but the pacing feels uneven, with too much focus on internal reflection over action, disrupting narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like bioluminescent orchids and synthetic air, enhancing the tone of intimate separation, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes longing and hope through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying emotional ending, but it occasionally over-relies on telling emotions rather than showing, diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the setting and concept are imaginative, the emotional narrative leans on familiar tropes of lost love and isolation without significant subversion; some metaphors feel ornate rather than fresh, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
