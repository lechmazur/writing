<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Selene’s motivation to create a legacy of compassion is clear, but her "aimlessly passionate" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes her decisions beyond surface impulsiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the paper airplane’s flight providing a clear trigger, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between fallen leaves as a method and the resolution is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subterranean colosseum under an amusement park is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone, with moonlight and torchlight adding atmosphere, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional tension through Selene’s hesitation, and the bent fork as a symbol of resilience is a nice touch, but the ending lacks a strong punch, and the theme of compassion feels stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
