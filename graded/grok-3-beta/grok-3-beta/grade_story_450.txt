<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's sharp wit and dancer identity are present but underdeveloped; her linguistic ineptitude feels like a convenient barrier rather than a deeply explored trait. Motivation to unravel the prophecy is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the family photo tradition as a central action feels forced and doesn't fully drive the narrative. Pacing is uneven, with overemphasis on introspection slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The thought experiment chamber is intriguing and ties to the reflective tone, but sensory details are sparse beyond mirrors and bubbles. Atmosphere supports ambivalence, though the bubble bath timeframe feels oddly mundane against the futuristic setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on denial and tradition, with decent use of symbolism (spaceship patch), but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. The ending hints at rebellion but lacks a punchy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a dancer expressing through movement is fresh, the narrative leans on repetitive phrases like "weight of denial" and generic reflections. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic. Style is clear but lacks distinct flair, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate. Lingering questions are present but not compelling.</comment>
