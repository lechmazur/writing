<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters Elias and Maris have clear motivations—Elias’s pursuit of butterflies and Maris’s guarded heart—but their development feels surface-level, lacking deeper nuance or distinct voice within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the butterfly-tracking motivation, while unique, doesn’t fully drive narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like “brass gears” and “steam-hissed air,” enhancing the battered marvel tone, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through coded longing and has symbolic depth with butterflies as metaphors for unseen paths, but the ending lacks a stronger punch, and dialogue is minimal and functional rather than striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the Morse code method and steampunk setting offer originality, the love story leans on familiar tropes of stoic and yearning archetypes without subversion, and some descriptors like “unjustly fair” feel forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like Morse code, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound takeaway.</comment>
