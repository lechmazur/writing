<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Percival's submissive nature and perceptive attribute are present, but his transition to decisive action feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his meek demeanor; motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of liquifying a sedative driving the story forward logically, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and coherence is occasionally strained by abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret agent workshop and yard work timeframe are integrated well, with sensory details like muffled sounds enhancing atmosphere, but the setting's potential to deepen the mood or action is underutilized.</comment>
