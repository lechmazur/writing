<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of globalizing feels abrupt and unrealistic at the end; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like “past as a cage” are clichéd; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style is occasionally overwrought; brevity feels like a limitation, not a choice, with lingering impact muted by rushed conclusion.</comment>
