<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Elias’s late-blooming heroism and softly militant nature are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation is clear but lacks depth beyond surface grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the rift discovery feels abrupt, and pacing is rushed toward the end, undermining resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm is vividly rendered and supports the tone of reluctant awe, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with imagery like “skeletal skyscrapers,” but emotional resonance is shallow due to telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion; metaphors like “graveyard of ash” feel generic, and emotional handling lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the style prioritizes ornate language over clarity, limiting impact.</comment>
