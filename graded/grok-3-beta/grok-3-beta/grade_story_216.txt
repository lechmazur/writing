<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dorian's role as a scapegoat is intriguing and shapes his internal conflict, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from blame-absorber to identity-seeker lacks depth in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the search for the washer driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between midnight calls and final revelation is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cloud City is vividly imagined with strong atmospheric potential, enhancing the tone of mystery, though sensory details are sparse and the setting's connection to the washer feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about identity and duty, with decent use of symbolism (washer as self), but the ending lacks emotional punch, and the writing occasionally tells rather than shows emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a scapegoat in a futuristic city is fresh, some metaphors (storm cloud, forgotten name) are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the washer and Cloud City, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the impact is muted by underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
