<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Torren’s shaky nature and mercenary background are evident, but his motivation to make peace with the past feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance; actions align with traits, yet his voice and inner conflict remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of finalizing a quest driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; connections between beginning and end are present, though some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting and echoing hour timeframe blend effectively, creating a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of improbable longing; sensory details like hissing spray cans and crunching glass are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Torren’s guilt, with decent use of symbolism (amber spider), but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext; conflict is present but resolved too neatly, missing layers of complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like “ghosts only he could see” feel overused; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly unique style or surprising twist, leaning on familiar redemption tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but unremarkable, and while the brevity suits the piece, it lacks a lingering depth or question to leave with the reader.</comment>
