<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to find connection is clear, but his personality as an eager lookout feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice; his actions align with the motivation but reveal little depth beyond surface-level yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the cleaning action driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between spectral clues and resolution is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman villa setting is vividly described with sensory details like moss and holograms, enhancing the atmosphere of history and modernity, though the tone of ruthless kindness occasionally clashes with the ghostly mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's quest for connection, with some effective symbolism in the sewing box, but the theme of faithâ€™s wager feels underexplored, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the blend of ancient and digital is somewhat original, the ghostly seamstress trope feels predictable without subversion, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing; metaphors are occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic to the narrative; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface plot.</comment>
