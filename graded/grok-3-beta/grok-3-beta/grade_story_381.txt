<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map the caves for preserving humanity's story is clear, but Veyra's personality feels underdeveloped beyond her resolve and nostalgia; her "hushed" nature lacks distinct impact on her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of dominating the cave is present but lacks a definitive resolution or escalation, leaving the narrative somewhat static despite coherent cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described and enhances the futuristic nostalgia, with strong sensory details like refracted light, but its connection to the baseball cap feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through nostalgia and resolve, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending; conflict is present but underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of bonding over old movies is original, the execution relies on predictable nostalgic tropes without subversion; metaphors like "celluloid dreams" feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like movies and spirits, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
