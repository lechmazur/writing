<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Riley’s sincerity as a rebel is evident, but their motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth; the reaction to the sticky note is symbolic but not revelatory of deeper character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overly dense introspection; the action of theorizing drives the story minimally, and coherence suffers from repetitive focus on fear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted passage and timeframe of "between storms" create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like damp fog; however, the setting’s connection to the object feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Riley’s resolve, with some effective imagery (braided bitterness), but lacks subtext or a truly satisfying ending; conflict is present but not sharply defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable ghostly tropes without subversion; metaphors like “bitter braid” are overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but not distinctive, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
