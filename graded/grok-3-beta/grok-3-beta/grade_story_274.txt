<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of outrunning inertia driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in and desolate neighborhood create a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone of scalding ambivalence, with strong sensory details of decay, though some descriptions border on repetitive.</comment>
