<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Torvald’s hesitance and awkwardness are portrayed consistently, shaping his actions and internal conflict, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance beyond surface-level doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the action of emerging lacks a stronger causal impact on the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere and mirroring Torvald’s inner conflict; however, the connection between setting and object feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Torvald’s transformation, with effective symbolism in the hermit crabs, but the ending feels predictable, and the writing occasionally leans on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of bridging worlds offers some originality, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of duty and ancestral pacts without subversion, and some metaphors, like the shell-swapping, feel slightly overused rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
