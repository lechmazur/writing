<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jace’s portrayal as a con artist with an unusually normal demeanor is intriguing, but his motivations shift unevenly between cynicism and remorse without sufficient depth or backstory to ground the transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of comforting a ghost feels abrupt and underdeveloped, lacking a stronger causal link to Jace’s broader schemes or past failures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly described with a fitting tone of decay, enhancing the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between the setting and the tape dispenser feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Jace’s interaction with the ghost, and the tape dispenser as a symbol of failure-turned-triumph is clever, but the ending lacks a deeper punch, and the theme of redemption feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of interrogating ghosts is somewhat original, the story leans on familiar dystopian and ghostly tropes without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the integration feels forced at times, particularly with the tape dispenser; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a strength.</comment>
