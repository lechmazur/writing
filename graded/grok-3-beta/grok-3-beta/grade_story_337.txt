<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mei’s motivation to restore traditional practices is clear, and her "reliably unreliable" trait shapes her cryptic fortunes, but her personality lacks depth beyond whimsy, and her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the oracle’s advice and Mei’s action feels tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed transitions in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope studio and predawn timeframe create a vivid atmosphere that supports the whimsical tone, but sensory details are inconsistently applied, and the setting’s connection to the chipped tile feels symbolic yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity with its theme of imperfection, and imagery like “fractured light” is effective, but the emotional impact is shallow, and the ending lacks a strong punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a fortune writer in a kaleidoscope studio is unique, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion, and metaphors like “shattered glass” eyes feel overused and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
