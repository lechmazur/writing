<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s cosmic powers and factory worker background are intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the conflict between mundane life and cosmic potential lacks depth in her internal struggle, making her actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ritual of reviewing life choices drives the plot, but the arc feels slightly rushed within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a stronger emotional resolution to fully satisfy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking, atmospheric setting that enhances the ritual’s weight; sensory details like stone eyes glinting are evocative, though more varied sensory immersion could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of rebellion and release, with decent use of symbolism (abyss as doubt), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced showing over telling; the ending feels purposeful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the cosmic powers and ritual offer originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of breaking free without subversion; metaphors like “cosmos in her veins” feel slightly overused, and emotional depth lacks human nuance at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but they sometimes overshadow a deeper narrative; the style is clear but not distinctive, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
