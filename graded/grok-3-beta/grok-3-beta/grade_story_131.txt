<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness as an orphan shapes his solitary nature, but his motivation to transform fear into courage feels underdeveloped and slightly inconsistent with his detachment; reactions to the stones reveal some depth, though his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The garage cleaning action drives the plot minimally, with a clear arc from isolation to resilience, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the concept of adaptation shapes the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized and enhances the mood of unpredictability, with sensory details like clinking stones adding immersion; however, the connection between setting and objects could be more integral to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eli's quiet transformation, with symbolism of floating stones effective but not striking; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying, and subtext is present but lacks complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in combining the anomaly with personal growth, avoiding overt clich√©s, but sensory details are occasionally generic; emotional handling is nuanced at times but often stated rather than shown, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but not remarkable, and while it leaves a lingering thought, the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
