<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation to seek forbidden knowledge is clear, but her "enthusiastic apathy" feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance; her actions align with curiosity but her distinct voice is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by hacking archives, but pacing feels uneven with rushed exposition and a lingering, unresolved ending that lacks punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caravan repair station and post-flood timeframe create a vivid, desolate atmosphere with strong sensory details like salt and rust; the setting enhances Maris's isolation, though the lavender's connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (lavender as talisman, galaxy in chest) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a stronger lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on predictable post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, often stating feelings, and prose occasionally veers into overwrought territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style sometimes obscures clarity with ornate language; it shows creative intent but lacks the depth to leave a lasting impression beyond the narrative.</comment>
