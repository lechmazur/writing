<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thalia’s empathic nature and no-nonsense demeanor are clear, but her blacksmith identity feels underexplored beyond the forging act; motivation is consistent but lacks depth in revealing personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between action and concept could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is vividly rendered with sensory details and enhances the mood of grief and preservation; however, the timeframe’s integration feels slightly vague and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism effectively with the heart-shaped ornament, but the ending feels predictable, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a blacksmith in a dollhouse museum is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “humanity’s heart still beats”) feel overused, and emotional descriptions occasionally lack subtlety, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
