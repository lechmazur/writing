<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rorik’s closed-off nature as a reaver is evident, and his motivation to break generational patterns is clear, but his internal conflict lacks deeper nuance; the reaction to the drawing feels somewhat surface-level despite its emotional potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the drawing and poems driving introspection, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end could be more impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope Park is vividly described with prismatic imagery that mirrors Rorik’s fractured soul, enhancing the atmosphere; however, sensory details beyond sight are underutilized, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Rorik’s longing and self-loathing, with strong symbolism in the drawing and park, but the ending feels slightly unresolved, and the theme of breaking cycles lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and perspective, some metaphors (e.g., “taste the stars”) feel slightly overused, and emotional expression occasionally leans toward stating rather than showing, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the park and drawing, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
