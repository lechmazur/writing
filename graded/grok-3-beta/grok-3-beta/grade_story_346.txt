<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Torvald's boastful nature is well-established and drives his internal conflict, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper nuance in motivation beyond surface-level shame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the shift from bravado to clarity is rushed, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The giant wasp's nest is vividly described with sensory details like humming and balloon pops, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and mirroring Torvald's mental chaos, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on truth versus illusion and uses symbolism effectively (lint as ego debris), but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a warrior in a wasp's nest is unique, the narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion, and some metaphors (e.g., "fabricated tapestry") feel overused and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the nest and soliloquies, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
