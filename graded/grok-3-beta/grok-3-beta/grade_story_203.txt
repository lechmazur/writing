<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Father Elias’s stage fright is well-integrated into his role as an exorcist, shaping his internal conflict, but his motivation feels slightly repetitive and lacks deeper nuance beyond overcoming fear. His voice, while distinct in intent, isn’t fully fleshed out through unique dialogue or perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the exorcism driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger on introspection while the resolution feels rushed. Cause and effect are logical, though coherence is occasionally disrupted by dense symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, complementing the defiant hush tone. Sensory details like the metallic echo are evocative, though some connections between setting and object (wildflowers) feel strained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Elias’s struggle, with strong use of symbolism (wildflowers, debris). However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of overcoming lies, while present, lacks a truly surprising or layered subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “broken dreams orbiting”) feel familiar and slightly overused. Emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced reaction. The style is distinct but occasionally veers into ornate language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate. However, the style sometimes obscures clarity with dense imagery, and the lingering impact, while present, isn’t as profound as top-tier work demands.</comment>
