<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's earnestness is evident, but his motivation feels somewhat generic and lacks depth; his connection to the map is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with mapping tears as a novel action, but the connection between this act and the ultimate goal feels tenuous and slightly forced, disrupting full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arid desert and ruined aqueduct create a vivid backdrop that enhances the tone of nostalgia and desolation; sensory details like the merciless sun and silence are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of hope and ruin, with decent imagery, but the symbolism of tears and stars feels heavy-handed, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping tears is original, the narrative leans on familiar knightly quest tropes without subversion; metaphors like "canvas of life" are overused, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
