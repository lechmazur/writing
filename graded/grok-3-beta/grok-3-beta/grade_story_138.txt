<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elric's motivation to uncover his past is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond "hollow recklessness"; his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue, and reactions to the drone and ticket stubs reveal little new depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the action of fortifying resolve ties logically to the method, though coherence suffers from abrupt shifts in focus between drone and stubs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The spontaneous combustion lab is vividly described with sensory detail (ash, scorched metal), enhancing the chaotic atmosphere and mirroring Elric’s inner turmoil; however, the timeframe of text messages feels underutilized in shaping the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with the mystery of Elric’s past, and imagery (drone as accusatory eyes) is effective, but the ending lacks punch; dialogue is minimal and merely functional, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a forgotten noble and drone is somewhat fresh, metaphors like "hollow echo" feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts slightly with overly ornate phrasing at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but not striking, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
