<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of surpassing driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between chimes and discoveries are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The puppet master’s workshop and twilight timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like dust and clinking chimes; however, the playground swing feels underutilized in the setting’s impact.</comment>
