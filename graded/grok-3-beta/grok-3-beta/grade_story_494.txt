<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's arrogance and doubtfully confident nature are well-portrayed, shaping his initial dismissive attitude, but his transformation feels slightly rushed, lacking deeper internal conflict to fully ground his motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven; the song as a method to break the curse is intriguing yet underexplored, making the resolution somewhat abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard is vividly described and complements the tone of harsh tenderness; sensory details like twilight skies and scuffing boots enhance immersion, though the setting's connection to the tapestry feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Kael's rebirth, with strong imagery and symbolism in the tapestry, but the dialogue is minimal and the theme of igniting hope, while present, lacks deeper subtext to truly resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique take on shackled potential, some metaphors (e.g., "blade wrapped in silk") feel overused, and emotional depth is stated more than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the song and tapestry, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
