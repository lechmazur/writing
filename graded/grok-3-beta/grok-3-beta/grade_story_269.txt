<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s nostalgia as a tailor is evident, but his motivation to ascend feels underdeveloped and somewhat disconnected from his profession; the mirror interaction reveals longing, yet his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; confessions during the storm drive the story but lack deeper consequence, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck is vividly described with sensory details like steam vents and rain, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting’s connection to parallel lives feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes mild longing through Elias’s confessions, with some effective mirror symbolism, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of feelings; the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel lives offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of longing and alternate selves without subversion; metaphors like the mirror are predictable, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks depth, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
