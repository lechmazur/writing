<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lian's chameleon nature is intriguing and shapes his actions, but his motivation to weave emotional honesty feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution, making his reactions somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with solving mysteries driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between clues and conclusions are not fully convincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is vividly reimagined, and sunlight through debris enhances the mood, but sensory details are uneven, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through smell or sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Lian’s discoveries, and imagery like sunlight beams is effective, but the ending feels slightly forced, and subtext is present but not fully layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a chameleon actor solving mysteries is original, some metaphors (e.g., “fractured beams of hope”) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies too much on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the doll’s dress, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
