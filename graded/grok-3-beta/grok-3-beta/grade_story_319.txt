<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tobin’s frailty and wavering resolve are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the motivation to escape; actions align with motivation, yet his voice feels indistinct and generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with carving messages driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; logical flow is maintained, though the resolution lacks impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal island setting is vividly described with sensory details like salty wind and weeping shores, enhancing the melancholic tone and Tobin’s isolation; however, the connection to the phial feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Tobin’s struggle, with some effective imagery (island mourning), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable ending; conflict is present but resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of escape and forbidden relics without subversion; metaphors are somewhat generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but lacks a lingering impact or truly innovative style; the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
