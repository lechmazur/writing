<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Harrow’s duty, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels functional rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, some metaphors feel generic, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing; the narrative avoids major clichés but lacks a fully distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a faint lingering thought.</comment>
