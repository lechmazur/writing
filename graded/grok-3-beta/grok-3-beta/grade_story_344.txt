<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maris’s claustrophobia and role as an underwater explorer are well-integrated into her motivation to study human behavior, but her emotional depth feels surface-level; her reactions lack nuanced complexity beyond stated fear and memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from fear to resolve is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional shifts; the jam-tasting method drives the story but lacks deeper causal logic to fully anchor the transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly surreal and enhances the atmosphere of improbable healing; sensory details like moss-covered walls and steaming brews immerse effectively, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Maris’s journey, with decent use of symbolism (glasses, jams), but subtext is underdeveloped; the ending is satisfying yet lacks a lingering punch or deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the surreal setting and jam-tasting method show originality, some metaphors (e.g., “damp salt”) feel generic; emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the tea house and jams, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a mild lingering thought about healing, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
