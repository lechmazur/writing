<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s shyness and role as a diviner are present, but her internal conflict and motivation lack depth and specificity; her actions feel somewhat detached from a fully realized personality, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of precipitating a vision driving the story, but the social media method feels slightly contrived; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolutions and underdeveloped causal links between timelines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater city market is vividly described with sensory details like bioluminescent haze and coral-encrusted stalls, enhancing the mood of regret; however, the setting’s connection to the method (social media) feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of regret, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution is surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining timelines and underwater decay with social media, but some metaphors (e.g., “echo of regret”) feel overused; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and tone wavers slightly, though no glaring AI-like inconsistencies appear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive enough with its elements, but they often drive the narrative rather than serve it; the style is clear but not striking, and while there’s creative thinking, the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
