<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elyse’s death wish as a poison taster is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to map energy flows feels disconnected from her profession, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the collapsing ice sculpture driving tension, but the connection between interpreting radio calls and the action feels tenuous and rushed, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall setting is vividly described with strong sensory details (mist, roar, refracted light), enhancing the tone of serene upheaval and supporting Elyse’s motivation, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative response with imagery and subtext about legacy versus oblivion, but the ending wavers in impact, and the central conflict lacks sharpness; it shows more than tells, yet lacks deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of hidden societies and radio calls offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “inner storm”) feel generic, and Elyse’s reasoning lacks nuanced human emotion, leaning toward overly logical exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the waterfall and energy flows, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
