<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to tame darkness is clear and tied to personal loss, but Tobin's joviality feels inconsistent with the depth of his grief and obsession, lacking nuanced integration into his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between enduring and the metronome method is intriguing but underdeveloped, leading to a somewhat abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The attic setting is vividly described with sensory details like oil and iron, enhancing the atmosphere of chaos, but the timeframe of the departing train feels tangential and underutilized in supporting the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through Tobinâ€™s loss and determination, with decent use of symbolism (earring, metronome), but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the theme of human endurance feels stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of taming darkness is unique, the execution relies on somewhat predictable tropes of the mad inventor; metaphors like "forge embers" are overused, and emotional depth feels more stated than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the metronome, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking deeper resonance.</comment>
