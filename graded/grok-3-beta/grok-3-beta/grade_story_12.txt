<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters Elias and Lila are defined by their shared ache and motivations, but their development feels surface-level; the aloofness of Elias is stated rather than deeply explored through actions or nuanced dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the kayaking action feels forced as a plot driver, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolutions that undermine coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, but the connection between setting and cracked tile feels tenuous, slightly diluting the mood's impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through shared loss, with decent use of symbolism (cracked tile), but dialogue lacks natural flow, and the theme of soul's language feels underexplored, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery (holographic moon) is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable emotional beats and generic descriptors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
