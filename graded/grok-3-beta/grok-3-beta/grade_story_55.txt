<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lysander’s portrayal as a romantically doomed bard is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and somewhat repetitive, lacking depth in emotional nuance beyond surface-level mourning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of eliciting a response feels vague and disconnected from a concrete resolution, leaving the story’s progression somewhat aimless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The utopia design studio setting is intriguing and contrasts well with the tone of forgotten revelry, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic mood and uses symbolism (keys, bell) effectively, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a sharp, memorable punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a bard in a utopian studio is unique, the writing leans on flowery language and predictable tropes of doomed romance, lacking fresh metaphors and showing signs of overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often obscures clarity with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
