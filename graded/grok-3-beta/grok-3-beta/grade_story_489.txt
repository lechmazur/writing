<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but the "aggressively kind" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes actions beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the whistle's fling as a climactic action, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the whale's call and the action lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly described with sensory details like cracked glass and sea howls, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection between setting and the plastic whistle feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of lost traditions, with some effective imagery, but the ending lacks impact, and the central conflict feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of an unseen observer is intriguing, the narrative relies on predictable tropes of ghostly intervention and forgotten wisdom without subversion, and the language occasionally veers into overly ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering depth or truly creative integration of ideas.</comment>
