<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to witness pure grace is clear, but Elias's impassive and personally impersonal traits feel underexplored, lacking depth in how they shape his internal conflict or actions beyond stoicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between action (stretch) and bees’ language as a method lacks stronger causal integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting of the lush orchard in a cathedral is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (humming bees, dripping honey), enhancing atmosphere and supporting the tone of cautious bravery exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes awe through imagery and theme of nature’s triumph, with strong symbolism (hive as altar), but emotional impact is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth; ending is satisfying yet not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in setting and concept of bees’ language, but metaphors (twist tie as talisman) feel slightly forced; emotional portrayal leans toward stating awe rather than nuanced showing, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the cathedral orchard, leaving a lingering sense of grace, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and depth is constrained by limited character exploration.</comment>
