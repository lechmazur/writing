<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ezra’s insomnia and poetic nature are present but underdeveloped; motivation for non-violence feels vague and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but rushed; the resolution of surrendering obsession feels abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Haunted attic setting is evocative with strong sensory details like whispering leaves, but the subway timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (botanical samples as power) are compelling, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending is purposeful but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable gothic tropes without subversion; metaphors like “whispers fading” feel generic rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
