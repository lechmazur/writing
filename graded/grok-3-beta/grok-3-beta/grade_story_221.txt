<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s dual role as wreck-diver and ghost whisperer shapes her actions, but her motivation to escape her family’s legacy feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her voice is distinct but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional beats; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details and enhances the melancholic tone; however, the connection between setting and timeframe feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mara’s connection with the ghost, and imagery like the amber’s glow is effective; yet, the central conflict lacks intensity, and the theme of rebellion feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., “thawing heart”) are predictable; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering impact or profound depth, falling short of top-tier literary resonance.</comment>
