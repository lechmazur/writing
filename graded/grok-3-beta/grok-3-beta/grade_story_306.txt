<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to escape into madness is clear and aligns with her past as a former child star, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond quirks like mismatched socks; her voice lacks distinct depth in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the map and frequency driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber is vividly described and enhances the tone of irreverent awe; sensory details like buzzing machines are effective, though the cathedral window feels underexplored in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of tragic ambition through imagery and subtext, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-telling Lila’s state of mind; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of merging vibration analysis with magic is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., “dying bulb”) feel generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the map and chamber, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
