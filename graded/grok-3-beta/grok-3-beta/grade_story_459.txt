<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marvin's ability to see ghosts shapes his unique perspective, and his motivation to liberate both the ghost and himself is clear, but his personality lacks deeper nuance beyond the "elegantly clumsy" trait, which feels somewhat surface-level in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between staking out ghost tours and the resolution is logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is an evocative and unusual setting that enhances the ghostly atmosphere, with sensory details like the "faint grit of ancient beaches" adding immersion, though the timeframe of lunch breaks feels underutilized in deepening the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Marvin's personal liberation, with effective symbolism in the flower crown and sand castle, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch, and the theme of letting go feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique setting and concept, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors like "fractured peace" feel familiar, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at a lack of distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans on ornate phrasing that obscures clarity, and the lingering impact is present yet not profoundly memorable.</comment>
