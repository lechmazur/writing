<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to overcome prejudice against physical closeness is clear and aligns with her role as a professional cuddler, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond this single trait, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions to deepen her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the concept of unspoken rules driving tension, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the phantom ticket punch and the resolution is more symbolic than logical, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly described with an ancient novelty tone, enhancing the atmosphere of decay, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to Mara’s motivation feels more incidental than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mara’s quiet rebellion, and the ticket punch serves as a potent symbol, but the writing leans heavily on telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the premise of a cuddler in a decayed spaceport offers some originality, the metaphors (e.g., “ghosts of voyages”) are somewhat generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, often stating feelings rather than showing them, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity, and the overall impact lacks the depth needed for a lasting impression.</comment>
