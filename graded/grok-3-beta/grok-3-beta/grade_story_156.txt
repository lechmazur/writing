<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's struggle between duty and connection, but his personality lacks depth beyond confusion and timid resolve; reactions to the computer key feel symbolic but not deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy reliance on introspection; the connection between bus rides and trade liberalization is logical but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting of the eerie salt mine village is vividly described and enhances the mood, but sensory details are inconsistently applied; atmosphere supports the tone, though integration with character motivation feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through Elias's struggle, and symbolism of birds is effective, but the ending lacks punch; subtext is present but not fully layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "counterpoint of hearts" feel overused and vague; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, risking formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and lingering impact is muted.</comment>
