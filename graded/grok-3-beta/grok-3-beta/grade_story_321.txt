<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of displacing guilt feels abstract and the resolution via the hourglass is rushed, lacking full coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic silence is intriguing, the story leans on familiar tropes of guilt and redemption without fresh subversion; metaphors like “boiling time” feel slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
