<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thalen’s motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond the rebellious hermit archetype; his actions align with his goal, yet his voice and inner world remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the sprout as resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the translation action drives the story, though connections between elements like the weathervane and outcome feel forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a striking, cohesive atmosphere that enhances the tone of desolation and hope; sensory details are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Thalen’s resolve, with decent use of symbolism (comet as doom, sprout as hope), but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While imagery like the comet and orchard feels fresh, the hermit’s journey leans on familiar tropes of solitary defiance; language is occasionally ornate, and emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a mild lingering thought of renewal, though not profoundly.</comment>
