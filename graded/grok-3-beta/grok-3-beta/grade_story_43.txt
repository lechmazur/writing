<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's introverted nature and motivation to reclaim courage are present, but his personality lacks depth and distinct voice; reactions to the CD feel symbolic but not deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with meandering driving exploration, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and post-human timeframe create a striking, cohesive atmosphere; sensory details like glowing spires and fog are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (CD as courage) add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings rather than nuanced showing; central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, metaphors like "dying heartbeat" feel overused; emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings, lacking nuanced subtext, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style sometimes hinders clarity with florid language; it leaves a lingering mood, though creative integration feels more dutiful than inspired.</comment>
