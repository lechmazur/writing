<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jericho’s recklessness and meticulously careless nature are evident, but his sudden shift to vulnerability feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation; the childhood promise is introduced too abruptly to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from recklessness to seeking companionship is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between the forgotten promise and the resolution lacks sufficient buildup for coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The misty forest and abandoned funfair create a strong, evocative atmosphere that supports the tone of bold vulnerability, but sensory details are inconsistently vivid, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional impact through Jericho’s transformation, but the symbolism of the lens and funfair feels heavy-handed; dialogue is purposeful but lacks natural flow, and the theme of companionship is surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a reckless hunter seeking redemption is intriguing, the execution relies on predictable tropes of haunted pasts and sudden epiphanies; metaphors like the lens as a mirror are overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a faint lingering thought, but lacks the depth for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
