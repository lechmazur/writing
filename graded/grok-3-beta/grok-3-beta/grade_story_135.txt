<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tharren’s ambition and loyalty are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond his obsession; motivation is consistent but not nuanced, and his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at times; the connection between deciphering bruises and rediscovering dialects is intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, evocative atmosphere that supports the tone of peculiar faith; sensory details are strong, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Tharren’s struggle, but lacks deeper subtext; imagery is effective, yet the ending feels predictable and lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the concept of lost dialects is original, some metaphors (e.g., “divining rod”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profound one.</comment>
