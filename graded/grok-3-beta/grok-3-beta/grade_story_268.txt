<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s subdued nature as a vigilante is reflected in his quiet demeanor and non-violent approach, but his motivation to uncover a comrade’s fate feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional depth; his interaction with the bead is symbolic but not revelatory of deeper character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with virtual calls driving the search for truth, but the mirror-distortion method feels contrived and disrupts logical flow; pacing is uneven, with rushed revelations at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area is vividly described with sensory details like dust and silence, enhancing the desolate tone, but the connection between setting and the funhouse mirror feels forced; atmosphere supports the war-haunted mood moderately well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with the price of war, but it often tells rather than shows Elias’s pain; imagery like the mirror’s distortions is intriguing but overexplained, reducing impact; the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of divination via mirror distortions is unique, the story leans on war-related tropes without subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and phrases like “screaming silence” feel repetitive and slightly clichéd.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but the mirror and ancient art feel awkwardly integrated; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a faint lingering thought but lacks depth.</comment>
