<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias’s drive to prevent future tragedies, but his "passionately indifferent" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy focus on internal reflection over action, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than narrative, lacking a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like old wood and wax, effectively supporting the mood of grief and secrecy, though the secret society hall’s relevance to the miner’s story feels slightly tangential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through Elias’s grief and purpose, with strong imagery like the silent bell as a symbol of failure, but the ending lacks a punch, feeling more contemplative than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “buried beneath rubble”) feel predictable, and emotional depth relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, missing a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with a lingering sense of purpose, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
