<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eamon's hardheaded nature and brokenness are evident, but his motivation feels surface-level, lacking deeper nuance or internal conflict beyond the stated desire for solace. His actions align with his traits, but his voice and reactions lack distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the struggle driving the narrative forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between the prophecy and the summit is underdeveloped, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery and snow days create a vivid, cold atmosphere that mirrors Eamon’s emotional state. Sensory details like crunching boots and biting snow are effective, though some descriptions lack specificity, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eamon’s quest, with some imagery and symbolism (gallery as fleeting hope). However, the conflict feels predictable, and the ending lacks a strong punch or deeper subtext, limiting overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on familiar tropes of a broken seeker and mystical prophecy without fresh subversion. Descriptions are occasionally generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic. The style is clear but unremarkable, and while it leaves a lingering question, it lacks the depth or creativity for a truly lasting impression.</comment>
