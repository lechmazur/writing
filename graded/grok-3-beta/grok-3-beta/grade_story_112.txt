<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Egon's motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond the aimless traveler trope; reactions to the handkerchief feel symbolic yet underdeveloped in revealing nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the grilling action feels forced as a climax; pacing is uneven with rushed transitions, and the hopscotch method, while creative, disrupts logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is evocative with strong sensory details like the scent of old paper, enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe metaphor feels detached, and the setting's connection to grilling is weak.</comment>
