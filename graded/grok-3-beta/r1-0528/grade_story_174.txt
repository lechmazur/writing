<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arisâ€™s motivation to correct a past regret is clear and tied to his creative attribute, but his personality feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions beyond regret and determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between frost patterns and fireworks design lacks deeper logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The waterfall library setting is evocative with strong sensory details like damp stone and thundering water, enhancing the atmosphere of ephemerality, though the integration with the timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the visual of fireworks as an apology, with strong imagery and subtext, but the central conflict feels somewhat surface-level, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fireworks mimicking natural patterns is original, some metaphors (e.g., leaves as regret) feel predictable, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit description than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of nature and art, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
