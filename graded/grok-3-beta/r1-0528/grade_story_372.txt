<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Wraith's lovelorn nature is hinted at but not deeply explored, and motivations feel surface-level despite the betrayal backdrop. Kael’s indifference is intriguing but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure holds a clear arc within the word limit, with a chase driving momentum, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional beats, and some cause-effect links, like the cleaners’ sudden adaptability, are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The futuristic slums are vividly rendered with strong sensory details (neon, decay, synth-noodles), enhancing atmosphere and action, though the setting occasionally overshadows character depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes tension and some emotional resonance through Wraith’s haunted reflections, but dialogue feels stilted at times, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution; subtext is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on cyberpunk tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like “avalanche” are overused, and emotional nuance is sometimes stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of urban exploration, but style occasionally leans on cliché, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
