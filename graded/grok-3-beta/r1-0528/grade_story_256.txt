<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Bertram’s kindness is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to seize the horizon’s promise feels somewhat abstract and lacks grounding in personal stakes, though the “loyally disloyal” attribute shapes his conflict well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot progression feels uneven; the transition to the floating cafe is abrupt, and while the action of worship drives the narrative, the resolution lacks a strong causal link to prior events, feeling more symbolic than conclusive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating island cloud cafe and midnight grocery store create a striking contrast, and sensory details like “susurration of clouds” enhance atmosphere, but the setting’s connection to Bertram’s motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery like “liquid starlight” and the spoon as a probe into time are compelling, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract language; the central conflict is present but not sharply defined, and the ending feels more enigmatic than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of soft edges of time offers originality, the story leans on surreal tropes without fully subverting them; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often overextended, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its surreal elements, but the style often obscures clarity; the brief length feels somewhat limiting, and the lingering impact is muted by an abstract resolution.</comment>
