<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to "sculpt a new tomorrow" is clear, but the tailor's restlessness feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in personality or distinct voice beyond generic anxiety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a mystery driving toward resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some ghostly appearances disrupt logical flow within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of Mars' biodome is vividly rendered with sensory details like thin air and failing systems, strongly supporting the atmosphere of decay and tension, though some details feel slightly repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes unease and curiosity through mystery, with decent imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance; the ending feels functional rather than profoundly satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining sci-fi decay with ghostly mystery, but reliance on predictable "hidden survivor" trope and generic descriptors like "creeping chaos" detract from uniqueness; emotional nuance is present but shallow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
