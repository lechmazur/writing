<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of lament driving a shift to determination, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the button's role in the method lacks clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin is vividly realized and enhances the isolation central to the story; sensory details like the flag's snap are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel detached from character emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic longing through imagery, but the central conflict feels underdeveloped; symbolism of the button and flag is intriguing yet leans on 'telling' over 'showing' emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise is unique, the narrative relies on somewhat generic cosmic metaphors and lacks fresh emotional nuance; style feels ornate at times, bordering on purple prose, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but overly complex language hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of connection, yet feels constrained rather than deliberate in brevity.</comment>
