<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's meekness and sincerity as a necromancer are well-defined and drive her introspective journey, but her internal transformation lacks deeper conflict or unique voice to fully flesh out her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the dew drop revelation effectively driving the resolution; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing subtle buildup to the epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city and mystic tone are vividly rendered with sensory details like phosphorescence and playground echoes, enhancing the atmosphere, though the setting's potential impact on Elara's actions feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (dew drop as cosmos) and imagery evokes reflection on interconnectedness; the ending is satisfying, but the emotional resonance remains somewhat surface-level due to limited showing of Elara's inner struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh take on necromancy and soul-weaving, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (broken nib as fractured perception) feel slightly predictable, and emotional depth lacks nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the dew drop and tapestry; it leaves a lingering thought on perception, though stylistic flourishes occasionally border on overwrought, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
