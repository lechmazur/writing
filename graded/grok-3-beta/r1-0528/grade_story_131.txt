<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli’s aloofness is well-portrayed through his detachment, but his sudden shift toward courage feels underdeveloped given the brevity; motivation is clear but lacks deeper nuance or voice to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the gravitational anomaly drives the narrative, yet cause-effect links between the message and Eli’s transformation are thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly described with sensory details like the hum and vibrating floor, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the garage cleaning timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected from deeper mood-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eli’s internal shift, with effective symbolism in the stones as anchors; yet, the conflict resolution feels too abrupt, and the theme of courage lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on the anomaly, but metaphors like “anchor” and “current” are somewhat predictable; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking a truly distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the anomaly and stones; however, the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, and the lingering impact is modest due to underdeveloped depth.</comment>
