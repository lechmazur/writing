<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bjorn’s portrayal as a spirited lumberjack is clear, and his gracefully awkward attribute shapes his interactions in the restaurant setting effectively. However, his motivation to learn healing traditions feels slightly disconnected from his initial characterization, lacking deeper emotional grounding or nuance in his internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the action of revamping the ossuary’s purpose, and the concept of hidden agendas drives the narrative forward. However, pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the cause-effect relationship between the coded letter and the temporal rupture is underexplored, leaving some logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant is a striking setting that enhances the story’s eerie tone and complements the concept of hidden agendas. Sensory details like polished femurs as candleholders are evocative, but the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motivation, and the bike rides feel underintegrated into the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of intrigue and tension through the temporal rupture concept, and imagery like “time’s fragile marrow” is memorable. However, the ending feels more conceptually satisfying than emotionally resonant, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness. Subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining an ossuary restaurant with temporal healing, avoiding common tropes. However, some metaphors like “bull in a porcelain shop” are overused, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing. The style is individual but occasionally veers into ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite numerous elements, and the creative combination of temporal healing and an ossuary setting is notable. However, the style occasionally obscures clarity with dense imagery, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
