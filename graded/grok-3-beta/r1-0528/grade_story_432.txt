<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's role as a poison taster with a death wish is intriguing, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; the transition from self-destruction to purpose lacks depth and nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence within the word limit with a discernible arc, but the action of binding energy flows feels rushed at the climax, undermining cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the serene yet tense atmosphere; however, the connection to the ice sculpture feels slightly contrived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining hidden societies and energy mapping, some metaphors (e.g., "silent tsunami") are overused, and emotional depth relies too much on explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
