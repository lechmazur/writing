<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leo's jadedness is clear, but his sudden shift to optimistic desperation feels under-explored; motivation is present but lacks depth in execution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the method of decoding receipts, while creative, stretches believability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and curiosity, with some effective symbolism (scalpel as accusation), but the ending feels abrupt, and emotional depth is told more than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows creativity in combining elements, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "frantic hope") are generic, and emotional nuance is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with intriguing use of elements, but the style occasionally leans ornate, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; it lingers but lacks polish for top-tier impact.</comment>
