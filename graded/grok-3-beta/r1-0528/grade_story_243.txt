<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's jumpy nature as a necromancer is reflected in his actions and reactions, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced depth or distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and end, driven by the action of faltering; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly rendered with sensory details like pixelated streets and corrupted data, enhancing the atmosphere of tension; however, the timeframe of "old gods slumbering" feels underutilized in grounding the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and curiosity, with some effective imagery (e.g., puppet master code), but the ending feels abrupt, and emotional depth is more told than shown; subtext exists but lacks refinement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a corrupt digital saint is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "guitar strings") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing; originality is present but not fully polished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of tension, but style occasionally overreaches with dense descriptions, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
