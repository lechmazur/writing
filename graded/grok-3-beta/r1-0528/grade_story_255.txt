<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seer's nondescript nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; their motivation to unearth the relic is clear, but their personality lacks depth or a distinct voice, making their actions feel somewhat mechanical despite alignment with their obsessive drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with the USB decryption driving the narrative, and there’s a clear arc within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the sensory method, while innovative, risks straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like the petrichor memory; yet, the setting’s connection to the relic’s burial feels underexplored, slightly weakening its impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its temporal justice theme and symbolic scent-memory, but the emotional resonance is muted by over-telling; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a deeply satisfying punch, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of sensory decryption is original, avoiding clichés, but the writing occasionally leans on overly ornate phrasing; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers slightly, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, and the style supports clarity, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering question about justice, yet lacks the depth for true memorability.</comment>
