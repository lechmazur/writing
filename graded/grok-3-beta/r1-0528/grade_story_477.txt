<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape suppression is clear, but the "graceful swordsman" attribute feels underutilized—grace is mentioned but not deeply integrated into actions or personality beyond superficial elegance; lacks distinct voice or depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the connection between scavenging and the gate’s activation feels forced and lacks clarity in execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly rendered with sensory details like bioluminescent anemones and bird songs, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting’s connection to the character’s motivation feels tangential rather than central.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes awe and panic at the leviathans’ awakening, with some effective imagery, but the ending lacks satisfaction; conflict is present but resolution feels abrupt and subtext is underdeveloped for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining cosmic signals with an underwater ruin, but relies on trope of ancient entities without subversion; sensory details are specific yet occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative rather than serve it; style is clear yet lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels like a constraint, not a choice, with limited lingering impact.</comment>
