<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Professor Alistair Finch’s motivation to claim an uncharted frontier is clear, but his personality as an old-fashioned mage feels underdeveloped; his actions lack depth beyond the assigned traits, and there’s little distinct voice to anchor the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the unfolding riddle and the action of cuddling feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions between mirrors and reflections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arctic research greenhouse is vividly realized with sensory details like fogged panes and cold glass, enhancing the tone of sanctified dread, though the playground timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the central mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a lingering dread and uses symbolism effectively (mirrors, sarcophagus), but the ending lacks full satisfaction; tension is present but not sharply defined, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of temporal frontiers and mirror reflections offers originality, some imagery (e.g., “slipping sands of time”) feels clichéd; emotional handling is nuanced at times but occasionally stated directly, lacking consistent depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with creative use of elements like the coffin fragment, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
