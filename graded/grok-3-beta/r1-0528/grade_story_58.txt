<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris’s loyalty as a scout is evident, but her internal conflict and motivation lack depth and specificity; her reactions feel somewhat predictable and underdeveloped given the story’s ambitious scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the coded message discovery, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a fully satisfying payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city create a vivid, eerie atmosphere that complements the tone of dread, though sensory details could be more varied and specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes tension through the coded message reveal, and symbolism like the moth-and-storm is effective, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character exploration and a somewhat abrupt ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of coded comedy as radicalization is original, and metaphors are fresh, but some phrasing feels overly ornate, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the tower and coded message, but overly dense prose occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a strength.</comment>
