<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to make peace with the past is clear, but the shaky mercenary's personality feels underdeveloped beyond trembling hands and reckless poise; dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves a sense of resolution with the amber's destruction, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between rumors and the final act are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like dripping water and city hum, enhancing the mood of longing and decay; atmosphere strongly supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a subtle emotional response with the amber's symbolism, but the ending feels more abrupt than satisfying; dialogue is functional but lacks depth; subtext is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some imagery (amber as petrified guilt) is fresh, but reliance on tropes like the haunted mercenary and dramatic artifact destruction feels predictable; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; length feels constrained rather than deliberate; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
