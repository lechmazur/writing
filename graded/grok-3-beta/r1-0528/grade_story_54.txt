<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's even-tempered nature is reflected in his calm under pressure, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit; motivation to preserve hunting techniques is clear, yet personal stakes feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by the offload action and tracking star patterns, with a clear arc from setup to tension; pacing is managed well, though the ending feels slightly abrupt, lacking a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like dust and ghostly echoes, enhancing the mood of elegant chaos; atmosphere supports Kael’s mission, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and subtle regret, with strong imagery (starlight, dust motes); however, deeper subtext and emotional resonance are limited by stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; conflict is clear but resolution lacks impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, some metaphors (frantic fireflies) feel slightly overused; emotional handling leans on description rather than subtext; tone is consistent but lacks a truly distinctive style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like star patterns and the carnival setting; style supports clarity, but depth is constrained by length, leaving only a moderate lingering impact.</comment>
