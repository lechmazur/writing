<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to master strategy is clear and ties to both bees and snow tracks, but the hermit beekeeper's personality feels underdeveloped beyond isolation and sharpness; lacks deeper emotional nuance or distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a subtle conflict via the intern interaction, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; connection between kneading and strategic study is tenuous, reducing coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting on the quasar observation deck paired with the cosmic hush creates a striking contrast with earthly snow tracks; sensory details of snow and dough are evocative, though the atmosphere occasionally feels detached from character emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild reflection on strategy in small and grand scales via strong imagery, but emotional impact is muted; dialogue is purposeful but not natural; ending feels thoughtful yet lacks a deeper punch or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style through unique contrasts (cosmic vs. terrestrial), but metaphors like "Earth's frozen skin" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but leans on explicit reflection rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like snow tracks and kneading, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; brief length works but doesn't fully capitalize on depth, leaving impact slightly underwhelming.</comment>
