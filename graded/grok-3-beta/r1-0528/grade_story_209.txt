<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The woodsman’s motivation as a tribute to lost love is clear, and his grief shapes his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond sorrow; the "artfully messy" attribute feels underexplored in his character beyond a surface metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from quest to realization is complete, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional shifts; the short-circuit drives a turning point, yet the method of measuring echoes seems contrived within the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden and abandoned water tower create a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of loss; sensory details like humming fields are evocative, though the connection between setting and object feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes grief and prompts reflection on unprocessed loss, with strong symbolism in the hairbrush; however, the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and some emotions are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the emotional arc shows nuance, the story leans on familiar tropes of grief and ghostly memory without subversion; metaphors like “tangible ghost” feel slightly overused, and the tone shifts are occasionally abrupt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of grief and technology; it leaves a lingering sense of loss, but overly complex language occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
