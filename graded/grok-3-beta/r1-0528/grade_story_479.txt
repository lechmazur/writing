<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear and consistent, but the glamorous undertaker's personality feels underdeveloped beyond surface traits; lacks a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within word limit with a clear beginning and end, but pacing is unevenâ€”some reflective moments drag while key actions feel rushed; logical flow is maintained but not compellingly driven by the action of elongation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the social network archive as a digital cemetery is evocative and supports the theme of fading traditions; sensory details like fluorescent lights and paint mixing are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (brass tape, twilight paint) and subtext around death's ordinariness evokes thought, but emotional resonance is muted by overly explicit reflections; ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original in concept with fresh metaphors like "Veil of Passage," but some phrases feel ornate and risk purple prose; emotional handling shows nuance in jubilant remorse, yet overall style lacks a distinct authorial imprint and occasionally feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length suits the reflective tone; leaves a lingering thought on death's profundity, but style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaboration.</comment>
