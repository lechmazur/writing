<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aris’s confidence as a watchman is evident in his patrolling and leadership, but his motivation to hush envy feels underdeveloped and inconsistently tied to his actions, lacking deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to mobilization is clear, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the fingerprint discovery and hive defense feels slightly forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant beehive setting is vividly realized with sensory details like waxy walls and humming peace, enhancing the atmosphere, though the timeframe of coloring sessions feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes empathy through Aris’s jubilant remorse, and imagery like the cracked ruler as a symbol is effective, but the emotional depth and subtext of yearning lack sharpness, feeling more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the beehive perspective offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable themes of duty and longing without subverting them, and emotional descriptions occasionally feel generic rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, with creative use of the ruler and fingerprint, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the depth of lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
