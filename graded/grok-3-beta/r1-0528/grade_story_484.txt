<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to honor the dead is clear but undermined by inconsistent cynicism; the groggy brewer's personality feels partially developed, lacking a distinct voice or deeper nuance in reactions to the mirror shard and darkness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action to initiate confrontation, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the protest and internal events are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted mansion graveyard setting and encroaching darkness create a chilling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the scent of hops and decay, though the protest's integration into the mood feels peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild dread and tension via the staircase ascent, with some symbolism in the mirror shard, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance; the ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with atmospheric descriptions, but relies on predictable haunted house tropes without subversion; metaphors like "ale warming his veins" feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style supports clarity, yet the brief length feels like a limitation, lacking a lingering impact or deeper question.</comment>
