<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas’s skittish nature is evident, but his deeper motivations and voice feel underdeveloped; the connection to the ballet shoes reveals little beyond surface-level anxiety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven, with a rushed resolution; the action of pioneering ties loosely to the concept, lacking stronger cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is evocative with some sensory detail, enhancing the sterile atmosphere, but the barbershop timeframe feels underutilized; the object-setting connection is tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but not exceptional; elements are integrated but don’t elevate beyond their assignment; style is clear but uninspired, lacking a lingering, profound impact.</comment>
