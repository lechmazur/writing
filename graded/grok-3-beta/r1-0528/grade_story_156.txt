<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The diplomat’s confusion and motivation to understand evolutionary wisdom are clear and drive his internal conflict, but his personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits; his voice feels somewhat generic without distinctiveness in thought or expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of liberalizing trade providing direction, but the pacing feels uneven—moments of revelation are rushed while descriptive detours slow momentum. Coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like salt-crusted walls and bioluminescent fungi, enhancing the mood of isolation and wonder. It supports the character’s motivation well, though the timeframe of bus rides feels underutilized in deepening atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through the metaphor of the flock and the theme of decentralized harmony, with a satisfying ending. However, emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the flock metaphor is fresh and the setting original, the narrative leans on predictable diplomatic tropes without subversion. Emotional handling is more stated than nuanced, and some descriptive language feels ornate, bordering on purple prose, detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the flock and salt mine, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with dense phrasing. It leaves a lingering thought about harmony, yet the brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
