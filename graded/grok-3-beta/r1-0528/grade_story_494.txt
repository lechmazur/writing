<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s arrogance and doubt are well-portrayed through his actions and internal conflict, but his sudden shift to selflessness feels slightly unearned, lacking deeper exploration of his transformation within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, crisis, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the messenger’s news and Kaelen’s decision lacks nuanced build-up, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and sensory details like gravel crunching and pine scent effectively ground the atmosphere, enhancing the tone of harsh tenderness, though the timeframe "between breaths" feels more stylistic than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kaelen’s struggle and the phoenix symbolism, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and subtext, while present, isn’t fully layered due to brevity constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a personal style, some metaphors (e.g., “shackles broken”) feel overused, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the tapestry and song, leaving a lingering sense of defiance, but stylistic flourishes occasionally overshadow clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
