<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian’s naivety as a gambler is evident, but his motivation feels overwrought and inconsistently tied to his actions; the candle-making ritual lacks depth in revealing his psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete with a rushed ending; while the dock scene ties to the gamble, cause and effect are muddled, and pacing stumbles under forced thematic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative with strong sensory details like crashing waves, but the atmosphere’s connection to candlelit dinners feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (unfinished candle as lost hope) resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; the ending lacks satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some originality exists in the setting, the narrative leans on predictable despair tropes, and metaphors like "oblivion swallowed him" feel clichéd and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves partial cohesion with creative elements like the station, but style often overreaches with heavy prose, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
