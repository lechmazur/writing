<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's amiability is implied but not deeply shown through actions or interactions; his motivation to fuse lore and dreams is clear but lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory, limiting character resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from waiting to vindication is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy focus on atmosphere over action; logical flow is maintained, though the carrier pigeon resolution feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly evoked with sensory details like thrumming timbers and dust-moted gloom, enhancing the mood of mystery and hope; atmosphere strongly supports the concept, though some details feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response with its theme of bridging past and future, supported by strong imagery like the lighthouse as a beacon of resilience; however, the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling over showing, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of ghostly echoes and scholarly pursuit, some metaphors (e.g., "fertile ground") feel generic; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuance, with feelings often stated rather than shown; overall style is distinct but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels intentional; creative use of timbers as storytellers stands out, but overly elaborate prose sometimes hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
