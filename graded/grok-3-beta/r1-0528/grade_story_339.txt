<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to hush old guilt is clear and drives the narrative, but the "joyless performer" lacks depth beyond melancholy; reactions to the drawer knob and seesaw feel symbolic yet underdeveloped in revealing unique personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from internal chaos to a bearable melody is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the seesaw method drives the story logically, though its connection to "organize" feels more metaphorical than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prismatic lake and construction setting create a vivid, fractured atmosphere that mirrors the character’s turmoil; sensory details like the seesaw squeak are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on guilt and accountability through strong symbolism (seesaw, knob), but emotional impact is somewhat muted by overt narration over showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids clichés and shows individual style through metaphors like the seesaw’s rhythm, but some descriptors (e.g., “dissolving world”) feel generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully resonant due to stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the seesaw and lake; style supports clarity, but brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a thoughtful impression, though not profoundly memorable.</comment>
