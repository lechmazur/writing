<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is subtly present but not sharply defined; motivation to learn traditional methods is clear but lacks deeper emotional grounding. Reactions to the rope and ghost feel somewhat mechanical, missing nuanced personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the tango driving a unique resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments. Cause and effect are mostly logical, though the shift to dancing feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like damp walls and ghostly groans, enhancing the mood. However, the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue through the tango with a ghost, and the ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character depth. Literary devices like the rope as a symbol of promises are effective but not fully layered. Subtext is present but not profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The tango with a ghost is an original concept, but execution relies on predictable ghostly tropes without subversion. Writing style is distinct but occasionally over-ornate, with some descriptors feeling generic rather than vivid. Emotional nuance is present but not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the tango and lighthouse, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate. It leaves a lingering image, though not a deep question or feeling. Style supports the narrative but isnâ€™t exceptional.</comment>
