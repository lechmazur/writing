<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlo’s vigilance and background as an orchardist are reflected in his meticulous observation, but his motivation to overcome personal tragedy feels somewhat underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional portrayal. His voice is distinct but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of demonstrating sabotage driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect relationships could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility setting is unique but underutilized in sensory detail; the atmosphere supports the tone of sardonic glee minimally, and the connection between setting and action feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Arlo’s grief, and the ending is satisfying, but literary devices like the apple metaphor feel forced; subtext is present but lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows ingenuity, some metaphors (e.g., tart apple) are generic, and emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing; the narrative style feels slightly formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so, and the brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
