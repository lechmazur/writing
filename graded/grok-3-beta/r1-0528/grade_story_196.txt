<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the hidden promise driving action, but the "fiercely apathetic" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, clashing with the spark of defiance; lacks distinct voice or deeper internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with meteor showers effectively driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end lacks emotional weight or surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the floating rock monastery is vivid and enhances the ethereal tone, with meteor showers integrating well into the atmosphere, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the kept promise, with strong use of starlight imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like "celestial fire" are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of spiritual quests without subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; leaves a lingering thought of defiance, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
