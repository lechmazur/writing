<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's hesitancy and "shyly loud" attribute are well-reflected in her trembling fingers and blooming voice, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes beyond the collective sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from despair to fragile hope is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the dream-hopping method drives the narrative logically, though its impact on the resolution lacks specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel and year-crossing timeframe create a sterile, haunting atmosphere that enhances the fragility of time; sensory details like the humming tunnel are vivid, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes empathy through shared grief and uses strong symbolism with the dinosaur plush, but the emotional depth feels constrained by overt telling rather than nuanced showing; the ending is purposeful yet slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the dream-hopping and tunnel setting offer originality, some metaphors (e.g., "temporal tide") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but lacks subtlety, with stated feelings occasionally overshadowing subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, but the integration feels slightly forced at times; it leaves a lingering sense of hope, though the style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity.</comment>
