<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows promise with Milo’s unique trait of seeing ghosts influencing his actions, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the shift to “letting go” lacks deeper backstory or emotional grounding to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the ghost tour method is intriguing but underexplored, leaving the resolution slightly abrupt and less impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is evocative and ties well to the atmosphere of fragility and preservation, enhancing the theme, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has emotional potential with the theme of letting go, and symbolism of the sand castle and crown is effective, but the impact is dulled by limited subtext and a resolution that feels more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique setting and concept, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable ghost story tropes without subversion; emotional nuance exists but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly memorable one.</comment>
