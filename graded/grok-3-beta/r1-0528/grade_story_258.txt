<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous dances is clear, but the locksmith’s nimbleness feels underutilized beyond physical description; personality lacks distinct depth or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining surreal elements, but metaphors like “storm of secrets” feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not profoundly deep.</comment>
