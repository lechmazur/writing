<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aris’s stubbornness and piety are evident, and his motivation to avenge Linus while battling his dark reflection is compelling, but the internal conflict feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper nuance in his reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from dream to resolve, driven by the action of avenging, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between clues and resolution lacks depth, risking incoherence under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aerial gondola setting is vividly described with sensory details like the howling wind, enhancing the cautious enchantment tone, though the connection between setting and flute feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension through Aris’s internal struggle and the murder mystery, with some effective imagery (e.g., “grim reaper of truth”), but the ending lacks emotional punch, and subtext is present yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of mystery and monkhood, some metaphors (e.g., “burning coal”) feel generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative use of the flute and label, but the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, and the impact is solid yet not lingering or profound enough for top-tier status.</comment>
