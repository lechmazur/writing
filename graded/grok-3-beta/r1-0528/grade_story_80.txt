<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of erosion driving a climactic reveal, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and some causal links between the logs and the coaster are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is vividly described with sensory details like rust flaking and groaning metal, enhancing the eerie tone of quiet mania, though the timeframe "amid page turns" feels abstract and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on time's endlessness through strong symbolism and a satisfying ending, but it occasionally tells rather than shows emotion, and the central conflict feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors like "rust flaking like dried blood" feel slightly overused, and emotional depth lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings over subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of eternity, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
