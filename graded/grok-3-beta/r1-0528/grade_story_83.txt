<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Aris Thorne’s motivation to expose unethical experiments is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "undercover researcher" archetype. His suspiciously trusting nature is mentioned but not deeply explored in actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, especially in the analysis scene. The connection between the mirror maze and the candle’s story is intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth of broken mirrors is vividly described and enhances the eerie atmosphere, complemented by sensory details like the sound of leaf raking. However, the setting’s connection to character motivation feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear central conflict and some thematic depth about hidden truths, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level character exploration. Imagery of the mirror maze is strong, yet the ending lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of tracing a candle wick for evidence is original, and the mirror maze offers a fresh visual, but the narrative leans on cryptid tropes without subversion. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but it doesn’t fully transcend the constraints of its length or elements. It leaves a mild lingering thought about hidden truths, yet lacks profound depth or stylistic distinction.</comment>
