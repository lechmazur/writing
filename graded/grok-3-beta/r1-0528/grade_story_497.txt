<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris’s daydreaming nature is mentioned but not deeply integrated into his actions or decisions; his motivation to create a masterpiece is clear but lacks personal depth or conflict, feeling somewhat generic for a scholar archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the discovery and decoding driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the satellite’s role as a catalyst is intriguing yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The submerged palace and post-glacial timeframe create a vivid, haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details like “algae-draped ballroom”; however, the tone of pristine chaos could be more consistently woven into the emotional undercurrent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on compassion and interconnectedness, with strong imagery and a satisfying ending, but the theme feels slightly overt, lacking subtlety in delivery, and the conflict is understated for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining a skating rink with coded messages and a satellite sliver, but some descriptions (e.g., “hauntingly beautiful”) lean on familiar tropes, and emotional resonance could be shown more through nuanced action rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the scuff marks and satellite, leaving a lingering thought on empathy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
