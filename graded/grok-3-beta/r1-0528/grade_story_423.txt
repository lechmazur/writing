<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Alistair's earnestness as a knight is evident, but his inner depth and personal voice remain underdeveloped; motivation to spark flames in a frozen land feels surface-level without nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the map's activation as a pivotal action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between greenhouse tears and cosmic blueprint are somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arid desert and ruined aqueduct create a vivid, desolate atmosphere that enhances the tone of crisp nostalgia; sensory details like shattered glass and dusty floors are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of wonder through symbolism of renewal, but emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful, yet lacks deeper subtext or a lingering thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a celestial map aligning with greenhouse tears is inventive, metaphors like "canvas of life" feel somewhat generic; emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the map and greenhouse, but it lacks the depth to leave a profound lingering thought; style supports clarity yet doesn't elevate to exceptional literary heights.</comment>
