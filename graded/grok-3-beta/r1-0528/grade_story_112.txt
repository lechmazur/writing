<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and ties to the aimless traveler’s transformation, but the personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; reactions to the handkerchief and hopscotch feel surface-level rather than revealing nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from aimlessness to purpose is present but feels slightly rushed within the word limit; the hopscotch cipher as a plot device is intriguing but not fully integrated into a cohesive cause-effect chain, leaving minor logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the writing system archive is vividly rendered with sensory details like aged paper and falling snow, effectively enhancing the mournful tone and preservation theme; however, the timeframe’s impact feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a poignant sense of loss and rediscovery with strong imagery (snowflake melting, handkerchief as palimpsest), but the emotional depth is occasionally stated rather than shown; ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the hopscotch cipher offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “archive within him”) feel familiar; emotional resonance is present but not consistently nuanced, and the style occasionally leans toward overwritten prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style sometimes prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
