<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as a repressed poet with lingering doubts shapes his hesitant yet defiant actions, but his sudden shift to authority feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is vividly realized with sensory details like ivy-strangled lampposts and the scent of ozone, enhancing the mood, though the setting's connection to the bottle could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (skin as parchment) evoke thought, and the ending is purposeful, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh (bottle as forgotten tear), but others are overused (tombstone weight); the narrative avoids major clichés, yet Elias’s transformation lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity limits deeper resonance.</comment>
