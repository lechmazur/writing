<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s motivation to restore his family’s wealth through secret recipes is clear and aligns with his broke aristocrat status, but his personality lacks depth beyond desperation; his voice and reactions feel somewhat generic, missing nuanced individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with Silas’s revelation; cause and effect are logical, though the shift from material to spiritual legacy feels slightly abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting at twilight is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like damp earth and ghostly carnival music, enhancing the tone of blurry vividness and supporting Alistair’s quest, though the parallel paths concept feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on legacy and burden with a satisfying ending, and the glowing illustration serves as effective symbolism; however, the dialogue from Silas feels expository, and the central conflict resolves too neatly, lacking lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on legacy through botanical secrets, some descriptions (e.g., “blurry vividness”) feel forced, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing; overall style is distinct but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the haunted coaster and botanical illustration, and it leaves a lingering thought on legacy; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
