<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Father Aris's stage fright and self-doubt are well-integrated into his internal conflict as an exorcist, shaping his trembling hesitation; however, his sudden shift to decisive action feels slightly unearned, lacking deeper exploration of motivation within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the tight word limit, with the action of submergence driving the climax, but pacing feels rushed at the turning point, and the connection between the child’s play-bubble and the ritual resolution is somewhat forced, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like fogged visors and frozen metal, enhancing the desolate mood; yet, the integration of toy assembly as a timeframe feels underexplored and tonally inconsistent with the existential dread.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional tension through Aris’s raw courage and the entity’s menace, with strong symbolism in the wildflowers; however, the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central theme of overcoming “never” lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and spiritual exorcism, some metaphors (e.g., “spectral malignancy”) feel overwrought, and emotional resonance relies too heavily on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative use of the play-bubble as a ritual space, but the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
