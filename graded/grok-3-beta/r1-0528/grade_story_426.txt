<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve folk medicines is clear, but the secretive pathfinder trait feels underdeveloped in action; reactions to the teapot are symbolic but lack depth in revealing personality. Voice is indistinct, and the "angrily peaceful" attribute feels forced in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the connection between music playlists and ghostly disturbance is intriguing but underdeveloped. Pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and abrupt shifts that disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone and complements the ghostly disturbance concept; sensory details like the ghost train's whistle are evocative, but the connection between setting and object feels tangential and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some emotional resonance in the hug and preservation theme, with decent imagery (cracked teapot as fragility), but the conflict feels underdeveloped. Subtext is present but shallow; ending lacks lasting impact, and style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality in combining music playlists with botanical data is notable, but execution feels gimmicky; some metaphors (teapot fractures as trails) are fresh, while others are generic. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts unnaturally at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but feels stretched by the word limit rather than deliberately concise. Lingering impact is minimal, and style occasionally obscures clarity with overcomplex descriptions.</comment>
