<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Elara Vance's "brainy observer" trait is evident, but her emotional arc feels underdeveloped; her shift from weakness to strength lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution; the connection between the doll and civilization's message is logical but not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is vividly rendered with sensory detail and enhances the ethereal tone; however, the timeframe of faster-than-light travel feels tangential and underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic resonance through imagery and theme of impermanence, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition; subtext is present but not as layered as it could be.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of ephemeral art is original, some descriptions lean on generic poetic phrasing; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly formal prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
