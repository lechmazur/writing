<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The impassive deputy’s motivation to witness pure grace is clear, but his personality feels underexplored beyond stoicism; the personally impersonal trait is stated but not deeply shown through actions or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of stretching perception driving the narrative; however, the bee language method, while intriguing, feels slightly disconnected from logical cause-effect in a realistic framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lush orchard in a cathedral rafters is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like peaches and oil; the setting enhances the mood of cautious bravery and supports the motivation, though the timeframe of oil changes feels peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the moment of grace with the bee’s dance, and imagery like “desperate fingers” of roots is striking; however, the theme of uncharted echoes lacks deeper subtext, and the conflict is understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of bee language and cathedral orchard is original, with fresh metaphors, but the deputy’s emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on generic descriptors like “pure grace” without specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the bee dance and orchard setting, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels somewhat restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
