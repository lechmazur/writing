<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Sir Gareth's regret driving his actions, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond sorrow; lacks distinct voice or nuanced traits beyond the archetype of a grieving knight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the connection between objects and final choice lacks deeper grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like salt air and crashing waves, strongly supporting the tone of regret; setting enhances the isolation and mood, though some connections between objects and setting feel incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through memory and loss, with strong symbolism in the lighthouse and Lyra constellation; ending is purposeful, but subtext feels slightly heavy-handed, reducing depth of reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s, and metaphors like the lighthouse beam are evocative, but emotional handling occasionally states rather than shows; lacks a truly unique style or surprising twist, feeling somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with elements mostly in service of narrative, and brief length feels deliberate; however, style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and lingering impact is moderate, lacking profound depth.</comment>
