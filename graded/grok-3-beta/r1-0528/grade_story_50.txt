<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brother Ansel’s internal conflict as an unconvinced missionary is clear, but his motivation lacks depth beyond surface doubt; reactions to the fork and piano feel symbolic but not revelatory of unique personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the action of decoding patterns drives the story, but pacing is uneven with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect in the magical transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass desert is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (shimmering, humming), enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of the butterfly migration feels underutilized and disconnected from the core action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (fork, butterfly) create some emotional resonance, but the story leans on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a deeper, memorable impact or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of magic in a desert is intriguing, metaphors like “shifting sands” feel overused; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks a distinct, individual voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style supports clarity, but the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking lasting depth.</comment>
