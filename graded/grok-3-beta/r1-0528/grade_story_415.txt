<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arlo’s motivation to sever toxic ties through cooking is clear and drives his actions, but his personality feels somewhat underdeveloped beyond his struggle with his father’s criticism; the memory-tasting ability is intriguing but not fully explored in shaping his distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the act of appeasing Magnus driving the narrative, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the stadium setting’s connection to the core action is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Yodeling Valley is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the mood and supporting Arlo’s motivation, but the stadium timeframe feels incongruous with the intimate, personal conflict, diluting atmospheric consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the shared vulnerability at the climax and employs effective symbolism with the paperclip, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural rhythm; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the memory-tasting concept offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “valley mist”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies occasionally on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; the narrative avoids overt clichés but doesn’t fully escape predictable reconciliation tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration of memory-tasting and forgiveness, but the stadium setting hinders clarity and impact; it leaves a lingering feeling of resolution, though not profound depth, within the brief length.</comment>
