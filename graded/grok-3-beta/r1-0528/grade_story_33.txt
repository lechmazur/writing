<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias’s portrayal as a solitary birdwatcher is intriguing, and his anxiously relaxed state shapes a nuanced tension, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the depth of his internal conflict is hinted at but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the cosmic blink and reflections driving a surreal shift, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end lacks sharper causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The leaf classification office is vividly rendered with sensory details like the tang of preserved leaves, enhancing the braided bitterness, though the cosmic timeframe feels slightly disjointed from the grounded setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (mask as brokenness, reflections as memory) evoke emotional depth, and the theme of nonviolence is compelling, but the ending feels slightly underwhelming, lacking a final punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on inherited violence, some metaphors (e.g., “spectral forests”) feel overworked, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the mask and reflections, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
