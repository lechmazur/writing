<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s somnambulism and humility shape her actions uniquely, but her motivation to map spiritual wisdom feels slightly abstract and underexplored; her reactions lack deeper personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scouting action drives the plot, and the pilgrimage method fits, but the arc feels incomplete due to a rushed resolution; pacing is uneven with dense exposition slowing the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory and woodland setting create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the connection to "between flights" feels tangential and underutilized.</comment>
