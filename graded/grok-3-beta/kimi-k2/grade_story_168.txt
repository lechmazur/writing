<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a ruthless flower arranger feels underdeveloped; the ruthlessness is mentioned but not deeply explored in actions or consequences beyond a single confession, lacking a distinct voice or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of distinguishing glyphs driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and some causal links between revelations and actions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle is evocatively described with sensory details like dewy grass and mossy faces, enhancing the tone of polite anarchy and supporting the decoding motivation, though timeframe integration feels slightly repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity through subtext and imagery like stones as a bouquet, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and the central conflict of decoding lacks sharp tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like glyphs shimmering are fresh, the narrative leans on somewhat predictable mystical stone tropes without full subversion, and emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the comb and stone circle, leaving a lingering question about future explorations, but overly ornate language occasionally obscures clarity and impact.</comment>
