<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lark’s secretive nature and past as a forgotten prodigy are intriguing, but her motivations feel slightly inconsistent—running to escape fame while preserving folk medicines lacks deeper emotional grounding. Her voice is distinct but underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the marathon training framing a journey of return, but pacing feels uneven—key emotional beats are rushed, and the child’s introduction is abrupt, disrupting coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative, with sensory details like creaking carriages and fog enhancing mood. The atmosphere supports Lark’s aloof passion, though connections between setting and timeframe could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lark’s tears and the boy’s hug, with symbolism (teapot as memory) adding depth. However, the theme of returning to the world feels underexplored, and some emotional moments are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the playlist hacking offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “constellations like annotated leaves”) feel ornate and slightly forced. Emotional resonance is present but leans on explicit statements over nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the teapot and playlists, leaving a lingering question of redemption. However, the style occasionally overreaches with complexity, hindering clarity, and the brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
