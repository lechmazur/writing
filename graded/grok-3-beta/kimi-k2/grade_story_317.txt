<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a logical cause-effect progression, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the betrayal concept drives the narrative unevenly with repetitive focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting and timeframe are evocative and tied to the mood, with strong sensory details in the cave and dawn; however, the connection between telescope and setting feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild tension and has some symbolism with crystals and betrayal, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance; ending is purposeful but not particularly memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept but relies on repetitive phrasing around "betrayal" and lacks fresh metaphors; emotional portrayal feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style is occasionally overwrought, and depth beyond the explicit narrative is limited; length feels constraining rather than deliberate.</comment>
