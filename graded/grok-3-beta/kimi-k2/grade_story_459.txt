<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the connection between her job and ghostly encounters lacks depth, though her emotional arc with letting go shows promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the ghost tour stakeout and elevator shaft elements don’t fully drive the narrative, leaving some cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is evocatively described with sensory details like saline humidity, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the timeframe of lunch breaks feels underexplored and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mara’s release and uses strong imagery like the crumbling castles, but the central conflict feels understated; subtext is present but not fully layered, leaving the impact somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise, some metaphors (e.g., “silence pressed like glass”) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the tone wavers, risking predictability in ghostly tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the flower crown, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
