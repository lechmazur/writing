<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysandra's confusion as a diplomat is clear and shapes her internal conflict, but her motivations shift without enough grounding, making her reactions feel slightly inconsistent. Her voice is distinct but underdeveloped due to limited dialogue or personal perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from confusion to resolution via the treaty rewrite is present but feels rushed within the word limit. The action of liberalizing trade/return is logical but lacks deeper cause-effect connections, and pacing suffers from dense imagery over narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like glowing sodium walls and brine drips, enhancing the mood and complementing the joyfully tragic tone. However, the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (birds, salt, key) evoke emotion and subtext about memory and adaptation. The ending is purposeful, but the central conflict lacks sharpness. The theme of collective memory is clear, though emotional depth sometimes relies on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the story offers an original take on a subterranean village and migration, some metaphors (e.g., "blue wound") feel overused. Emotional resonance is present but not fully nuanced, and the style occasionally veers into purple prose, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the key and birds, leaving a lingering thought about memory and return. However, the dense style hinders clarity at times, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
