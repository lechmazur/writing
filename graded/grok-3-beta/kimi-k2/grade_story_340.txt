<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lúcia’s pride and motivation to outshine Aldo are clear, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped; reactions lack nuanced layers beyond surface defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the resolution; youthifying as an action drives the story, though logical coherence wavers with the bridge’s sudden recognition issue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The treehouse city setting is vividly realized with sensory details like vines and humidity, enhancing atmosphere, but the timeframe’s metaphorical “clock skipping” feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and dialogue (Juju’s quips) are engaging, and there’s subtext about legacy, but emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing in key moments like Aldo’s shadow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, some metaphors (e.g., “malicious dentists”) feel forced, and emotional resonance leans on explicit statements rather than subtle showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but pacing and depth issues prevent a lasting impact; style supports clarity yet lacks the polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
