<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysanderâ€™s portrayal as a broke aristocrat shapes his motivations effectively, with clear ties to legacy and debt, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; reactions to the illustration reveal little beyond surface-level desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of harmonizing driving a unique resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between ghostly encounters and the recipe discovery are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting and blurry vividness tone mesh well, enhanced by evocative sensory details like creaking metal and ghostly laughter; atmosphere strongly supports the legacy burden, though some connections to the orchid feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses potent imagery (orchids in ribcages), with subtext about redemption, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and conflict resolution lacks sharpness within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of gothic and botanical elements, some metaphors (time folding like paper) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering sense of sorrow and hope, but overly ornate language at times hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
