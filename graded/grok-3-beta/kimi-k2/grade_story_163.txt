<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amelia's background as a lost heiress is intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the transition from rejection of wealth to scientific pursuit lacks depth, and her voice, while distinct, leans on clich√© with the "bitterly optimistic" trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the spiral anomaly and cloud-visitor resolution feel rushed, undermining coherence; the fragmented reality concept drives the narrative, yet pacing stumbles at the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station and cloud migration timeframe create a vivid, unique atmosphere; sensory details of fractured skies and prismatic shards enhance immersion, though the setting's connection to the parking stub feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (parking stub as talisman, clouds as visitors) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is undercut by overt telling of grief; the ending is purposeful, yet the central theme of unified reality feels heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining xenobiology with personal grief, but metaphors like "lost thought" and "fractured sky" verge on overused; emotional handling shows nuance at times, though it occasionally states feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of reality's fluidity, though the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
