<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "ingeniously clueless" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to solve the riddle feels surface-level and lacks personal depth or backstory to anchor it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is cohesive with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, undermining emotional weight; cause and effect are logical but lack deeper stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with haunting sensory details like "moonlit wallpaper" and "skeletal spine," effectively enhancing the tone of quiet mania; setting and timeframe integrate well, though roller coaster track feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and has strong imagery (e.g., "corridor of moonlit wallpaper"), with subtext about questioning itself as the riddle; ending is purposeful but lacks a stronger emotional punch; theme is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept and imagery, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "bleeding orange flakes") feel slightly overworked; emotional resonance is present but not nuanced enough to feel truly human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the doorknob and riddle, leaving a lingering question about curiosity; however, style occasionally leans toward ornate over clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
