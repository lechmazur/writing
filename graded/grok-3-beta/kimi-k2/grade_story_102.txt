<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlen's spinelessness is evident in his hesitation and cowardice, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the internal conflict is stated rather than deeply explored, lacking nuanced depth in his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the action of unlocking the dollhouse, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper cause-effect grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly described with evocative sensory details (brass globes, cracked skylight), enhancing the tone of luminous doubt and supporting Arlen's hesitation, though the timeframe integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (dollhouse as past failure, maps as wings) evoke reflection, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying on telling over showing at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements and avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “bruised moons”) feel slightly overwrought, and emotional depth lacks subtle nuance, occasionally leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of the dollhouse and prophecy, leaving a lingering sense of mystery, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
