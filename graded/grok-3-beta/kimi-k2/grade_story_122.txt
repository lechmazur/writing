<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cyber-templar's motivation to defy heaven's script and reflect lightning back at the storm is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "patiently frantic" attribute; reactions to the bridle and prism are symbolic but not emotionally revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning (ritual), middle (prism calibration), and end (storm transformation), but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; cause and effect are logical, yet the proving action lacks concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and timeframe of "during reading" create a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone of euphoric agitation; sensory details like ash and light are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its symbolism of storms and safety, with strong imagery and subtext about mortality; however, the ending feels more dramatic than satisfying, and emotions are often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the cyber-templar and storm metaphor are original, some phrases feel ornate ("circuits singing hallelujah"); emotional resonance is present but leans on explicit descriptors, and the narrative occasionally follows predictable cyberpunk tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the lingering impact is strong but not profound.</comment>
