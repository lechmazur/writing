<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaede's portrayal as a remote herbalist is intriguing but lacks depth; her motivation to provoke unspoken conversation feels vague and her actions, while symbolic, don't fully reveal personal stakes or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels unevenâ€”meteor shower and corridor sequences rush key emotional beats, diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Japanese castle and atmospheric tone of distant intimacy are vividly realized with evocative sensory details like "paper walls glowed like moonlit snow," deeply enhancing mood and setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (violets, meteor showers) evokes reflection on memory and fate; however, the emotional resonance is undercut by a lack of clear conflict or tension beyond the ethereal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its poetic approach and subtle metaphors, but some imagery (e.g., "heart beating like a moth against paper") feels slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration of fate and memory; yet, the style occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
