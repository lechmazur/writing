<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel’s dry wit shapes his personality effectively, adding a layer of cynicism to his actions, but his motivations feel slightly underdeveloped—why he feels compelled to release the keeper remains vague beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the confiscation of the rope, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of the final dance’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom enhances the eerie tone and ties beautifully to the rope and promises, with vivid sensory details like salt-stained glass and fog, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (rope as binding promise) evoke emotion, and the ending is poignant, but dialogue feels sparse and lacks depth; subtext about love and duty is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like “cliff faces against the tide” are fresh, but some descriptions lean toward purple prose; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet the narrative occasionally follows predictable ghost story tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the tango, leaving a lingering melancholy, but overly ornate style slightly hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
