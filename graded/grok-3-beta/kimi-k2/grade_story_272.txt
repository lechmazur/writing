<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's social awkwardness and inventor background are implied but underdeveloped; her motivation to undo regret is clear but lacks depth in execution. Her interaction with the whistle reveals some inner conflict, but her voice and actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reaping metaphorically tied to regret, but the reversed trails method feels abstract and underexplained. Pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution; coherence is maintained but not seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The all-night diner and late shift timeframe create a fittingly melancholic atmosphere, enhanced by evocative details like sodium-lit parking lots. However, the encrypted message archive feels underutilized as a setting element, limiting its impact on the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood with strong symbolism (tree of regret, whistle), and the ending feels purposeful if slightly abrupt. Subtext about failure and renewal is present, but emotional depth is more stated than shown; central conflict is subtle but effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in its metaphoric approach, it leans on familiar tropes of regret and redemption without fully subverting them. Imagery is fresh at times but occasionally over ornate; emotional nuance is present but not consistently deep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the whistle and regret motif. However, the style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a strength. It leaves a lingering thought but lacks full resonance.</comment>
