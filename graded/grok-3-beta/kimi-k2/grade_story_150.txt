<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Calder's identity as an outlaw cowboy poet is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivations oscillate between anonymity and immortality without deep exploration of why, leaving his actions feeling somewhat unrooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains a coherent arc within the word limit, with the dice and changing texts driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution of Calder's choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is vividly realized with sensory details like brass gears and steam valves, enhancing the tone of saturated ambivalence, though the setting occasionally overshadows character depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (dice as destiny, dome as lifeâ€™s stage) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is uneven due to stated ambivalence rather than shown nuance; the ending is memorable yet slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining steampunk and cowboy elements, but some metaphors (lasso around throat) feel overused; emotional handling leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story coheres around its ambitious elements, with creative integration, but the brief length feels somewhat limiting; it leaves a lingering curiosity, though style occasionally verges on ornate, hindering clarity.</comment>
