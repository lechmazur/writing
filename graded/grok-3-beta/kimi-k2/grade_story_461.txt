<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calder Voss's irate nature as an explorer is well-integrated into his actions and dialogue, with a distinct voice in his bitter, cracked tone; however, his sudden shift to vulnerability feels slightly under-explored given the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot arc from rage to reconciliation is clear and complete within the tight word count, with effective pacing, though the magical elements (like the mirror) introduce a slight abruptness that could be smoothed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The witch's spellbook study and childhood bedroom timeframe blend hauntingly, with vivid sensory details like dust motes and moonlight daggers enhancing the atmosphere; minor disconnect in setting consistency as the room dissolves too suddenly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact through subtext and symbolism (dragonfly pendant as weapon-turned-compass), with a satisfying ending; dialogue feels natural but sparse, and some 'telling' over 'showing' in emotional resolution slightly dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors (paper dragon, pollen memories) and a unique take on generational healing stand out, but occasional ornate phrasing borders on purple prose, and the magical resolution feels a tad trope-heavy without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration and a lingering emotional resonance; style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels slightly constrained rather than fully deliberate.</comment>
