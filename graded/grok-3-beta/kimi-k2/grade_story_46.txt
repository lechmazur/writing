<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's blank-faced nature is intriguing and ties to emotional suppression, but motivation feels somewhat abstract; the personal conflict of dreaming is introduced late and lacks depth in development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a clear resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect of dream approval/rejection are logical, yet the personal transformation lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting of giant ferns and waterfalls is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing the mystical tone; atmosphere supports the guardian role, though connection to personal longing feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through dream symbolism and duty's burden; imagery is striking, but emotional resonance is diluted by telling over showing in key moments; ending is poignant yet slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in dream language and guardian concept, with fresh metaphors; however, some phrases feel ornate, and emotional nuance is inconsistently shown, hinting at occasional formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering question about sacrifice; style is evocative but occasionally overcomplex, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
