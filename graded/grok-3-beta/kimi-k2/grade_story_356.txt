<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s wryness and aloof warmth are evident, shaping a distinct voice, but her motivation to escape time feels underdeveloped and her reaction to the chalk lacks deeper personal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The spiral drawing and vanishing action drive the plot, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the arc is present but lacks a fully satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like time as a siren are fresh, but some phrases verge on purple prose; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative element use, but style occasionally overshadows clarity; it lingers somewhat, though depth feels constrained by overwrought language.</comment>
