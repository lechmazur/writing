<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the wine tasting, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; coherence is maintained, though the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Viking longhouse setting and overlooked era timeframe blend seamlessly, with vivid sensory details like candlelight and frost enhancing atmosphere; the tone of fierce repose supports the mood, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
