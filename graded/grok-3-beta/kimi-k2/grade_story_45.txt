<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to hush guilt is clear, but her transformation from curator to composer feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit; her personality lacks distinct depth beyond the guilt narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the museum crash; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating museum and jungle temple create a striking, surreal atmosphere with evocative imagery, though sensory details are inconsistently specific; the dull radiance tone complements the guilt motif effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lilaâ€™s guilt-to-purpose arc and offers subtext on creation vs. preservation, but the ending feels slightly overwrought; imagery is strong, yet some metaphors lack precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story shows originality in combining surreal elements, certain metaphors feel generic, and emotional resonance relies at times on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; tone remains mostly consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration, but style occasionally veers into over-elaboration; it leaves a lingering thought on transformation, though not sharply defined.</comment>
