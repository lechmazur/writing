<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to outrun the prophecy is clear, but the "unsettled" trait feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice beyond situational reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at key moments, and cause-effect links between reversed wishes and outcomes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details like "salt light" and "cedar and old rain," effectively enhancing the eerie tone and setting, though the drowned hotel connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (shell as prophecy, reversed wishes) add depth, and the ending is satisfying, but emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; conflict resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors like "hourglass conceding defeat" are fresh, but others are overly ornate; narrative tone is consistent, yet lacks a truly unique voice, and emotional resonance relies on description over subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with florid language, diminishing clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly memorable.</comment>
