<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of mercy over murder is intriguing, but the assassin's internal transformation lacks depth and feels abrupt; her distinct voice is present in the narrative style but not fully fleshed out through actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present but not strongly logical, with some cause-effect relationships vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the baroque asteroid is vivid and immersive with strong sensory details like "borrowed starlight" and "cracked quartz," enhancing the atmosphere; tone complements the concept effectively, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a contemplative response with strong imagery and symbolism (spider's web, dawn), but the ending lacks full satisfaction; subtext is present but not deeply layered, and conflict resolution feels slightly underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on purple prose ("cold perfume," "superficially profound prophecy"); emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering mood, but overly ornate style occasionally hinders clarity; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
