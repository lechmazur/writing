<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet’s character is distinct, with insomnia subtly influencing her late-night attic musings, and her motivation to discover non-violence feels earnest but underdeveloped; her reactions to the botanical samples reveal introspection, though her voice lacks sharper individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from obsession to realization is present but feels slightly forced within the word limit; the action of eliminating violence drives the story, yet pacing is uneven with rushed introspection at the end, and coherence is occasionally disrupted by metaphorical density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting enhances the eerie, introspective tone effectively, with moonlight and creaking boards creating vivid atmosphere; sensory details are strong, though the connection between setting and botanical samples could be more integral to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its exploration of violence and healing, with strong use of metaphor (botanical samples as teachers); however, the ending feels somewhat pat, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural edge; the theme of non-violence is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors like “subway stops of thought” are fresh, some imagery (e.g., “white moths”) feels overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable introspection, lacking a truly unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brevity feels intentional; however, the style’s heavy reliance on metaphor sometimes obscures clarity, and the lingering impact, while present, lacks the depth for a top-tier publication.</comment>
