<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysandra’s measured demeanor as a diplomat shapes her deliberate actions, but her inner turmoil feels underexplored; motivation is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven with rushed revelations; logical flow is present, though the genetic decoding pivot feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten city hall and drum circles create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like musty scents; however, the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response with themes of sacrifice over revenge, and symbolism (mirror, tassel) adds depth; yet, the ending lacks full emotional resonance and feels too abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique genetic twist, some imagery (e.g., “storm inside her”) feels generic; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally states rather than shows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
