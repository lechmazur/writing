<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The weatherbeaten knight's regret and inner conflict are evident, but his personality lacks depth beyond the trope of a haunted warrior. Motivation is clear but predictable, and his actions align with remorse, yet his voice and reactions feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of appreciating past choices driving the narrative. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the mirrored reflection concept introduces some logical ambiguity that disrupts coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere that enhances the tone of regret. Sensory details like crashing waves are effective, though the connection between setting and objects feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the knight's regret, and symbolism with the objects is strong. However, the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful, and the theme of redemption lacks nuanced exploration beyond surface-level remorse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the haunted knight trope feels familiar without subversion. Metaphors are evocative but occasionally overdone, and emotional resonance relies more on stated regret than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with the assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext.</comment>
