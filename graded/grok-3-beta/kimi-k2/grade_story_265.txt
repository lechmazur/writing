<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Mara’s impassivity and motivation to witness grace are clear, but her inner conflict or growth feels surface-level, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the twist tie.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between oil changes and the orchard’s vitality is intriguing but underdeveloped, leaving cause-effect relationships vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting of the cathedral orchard is vividly realized with strong sensory detail, enhancing the tone of cautious bravery and supporting the concept of grace, though the timeframe of oil changes feels slightly disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Storytelling is impactful with rich imagery and subtext (bees as grace, twist tie as covenant), evoking thought, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the central conflict remains understated for the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the surreal combination of elements, with fresh metaphors like “liquid scripture,” but some sensory details feel generic, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about grace, but stylistic complexity occasionally hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
