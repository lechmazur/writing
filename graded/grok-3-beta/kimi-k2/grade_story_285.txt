<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hesitant swordsman’s awkwardness is portrayed consistently, but his deeper motivations and emotional complexity remain underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the postcard beyond fulfilling a duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the emergence of crabs driving a symbolic resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the grandmother’s wish and the crabs’ actions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a striking, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details like steam and clicking shells; however, the setting’s connection to the swordsman’s motivation feels slightly forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its metaphor of migration and tradition, with strong imagery and a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance beyond the surface theme, relying more on telling than showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining hermit crabs with tradition, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., steam as ghosts) feel generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuanced depth, leaning on stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively with creative intent, leaving a lingering thought about tradition’s evolution, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and emotional impact.</comment>
