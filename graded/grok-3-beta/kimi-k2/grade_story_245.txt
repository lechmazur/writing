<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the smuggler’s rage and grief driving his actions, tied effectively to the sister’s disappearance. However, the irate nature feels slightly one-dimensional, lacking deeper nuance or internal conflict beyond anger and loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing is uneven; the discovery of the waterfall feels rushed compared to the heavy focus on memory and emotion, disrupting narrative balance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and vacuum-cold dawn create a stark, evocative atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like frost-cracking boots and mist. However, the setting’s connection to the hidden waterfalls feels slightly contrived, lessening total immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (chopstick as marker, waterfall as memory) evoke emotion and subtext, but the ending lacks a sharper punch. The central conflict is present but resolved too neatly, missing deeper tension or lingering questions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While imagery is often fresh, some metaphors (e.g., “frozen tongue”) feel overworked, and emotional expression occasionally leans toward telling over showing. The narrative avoids clichés but lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels intentional, but overly dense prose sometimes hinders clarity. It leaves a lingering feeling of loss, though not enough depth to stand out in a competitive market.</comment>
