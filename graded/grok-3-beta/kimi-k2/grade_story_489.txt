<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's "aggressively kind" attribute shapes its actions, but motivation feels vague and lacks depth; reactions to the whistle and lighthouse are evocative yet lack personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the whistleâ€™s action driving a subtle resolution; however, pacing feels uneven, with rushed transitions between observer and dancer disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room and timeframe are vividly realized with sensory details (salt, dust, whale calls) that enhance mood; atmosphere strongly supports the theme, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (whistle as tradition, whale calls as memory) evoke emotion and subtext; ending is satisfying, but lack of clear central conflict and over-reliance on telling over showing dampen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like "silver wire" are fresh, some descriptors feel ornate and veer into purple prose; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown; overall style shows individuality but risks predictability in trope use.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of tradition; however, overly complex language sometimes hinders clarity, and brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
