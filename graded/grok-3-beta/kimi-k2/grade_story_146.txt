<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to study sacred development is clear, but the faux fortune teller's internal conflict and "peaceful anger" feel underdeveloped and inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; transitions between visions and actions are sometimes abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like dust as pollen and rooftop gardens, effectively supporting the tone of peaceful anger and the extinct language archive setting; however, some connections between setting and action feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a reflective response with themes of language revival and legacy, supported by strong imagery and symbolism; yet, the ending feels slightly unresolved, and emotional depth is sometimes told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of an extinct language reviving through music and seeds, but some metaphors (e.g., city as crypt) are overused, and emotional portrayal occasionally lacks nuanced subtext, feeling stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the bone flute and sacred development, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped character depth prevent a fully lingering impact or clarity of style.</comment>
