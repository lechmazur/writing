<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a loyal scout is clear, tied to protecting meditation secrets, but the personality lacks depth or distinct voice beyond the role; actions align with duty but feel somewhat mechanical without nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with meditation as a resolution, but pacing feels unevenâ€”early buildup is dense while the ending rushes; causal links are present but not always compelling or fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the moth observation tower is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing the atmosphere of sanctified dread; the flickering city lights complement the tone, though some connections between setting and character motivation feel slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection through moths as metaphors for presence, with strong imagery and subtext about enlightenment; however, the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a visceral emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique blending of moths and meditation, with fresh metaphors, but some phrasing (e.g., "individually common") feels repetitive and overly ornate, verging on purple prose; emotional nuance is attempted but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about balance and transcendence; however, the style occasionally hinders clarity with overwrought language, and the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
