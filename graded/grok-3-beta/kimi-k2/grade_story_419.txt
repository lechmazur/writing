<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's empathic nature and blacksmith background are evident and shape actions, but motivation feels slightly abstract; lacks deeper personal stakes or backstory to ground the no-nonsense trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the middle lingers on imagery over action, and cause-effect links between heartbeat sync and house response are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting of the haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is vividly realized with strong sensory detail, enhancing tone and action; however, timeframe integration feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through imagery and theme of preserved humanity, with effective metaphors; yet, ending lacks sharp impact, and conflict resolution feels more poetic than concrete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept and imagery, avoiding clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “lanterns, not cages”) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but stated rather than deeply shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought of humanity’s persistence; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
