<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious nature is intriguing, but his motivation to coax life from barren ground feels underexplored and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the comet and planting driving events, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details like frost steaming on the beard; the tone aligns well with the concept of wilderness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (weathervane, petals) and a satisfying ending elevate impact, though emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh and avoids clich√©s, but the narrative leans on ornate language at times, risking purple prose, and emotional nuance feels slightly stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the weathervane's angle, though style occasionally overshadows clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks deeper provocation.</comment>
