<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the morbid floristâ€™s neutrality and passion are intriguing, but her motivation feels surface-level, with little exploration of inner conflict or backstory beyond thematic musings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the cosmic cycle concept drives the narrative, yet transitions between introspection and action are occasionally abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like the creaking dojo and violet dusk, enhancing the mood of impermanence; the floating rock dojo complements the cosmic theme exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling craft shows strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., darkness as a black chrysanthemum), with a clear theme of cycles, but emotional impact is muted by overly intellectualized reflections rather than visceral showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique setting and concept integration, but some metaphors feel ornate and verge on purple prose; emotional nuance exists but occasionally slips into stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative element integration and a lingering thematic resonance about cycles, but stylistic flourishes sometimes hinder clarity, and emotional depth falls short of top-tier expectations.</comment>
