<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to shame and maternal memory is compelling, but the sleep-deprived inventor lacks distinct personality beyond exhaustion; actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from despair to release is clear within word limit, but pacing feels rushed at climax; logical flow is strained by abstract connections between DNA and orchard animation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Neon orchard and cyberpunk underworld create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory detail; tone of passionate subtlety enhances emotional depth, though setting occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism (orchard as regret, light as release) evoke emotional resonance; subtext of shame and redemption is powerful, though ending feels slightly overwrought, lessening impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in metaphor and concept integration, avoiding clich√©s, but some phrases (e.g., "luminous regret") verge on purple prose; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering emotional effect; however, overly ornate style sometimes hinders clarity, and brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
