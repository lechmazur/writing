<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Juno's feistiness and intellectual playfulness are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve equine care is clear but lacks deeper emotional grounding or conflict to reveal her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the morphing lamp driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect logic of the magical transformation lacks grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The space debris studio and futuristic timeframe are evocatively paired, with strong sensory details like "vacuum and starlight" enhancing atmosphere; however, the tone occasionally wavers, undermining the quietly bold intent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional resonance through Juno’s stubborn hope and the lamp’s symbolism, but the ending feels slightly predictable; subtext is present but not deeply layered, and tension resolves too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a space stablehand is original, some metaphors like "comet tails" feel generic; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, but the narrative occasionally leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length suits the focused arc; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate imagery.</comment>
