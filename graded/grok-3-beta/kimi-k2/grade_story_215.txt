<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development of Sister Marisol is intriguing with the tension between her exorcist and scientist identities, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper emotional stakes or backstory to fully anchor her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is creative with puzzles driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the resolution, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying closure to the central conflict within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lesson timeframe create a unique, evocative atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the rosary clacking and phosphorescent ichor, though some setting elements feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling craft shines with strong imagery and subtext about faith and science, but emotional impact is somewhat muted by limited character depth, and the ending, while memorable, doesn’t fully resonate emotionally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality with its blend of dance, science, and spirituality, avoiding overt clichés, though some metaphors (e.g., “sweat baptized the floor”) feel slightly overdone, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about synthesizing belief and proof, but it falls short of flawless execution due to pacing and depth issues within the brief length.</comment>
