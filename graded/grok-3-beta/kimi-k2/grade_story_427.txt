<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lysander’s motivation to restore equilibrium and become a dream-weaver is intriguing, but his character lacks depth beyond the mechanical arm and trauma; reactions feel more symbolic than personal, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with deconstructing the boundary driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between sock and resolution are more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse and sea create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like salt and applause; tone complements the desperation, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (sock as memory, lighthouse as boundary) evoke emotion and subtext about grief and dreaming, but the ending feels overly neat, and conflict resolution lacks lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in its surreal approach, with fresh metaphors like “applause was the ocean clapping for the moon,” but some language verges on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration, but style sometimes obscures clarity; the brief length feels deliberate yet limits emotional depth, leaving a lingering thought that lacks full impact.</comment>
