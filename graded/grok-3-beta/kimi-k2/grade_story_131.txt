<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lila's aloofness and orphan status are well-integrated into her motivations and actions, shaping her detached yet poignant connection to the stones and ticket; however, her internal transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper exploration of her voice or backstory within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc from grief to courage, driven by the act of loosening; pacing is generally effective, though the gravitational shifts occasionally disrupt logical flow, feeling more symbolic than grounded in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garage with gravitational anomaly is vividly realized, enhancing the surreal atmosphere and complementing the theme of weight and release; sensory details like "invisible syrup" and "warped concrete" immerse effectively, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lila’s quiet release of fear, with strong imagery like orbiting stones and a satisfying ending; symbolism and subtext around courage are clear, though the central conflict feels understated and some emotional depth is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its surreal gravity concept and personal transformation, with fresh metaphors like "tiny planet" stones; however, some emotional descriptors lean generic, and the lottery ticket resolution borders on cliché without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends assigned elements into a meaningful whole, with creative interplay between gravity and courage; the brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering reflection on letting go, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
