<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the pickpocket's shift from thief to keeper, but motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks grounded specificity; the 'baffled' trait is underutilized in shaping distinct reactions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overly dense poetic interludes disrupting narrative flow; cause and effect between transformation and action are not fully clear or logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere in the haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with sensory details like rust and steam, effectively supporting the tone of scorching poise and enhancing the transformation concept; setting-object connection is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes thought through symbolism of light and poetry, with a memorable perspective on transformation; however, the ending feels slightly overwrought, and dialogue from the dummy, while purposeful, borders on contrived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique blend of elements, but some metaphors (e.g., "darkness inside out") feel overused; emotional resonance leans on stated transformation rather than nuanced showing, and style occasionally slips into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering idea of rewriting one's shadow; however, overly complex language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
