<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric’s cold nature and rebellious streak are evident in his actions, but his motivations lack deeper exploration; the shift to mercy feels abrupt without sufficient internal conflict or backstory to ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and resolution, but the connection between collecting remedies and building altars feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The deserted intersection late at night complements the tone of quiet rebellion, and sensory details like neon buzz and frosted breath enhance immersion; however, the secret agent center feels underexplored as a setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through altars and loss, with strong imagery like “heart-shaped shadow”; yet, the artistic awakening theme feels underdeveloped, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors like “mittens taught his heart to knit” are fresh, others are overused (“breath frosting like glass”); emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
