<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal tragedy is clear, and the vigilant orchardist's actions align with a quest for justice, but the personality lacks depth beyond the sardonic edge; reactions to the letter seal feel symbolic yet underexplored for emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by unraveling conspiracies, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; some logical connections (e.g., hacking via ventilation cycles) are rushed and strain coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the paper airplane test facility enhances the conspiracy theme and action, with the peacock mural adding atmospheric intrigue; sensory details are present but sparse, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and mild emotional response through the justice theme, with effective symbolism in the peacock mural; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality in combining elements like the mural and letter seal shows ingenuity, but some metaphors (e.g., "fan of receipts") feel slightly forced; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate; however, clarity is occasionally hindered by overly ornate language, and lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
