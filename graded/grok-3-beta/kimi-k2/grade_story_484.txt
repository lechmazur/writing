<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to embody values is intriguing but underdeveloped; the brewer's grogginess shapes initial actions, but personality lacks depth and distinct voice beyond situational reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; cause and effect are logical, yet the protest's integration into the narrative feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted mansion graveyard setting is evocatively described with sensory details like "malted regret," enhancing atmosphere; tone of flippant solemnity complements setting, though some details feel overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (mirror shard, kettle) adds depth; ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is uneven due to inconsistent showing versus telling of the brewer's transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining brewing with darkness as a product, but metaphors like "encroaching darkness" feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully resonant due to stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration; style supports clarity, but brevity sometimes limits depth; leaves a lingering idea of shared values, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
