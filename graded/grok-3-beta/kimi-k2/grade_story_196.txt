<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tired swordsman’s apathy and hidden promise are well-defined, shaping his internal conflict, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt within the word limit; motivation is clear but lacks deeper nuance in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the swordsman’s decision to follow the meteor showers, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between resignation and action are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery and quiet breakroom create a unique, evocative atmosphere that supports the tone of isolation; sensory details are present but could be sharper to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the swordsman’s realization, with effective symbolism in the meteor showers, but the ending feels more contemplative than impactful; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of following meteor showers is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., “dying moth”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, but the overall style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a deliberate brevity that suits its introspective nature, but it lacks a lingering depth or question; creative use of elements is evident, though not fully maximized for impact.</comment>
