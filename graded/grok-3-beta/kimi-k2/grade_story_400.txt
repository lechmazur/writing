<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's ambivalence is clear and shapes actions, but motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the druid's inner conflict lacks deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven; the gathering action drives the story, yet some symbolic moments slow momentum unnecessarily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of isolation; the glacial orchard and crevasse are integral to atmosphere, though timeframe integration feels slightly peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery, with a poignant ending; emotional resonance is present, but some symbolism (e.g., safety pin) feels heavy-handed, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, avoiding clich√©s, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, slightly detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; lingering emotional impact is present, though not fully piercing due to minor over-symbolism.</comment>
