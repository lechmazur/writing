<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rowan’s hopeful and cleverly naive nature shapes his quest to heal brokenness, and his motivation to reclaim lost moments is clear, though his inner conflict and voice could be more distinctly textured beyond symbolic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from entering the maze to transforming the Regret Engine is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration of the neutralizing action’s stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden within the hedge maze is vividly realized with sensory details like silver apples chiming and honey-rust air, powerfully enhancing the tone of agonizing bliss and Rowan’s motivation, though timeframe integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (jigsaw edge as hope, Regret Engine as sorrow) evoke emotional depth, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict’s resolution lacks a final visceral punch; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining the jigsaw edge with cryptic frequencies, avoiding most clichés through fresh metaphors, though some emotional descriptions (e.g., grief in 3/4 time) verge on ornate without deeper grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates assigned elements into a lingering narrative of healing, with creative flair in execution, though style occasionally prioritizes poetic flourish over raw emotional clarity, slightly hindering impact.</comment>
