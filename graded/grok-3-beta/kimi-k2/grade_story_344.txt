<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters Mara and Lin are distinct, with Mara’s claustrophobia and motivation to study human behavior well-integrated into her actions; however, Lin’s "lightly heavyhearted" attribute feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping her dialogue or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a subtle arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly uneven, with the tremor event underdeveloped as a climactic moment; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are occasionally thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like glowing lanterns and groaning rock, enhancing the quietly bold tone and Mara’s internal conflict; however, the timeframe "improbable beginnings" feels more decorative than integral to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through Mara’s vulnerability and the healing touch, with effective imagery like "warmth spread like sunrise"; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme of improbable beginnings could be woven more consistently into subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like old jam recipes with emotional mapping, avoiding clichés; however, some metaphors (e.g., "fear no longer a cage but a compass") verge on overused, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on explicit statements rather than pure showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration of concepts like healing touch and human behavior study; yet, the style occasionally leans ornate, slightly hindering clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
