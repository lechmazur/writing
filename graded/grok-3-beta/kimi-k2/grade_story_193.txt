<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (curing loneliness) is clear and drives the prince’s actions, but development feels slightly surface-level; his personality lacks distinct depth beyond the trope of an exiled royal, and reactions to the mortar and pestle are evocative but not uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (exile), middle (discovery), and end (connection), but pacing feels uneven; the sudden shift to the woman’s appearance lacks setup, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details (snow, cinnamon, childhood laughter) enhancing mood; the abandoned customs office complements the theme of lost connections, though its integration with the timeframe feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through loneliness and connection, with strong symbolism (mortar as healing tool); ending is purposeful, but subtext is somewhat obvious, and the central conflict of loneliness resolves too neatly, lacking lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the metaphor of grinding memories, but reliance on familiar exiled-royal and magical-object tropes without subversion feels predictable; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, yet lacks a truly unique voice or style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, style occasionally overreaches into ornate language, and depth beyond the explicit narrative is present but not profoundly lingering.</comment>
