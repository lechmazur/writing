<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scribe’s uptight nature is evident in his initial intent to catalogue heresy, but his emotional transformation feels somewhat abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual progression. Motivation is clear, yet his distinct voice is underdeveloped in the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the transformation driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the emotional pivot. Cause and effect are logical, though the connection between adhesive analysis and runes feels forced and under-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The witch’s greenhouse on a hill of gravestones is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (sweating glass, humming bulb), enhancing the mood of buried optimism. The setting strongly supports the transformation concept, though the timeframe’s impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the scribe’s memory of his mother, and imagery (vines, bulb as heart) is striking. However, the central conflict of empathy versus steel feels underdeveloped, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements (Tesla’s bulb, runes), some metaphors (arms of steel) lean toward cliché without subversion. Emotional handling shows nuance in places, but explicit statements like “tears threatened” detract from showing. Overall style is distinct but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the bulb and greenhouse. However, the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth. It leaves a lingering feeling, but style occasionally hinders clarity with overwrought phrasing.</comment>
