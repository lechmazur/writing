<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the fighter’s struggle against self-deception, but the internal conflict lacks deeper nuance; reactions to the shard are evocative yet feel slightly overwrought, missing subtle layers in personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves a sense of resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—early introspection drags while the climax rushes; logical flow is mostly maintained, though some symbolic transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with evocative sensory details of the dusty attic and clockwork animals, enhancing the surreal tone; setting supports the mood well, though connection to sculptor’s timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the fighter’s confrontation with past shame, and symbolism (shard, child) adds depth; however, the ending feels overly neat, lacking lingering tension or ambiguity for reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors are fresh in places (e.g., “bruises bloom… purple maps”), but some phrases verge on purple prose; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of themes; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
