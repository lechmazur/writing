<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias Finch’s amiable nature is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams is clear but lacks depth in execution, feeling more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between crossword-solving and lighthouse activation are intriguing yet not fully logical or seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly realized with strong sensory details (cold brass, vibrating timbers), enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced, lessening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective use of imagery (shadows as spilled ink, dawn bleeding lavender) and symbolism (crossword as treaty) creates impact, but emotional resonance is muted by Elias’s underdeveloped personal stakes; the ending is satisfying yet not deeply memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique fusion of myth and technology, some metaphors (trapped moth, shared light) feel slightly overused; tone is consistent, but emotional depth relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of lighthouse and crossword; however, style occasionally veers into ornate language, slightly hindering clarity, and depth beyond the narrative is present but not striking.</comment>
