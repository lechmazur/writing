<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wizard's ethereal nature and motivation to chase aurora patterns are intriguing, but her personality lacks depth beyond symbolic longing; motivation feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between actions and cosmic disclaimers are conceptually interesting yet occasionally forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive and aurora patterns create a vivid, surreal atmosphere; sensory details like glitching skies are evocative, though some elements (e.g., alien frequencies) feel underexplored in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., teddy bear as memory anchor) evoke emotion, and the ending is satisfying; however, the central theme of compassion feels heavy-handed at times, lacking subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and emotional resonance, some metaphors (e.g., "quiet supernova") feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not as sharply as it could.</comment>
