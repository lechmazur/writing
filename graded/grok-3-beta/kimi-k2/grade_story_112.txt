<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and drives actions, but the "aimless traveler" trait feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in personal history or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a sense of purpose, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between hopscotch patterns and recipes are intriguing yet not fully coherent or logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting of the writing system archive is vivid and enhances atmosphere with evocative sensory details like dust and cedar; snowflake imagery complements mournful tone beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (handkerchief as memory, hopscotch as recipe) evokes emotional resonance and subtext, though ending feels slightly overwrought, diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh and specific (e.g., "smoke rose in slow calligraphy"), avoiding clich√©s, but some ornate language borders on purple prose, slightly detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering emotional note, but overly elaborate style occasionally hinders clarity and immediate publishability.</comment>
