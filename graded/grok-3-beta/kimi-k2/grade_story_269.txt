<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to transcend mortal limits is clear and drives the narrative, but the tailor's personality feels underdeveloped beyond nostalgia and desperation; dialogue reveals inner conflict but lacks a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and transformative end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and cause-effect links between confessions and mirror's response are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk observation deck and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of hopeful desperation; sensory details like grinding gears and ozone are effective, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on identity and transformation through strong symbolism (mirror, sewing); ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is somewhat diminished by over-telling rather than showing nuanced feelings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in blending tailor metaphor with parallel lives, but reliance on familiar steampunk tropes and predictable transformation narrative dulls uniqueness; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often ornate, verging on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like mirror and confessions, leaving a lingering idea of transformation; however, style sometimes prioritizes complexity over clarity, and brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
