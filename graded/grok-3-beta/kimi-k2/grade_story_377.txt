<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, with a logical progression from longing to integration to release, but pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions that undermine emotional weight at key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret society library and block party setting create a vivid contrast, enhanced by sensory details like kettle corn smoke and ozone, though the atmosphere occasionally feels disjointed from Cache’s internal journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic reflection on memory and release, with effective symbolism in the barometer, but the emotional impact is diluted by overly explicit metaphors and a lack of nuanced subtext at the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a sentient game character is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar tropes of digital beings yearning for reality without sufficient subversion; metaphors like “ghost of polygons” feel slightly overused.</comment>
