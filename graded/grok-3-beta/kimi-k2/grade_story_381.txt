<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and tied to mapping caves for personal and cultural preservation, but the hushed necromancer's personality lacks depth beyond the nostalgic connection to her grandfather; her voice feels indistinct despite the unique premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on imagery, while key actions like merging consciousness with the cave lack detailed grounding, causing minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like refracted light and pulsing walls, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone; however, the setting’s integration with the timeframe "between sets" feels underutilized and vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the theme of preserving memory and offers satisfying subtext about rebellion against digital sterility, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and the conflict of preservation versus loss is underdeveloped within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates originality in combining necromancy with geological resonance and futuristic nostalgia, but some imagery (e.g., "sound of resolve") feels repetitive and slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering emotional impact of memory preservation; however, style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
