<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with the seamstress's timid nature evolving into certainty, but her motivation feels slightly idealized and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but the pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolutions and some cause-effect links (e.g., scoreboard mechanics) left vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting of the reimagined temple and arcade is evocative with strong sensory details (dust motes, machine oil), effectively supporting the mood, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is notable with rich symbolism (ribbon as healing) and a satisfying ending, but emotional resonance is occasionally undermined by overt telling rather than showing, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is mixed; metaphors like "constellations of thread" are fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable healing tropes without subversion, and some imagery feels ornate rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative integration of elements and leaves a lingering feeling, but cohesion is hampered by uneven pacing and overly elaborate style that sometimes obscures clarity.</comment>
