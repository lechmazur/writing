<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fading caretaker's portrayal is intriguing, with a distinct blend of weariness and obsession, but the motivation to pursue the forbidden feels underdeveloped and lacks consistent grounding in personal history or stakes beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of gorging on forbidden light driving a surreal transformation, but the pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and the cause-effect logic of the terminal’s role in the resolution is murky.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid, with the desolate caravan repair station and receding waves creating a haunting backdrop; sensory details like lavender scent and wet sand are evocative, though the setting’s connection to character motivation feels more decorative than integral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic, reflective mood through strong imagery and metaphor, like the caretaker becoming a map; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and while subtext exists, the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the brief scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its surreal transformation and imagery, with fresh metaphors like “liquid constellations,” but some phrases verge on purple prose, and emotional resonance leans on stated abstractions rather than nuanced, shown reactions, risking formulaic overreach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the forbidden and lavender, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with ornate language; it leaves a lingering surreal impression, though depth feels more stylistic than substantive.</comment>
