<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Axel’s spirited nature and lumberjack identity are evident, but his motivations shift unevenly between personal healing and broader restoration without deep internal conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven; the coded letter and nightmares drive the story, yet connections between personal and global stakes are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of harsh tenderness; sensory details like pine and grease are strong, though some atmospheric elements feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (forest grief, bike as weapon) create impact, but emotional resonance is inconsistent; the ending satisfies yet lacks deeper subtext to fully elevate the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows creative intent, metaphors occasionally feel overworked; emotional handling leans on explicitness rather than nuanced showing at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; it lingers somewhat, though not profoundly, due to uneven depth.</comment>
