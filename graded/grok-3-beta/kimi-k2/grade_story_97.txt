<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The oracle's fact-minded nature and desperate casualness are intriguing but inconsistently developed; her shift to empathy feels abrupt without deeper internal conflict shown through actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action of recomposing, but pacing feels rushed with visions piling up without enough grounding; coherence is maintained, though cause and effect are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly described with evocative sensory details like gravity's manners and colors arguing with shapes; however, the atmosphere's connection to the timeframe "whispered minute" feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through vivid heartbreak visions and employs strong imagery (e.g., grief carving constellations); yet, the central conflict lacks sharp resolution, and the theme of empathy, while present, feels slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh (e.g., streets folding like paper cranes), others are overused (e.g., compass needle drunk on sorrow); emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering emotional impact; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity over depth.</comment>
