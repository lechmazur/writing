<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finch's motivation to master time is clear and aligns with his polite, humble demeanor, but his inner conflict lacks deeper exploration within the word limit; his silence is impactful yet underexplained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete with a clear beginning and end, but pacing is uneven—key moments like the betrayal feel rushed, disrupting coherence within the tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The electronic wilderness refuge is vividly realized with sensory details like copper vines and fiber-optic roots; atmosphere supports the tone of proud humility, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor (e.g., "déjà vu spelled backwards") are striking, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional depth is more told than shown, limiting impact; central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a polite bandit and electronic refuge offers originality, some metaphors feel slightly overused ("dying candles"); emotional resonance is attempted but lacks nuanced showing over stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
