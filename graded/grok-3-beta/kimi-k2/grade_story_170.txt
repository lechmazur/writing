<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila’s free-spirited herbalist nature is evident in her gentle approach to coral restoration, and her motivation to overcome shame is clear, but her academically artistic trait feels underexplored in action, lacking depth in how it shapes her beyond the thesis mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with memorizing letters driving emotional resolution effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the abandoned wall’s significance remains vague, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The coral restoration station is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (turquoise tanks, rose-gold dawn), enhancing the mood of longing and renewal; the atmosphere strongly supports Lila’s motivation, though the abandoned wall’s integration feels peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through Lila’s journey from shame to healing, with strong imagery and symbolism (sewing as mending); the theme of doubt as growth is clear, though the ending lacks a final punch for true memorability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the coral-sewing metaphor is fresh and the perspective unique, some language veers into overly ornate territory (e.g., “luminous stitch”), risking purple prose; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the sewing kit and doubt, leaving a lingering reflection on growth; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels slightly constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
