<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the nondescript seerâ€™s analytically innovative trait drives actions, but motivation feels vague and reactions to the USB drive are more symbolic than revealing of personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure holds together with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present, though delayed justice as a concept drives the plot more through theme than action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout with evocative sensory details like petrichor and stale frosting, enhancing mood and setting; the abandoned control tower complements the tone of innocent cynicism effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes thought through symbolism and delayed justice, with strong imagery, but the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying; subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is mixed; metaphors like rain and frosting are fresh, but synesthetic decoding feels forced and slightly formulaic; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
