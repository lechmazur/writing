<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mute courier's silence shapes his mysterious aura, but his motivation lacks depth; the longing for hidden meanings feels vague and underdeveloped. His interaction with the guide reveals a suppressed desire, yet his personality lacks a distinct edge or nuanced reaction to fully captivate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the comet's guidance driving the courier's actions logically. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution, while poetic, lacks a stronger causal link to earlier tensions, weakening overall coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The run-down opera house and storm-battered harbor create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like snow on velvet seats and forgotten arias. The setting deeply supports the tone of cautious enchantment, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (comet as catalyst, snow as notes) evoke emotion and reflection, with subtext about memory and loss adding depth. The ending is purposeful, yet the central conflict feels understated, and the lack of dialogue limits character voice impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its surreal elements and metaphoric depth, avoiding overt clich√©s. However, some imagery (e.g., pages as doves) feels slightly overused, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at a less personal style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of introspection. However, the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength in fully exploring themes.</comment>
