<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the exorcist’s stage fright shaping her internal conflict, but motivation feels slightly inconsistent—her drive to sculpt possibility feels abrupt against her initial paralysis. Her voice, though distinct in internal monologue, lacks depth in dialogue or external expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of submerging driving action, but pacing feels uneven—early exposition drags, and resolution rushes. Cause and effect are logical, yet coherence suffers from abrupt shifts in focus between personal and cosmic stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, complementing the defiant hush tone. Sensory details like the vacuum’s silence are evocative, though some connections between setting and object feel forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is notable with strong imagery (petals as curtains) and a satisfying ending, but emotional resonance is undercut by telling over showing in key moments. Subtext around inheritance is present yet not fully layered; central conflict resolves too neatly for lasting reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is mixed—while the concept of lies in petals is fresh, some metaphors (stage fright peeling like paint) feel generic. Emotional handling shows nuance in places but leans on stated feelings elsewhere. Overall style is individual but occasionally overwrought, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>General cohesion is adequate despite numerous elements, with creative integration of themes like inheritance and possibility. However, style sometimes obscures clarity with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth of impact.</comment>
