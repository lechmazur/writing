<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivations (the apothecary’s exile and desire for neutrality, the engineer’s hope), but their development feels slightly surface-level within the word limit, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuanced voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the butterfly migration as a guiding thread, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between spores and emotional bonding are somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting and atmosphere of exile are vividly evoked with strong sensory details (steam, brass, amber light), enhancing the mood of battered marvel, though some connections between setting and action feel incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through themes of exile and unconventional love, with striking imagery (butterflies as constellations), but the ending feels slightly unresolved, and subtext is present yet not fully layered for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While imagery like “golden shrapnel” is fresh, the narrative occasionally leans on ornate language bordering on purple prose, and emotional resonance sometimes feels stated rather than shown, lacking deeper human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative integration of butterflies and spores, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but stylistic flourishes sometimes obscure clarity, and the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
