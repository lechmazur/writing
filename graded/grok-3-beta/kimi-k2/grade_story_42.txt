<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of guilt and redemption is clear, driving the master forgerâ€™s actions, but the internal struggle lacks deeper nuance or specific personal history to make his transformation fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing is uneven; the introspective focus slows momentum, and the final release of the ledger feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting of the cliffside temple with turbines is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (wind, sound, moonlight), enhancing the mood of resignation and turmoil; atmosphere powerfully supports the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but overly dense language sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as sharply as top-tier work demands.</comment>
