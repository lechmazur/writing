<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arlo’s curiosity as a tinkerer drives his actions, but his deeper emotional conflict and motivation for amends feel underdeveloped, lacking nuanced internal struggle beyond surface-level intent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between wishes and transformation lacks clear causality, slightly disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The nano-scale city and timeframe of remorse and forgiveness create a striking atmosphere, with evocative metaphors like “regrets were skyscrapers,” though sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood through symbolism of the mask and locket, with subtext about reconciliation, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of vivid character reactions and a somewhat predictable resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its nano-scale metaphor and wish-driven transformation, avoiding overt clichés, though some imagery (e.g., “lattice of light”) feels slightly generic, and emotional depth could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of concepts like wishes and nano-circuits, but the brevity feels somewhat limiting, and the style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity.</comment>
