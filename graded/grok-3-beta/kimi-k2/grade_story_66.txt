<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of the quiet deserter seeking belonging is clear, but the internal conflict and voice feel underdeveloped; actions align with guilt and redemption, yet lack deeper nuance in emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a sense of resolution, but pacing feels uneven—some symbolic moments linger too long while key transitions are abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting and sensory details (loam scent, leaf rustling) create a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone of noble foolishness and enhances the character’s introspective journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cracked mirror, masks) and subtext around guilt and growth evokes reflection, but emotional impact is diluted by occasional over-telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story offers originality in combining plant communication with war guilt, but some metaphors (jigsaw puzzles, kaleidoscope) feel overused, and emotional depth lacks consistent human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering theme of redemption through nature, but stylistic flourishes sometimes hinder clarity over a tight narrative.</comment>
