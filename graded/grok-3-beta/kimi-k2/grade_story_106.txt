<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s sullen nature as a farmer is evident, and her motivation to escape a dead end is clear, but her transformation into a cartographer lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance; her actions align with motivation but feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and end, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the glowing quilt and communal quilt-building feel abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underwater power station is vividly rendered with sensory details like groaning turbines and cracked glass, enhancing the mood of desolation and rebirth; the atmosphere supports Mara’s motivation, though the shift to fresh-turned earth feels incongruous with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through themes of renewal and boundary-erasing, with strong metaphors like the quilt as a map; however, the ending feels slightly overwrought, and the conflict resolution lacks a sharper edge of tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining stamps and quilts to erase boundaries, with fresh imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., “borrowed valor shimmering”) feel ornate and slightly forced; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of reinvention; however, the style sometimes veers into overly poetic language, slightly hindering clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
