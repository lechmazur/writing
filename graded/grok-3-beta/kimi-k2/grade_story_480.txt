<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to reignite a raw edge is clear, but the social media exorcist lacks depth beyond a surface-level quirkiness; actions align with curiosity, yet personality feels underdeveloped with no distinct voice emerging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed transitions; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks impact, leaving the story feeling incomplete despite creative elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like mildew and rust snow, enhancing the abandoned mess hall setting; however, the tone of indifferent enthusiasm occasionally clashes with the darker, ritualistic mood.</comment>
