<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to guilt and reconciliation is clear, but the wilderness guide’s personality lacks distinct depth beyond the central trauma; actions align with motivation, though the voice feels more symbolic than individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing is uneven—some imagery slows momentum, and cause-effect links between guilt and ritual are implied rather than explicit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the sunken ballroom is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the tone of manic clarity, though the setting’s connection to the character’s motivation feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (blanket, ring) and subtext around guilt creates emotional impact, but the ending feels more neat than resonant; conflict resolution is clear but lacks lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors are fresh (e.g., chandeliers as kelp crowns), but some emotional descriptions lean toward stated rather than shown; overall style is distinctive, though not fully free of ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of setting and theme, but style occasionally overshadows clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not a profoundly unique one.</comment>
