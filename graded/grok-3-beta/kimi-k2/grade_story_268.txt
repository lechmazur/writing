<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to master an ancient art is clear and tied to personal loss, but the "subdued vigilante" trait lacks depth in action or personality beyond introspection; voice is indistinct with minimal dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels somewhat complete within word limit, with a reflective resolution, but pacing is unevenâ€”introspection overshadows action, and the virtual call element disrupts narrative flow without clear purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" tone create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like the flickering board; however, virtual calls feel disconnected from the setting's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes melancholy and loss through symbolism of the mirror and bead, with some subtext on identity, but the ending feels more resigned than impactful; minimal dialogue limits character interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with strong imagery (e.g., "screaming silence"), but relies on familiar war-loss tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but emotions are more told than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of theme, and the brief length feels deliberate, but lacks a lingering question or deeper resonance beyond surface narrative.</comment>
