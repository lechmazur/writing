<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The living statue’s telepathic nature and motivation to find truth are intriguing and consistent, but the character lacks depth beyond this singular drive; the girl feels underdeveloped, a mere catalyst without a distinct voice or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the search for truth driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—key moments like the statue stepping down are rushed, and cause-effect links between telepathy and crowd reactions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details (bronze mist, bruised gold dusk), enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness and supporting the statue’s motivation; however, the timeframe’s integration feels peripheral rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought with its exploration of truth and uses strong imagery (soot on tongue, tear-washed marble), but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a sharper punch of tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is original, some metaphors (e.g., “storm of deceit”) feel generic, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown; the style has individuality but occasionally slips into overly ornate language that distracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like telepathy and calligraphy, leaving a lingering question about truth; however, the style sometimes prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
