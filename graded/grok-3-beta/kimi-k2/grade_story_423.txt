<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's earnestness is evident, and his motivation to spark flames in a frozen land is clear, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; tears and memories are stated rather than deeply explored through nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between tears and triggering warmth is conceptually interesting yet lacks logical grounding, leaving coherence slightly strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ruined aqueduct and arid desert setting, combined with perpetual frost, create a striking contrast that enhances the nostalgic tone; sensory details like crystallizing breath and desert wind are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Sir Aldric's tears and memories, with strong symbolism in the map and tears as seeds of fire; however, the theme of memory melting ice feels heavy-handed, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a sharper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the imagery of tears as constellations is fresh, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of loss and renewal without subversion; emotional resonance is present but often stated directly rather than shown, and some metaphors feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering sense of hope; however, the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity, and the depth feels constrained by the word limit.</comment>
