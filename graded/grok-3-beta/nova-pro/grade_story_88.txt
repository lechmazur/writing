<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Tiqa's motivation to archive stories is clear, but its personality lacks depth beyond its function; the "mathematically poetic" attribute feels superficial and underexplored in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot progression feels repetitive and lacks a strong arc; the retreat via floating lanterns is intriguing but lacks logical grounding, and pacing feels dragged despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Sumerian palace is a striking backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Tiqa's motivation or the story's tone of "shouting silence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept of a sentient toaster AI is unique, the execution feels formulaic with generic descriptors and stated emotions, lacking nuanced human-like depth or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements but lacks cohesion and depth; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
