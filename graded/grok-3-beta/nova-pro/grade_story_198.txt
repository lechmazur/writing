<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with the caretaker’s quest, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but lacks lasting impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on predictable tropes of ancient relics and hidden truths without subversion; metaphors like “fragile ferocity” feel forced, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is present, but the story feels constrained by its elements rather than elevated by them; it lacks a lingering thought or unique perspective for the reader.</comment>
