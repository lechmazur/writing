<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the knight's "grudgingly sweet" attribute feels surface-level and underexplored in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed; the arc feels incomplete, with the resolution lacking impact due to insufficient buildup within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of joyful agony, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance and symbolism (e.g., brass door knocker), but the impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the theme feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable knight-in-distress tropes and generic descriptors; metaphors like "beacon of hope and despair" feel overused, lacking fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; it incorporates assigned elements but lacks the creative spark or depth needed for a lasting impression.</comment>
