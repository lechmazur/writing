<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the twin's drive to uncover identity feels generic and their unique mark on the wrist is underutilized in shaping personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between elements like the prophecy and the meeting are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is inconsistently evoked; the mountain peak and crystal shadows offer potential, but sensory details are sparse, failing to fully immerse the reader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clich√©d tropes like the prophecy and hidden cave; language feels formulaic at times, lacking a distinct authorial voice or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the story lacks a lingering impact or depth.</comment>
