<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with overused metaphors like "cosmic blink" and lacks originality; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts unnaturally, suggesting a lack of authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth, leaving no lingering impact or creative spark.</comment>
