<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Samuel's impassive and personally impersonal nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict; his motivation to witness grace feels vague and lacks grounding in his stoic persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or tension; the journey through the orchard feels meandering, and the connection between beginning and end is weak despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lush orchard in an abandoned cathedral is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, but the timeframe of "during oil changes" feels disconnected and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While imagery and symbolism (bees, orchard) are present, the emotional impact is muted; the story tells more than shows, and the ending lacks a powerful resolution or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clich√©s but relies on generic descriptors and overused metaphors (e.g., "heart as a fortress"); emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style feels ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lasting impression or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
