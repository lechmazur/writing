<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the diplomat's confusion and desire for understanding are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, resulting in a somewhat flat portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and lacks logical coherence in connecting the key to the birds' patterns; the resolution feels abrupt and unearned within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional impact with the joyfully tragic theme, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of birds is intriguing but not fully integrated into a satisfying conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality with the subterranean village concept, but metaphors like "counterpoint of hearts" feel forced and generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly inserted rather than organic to the narrative, and the style lacks clarity and depth to elevate the brief length into a deliberate strength.</comment>
