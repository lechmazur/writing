<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Father Ignatius’ stage fright is mentioned but not deeply explored or integrated into his actions beyond initial dread. Motivation to confront lies is clear but lacks nuance or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc; the ritual and resolution feel abrupt and predictable within the word limit. Pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions between setup and climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully support the tone or character’s emotional journey. Connection to toys and action feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or memorable craft; symbolism of wildflowers is heavy-handed, and the ending feels formulaic rather than satisfying. Conflict is present but resolved too neatly without tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by predictable tropes of exorcism and inherited secrets; writing lacks a distinct style, relying on generic descriptors and stated emotions rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels disjointed despite incorporating assigned elements; brevity seems a limitation rather than a strength, and creative integration is minimal, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
