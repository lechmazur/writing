<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the accidental double-booking feels forced and disconnected from the core action of analyzing the telescope, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant setting is vividly described with sensory details like humming machinery, and the tone of comforting unease fits, but the connection between setting and telescope feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for depth with themes of creation and legacy, but it often tells rather than shows emotion and lacks a strong emotional impact or memorable subtext; the ending feels vague rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the narrative relies on generic descriptors and predictable symbolism (telescope as a gateway to the past), lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
