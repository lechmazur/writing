<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or progression; the revelation around the sock feels forced and disconnected from a logical cause-effect chain, making the story feel incomplete despite the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the sock and equilibrium, but the impact is undermined by overt explanation rather than showing; lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing relies on abstract, flowery language ("tangibly abstract," "coded desperation") that feels forced and lacks originality; metaphors are generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite incorporating assigned elements; lacks cohesive style or lingering impact, with creative integration of elements feeling more obligatory than inspired.</comment>
