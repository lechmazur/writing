<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness is present but lacks depth; her transformation feels surface-level with motivations that are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between the cryptic message and emotional growth is underdeveloped, lacking strong cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elara's motivation or the story's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance but relies on telling over showing; symbolism of stones is heavy-handed, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the concept of stones as emotional metaphors shows some originality, the execution feels formulaic with generic descriptors and predictable emotional arcs, lacking a unique voice or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style is simplistic, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice; it lacks lingering impact.</comment>
