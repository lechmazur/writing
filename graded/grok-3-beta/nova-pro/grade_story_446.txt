<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; the art of unbecoming drives the narrative, but the connection between actions and outcomes lacks clarity and logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds setting is evocative and ties well to the ethereal tone, with sensory details enhancing atmosphere; however, the charity drive timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through transformation but often tells rather than shows emotions; imagery like petals falling is overused, and the ending lacks a strong emotional or thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on generic metaphors and predictable transformation tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
