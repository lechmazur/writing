<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on clich√©s like the mysterious object and dreamscape without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it lacks cohesion and depth; the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
