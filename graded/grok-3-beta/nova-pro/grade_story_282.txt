<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the nautilus shell and medal, but lacks emotional resonance or subtext; the ending feels forced rather than satisfying, with no clear conflict or theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate language and generic descriptors like "dusty exuberance" suggest formulaic writing; metaphors are clich√©d, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; style is overwrought, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
