<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lyra's selflessness is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict; motivation to map migration patterns feels abstract and lacks personal stakes or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels repetitive and lacks tension; the action of lunging is abrupt and underdeveloped, and pacing suffers from redundant descriptions within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and centuries-long timeframe are intriguing but underexplored; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the tone or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional resonance but relies on telling rather than showing; imagery is present but often generic, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on clich√©s of music as a universal connector without subversion; metaphors are overused and lack freshness, and emotional portrayal feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it lacks cohesion and depth; the style is overly ornate at times, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a strength.</comment>
