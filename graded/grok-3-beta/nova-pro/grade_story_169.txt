<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; the soul-broker's motivation to recover forgotten songs feels vague and underdeveloped, with no personal stakes or backstory to anchor their actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or conflict; while the concept of reading reversed labels is intriguing, it doesn't drive a discernible beginning, middle, or end within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the floating tea platform is evocative and supports the weirdly static tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of poetic imagery, but lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying conclusion; the central conflict is too abstract to evoke a strong response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some originality in combining soul-brokering with forgotten songs, but reliance on generic descriptors and repetitive phrasing around "dusty bottles" diminishes authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite creative elements; the brief length seems more a limitation than a deliberate choice, and it lacks a lingering impact or cohesive depth.</comment>
