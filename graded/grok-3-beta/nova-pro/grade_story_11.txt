<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while the concept of unity influences the narrative, the pacing feels repetitive and the story struggles to achieve completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The secret society initiation hall is evocative, but sensory details are sparse; the atmosphere supports the tone of serene anger to some extent, though the setting's connection to the object feels forced.</comment>
