<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to restore traditional systems is clear, but the hesitant swordsman’s awkwardness feels superficial and underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes actions or reactions to the postcard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the connection between beginning and end is vague, and pacing is uneven, with rushed transformation undermining coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and supports the atmosphere of transformation, but sensory details are inconsistent, and the setting’s connection to motivation feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with shells and bridging worlds, but emotional impact is weak due to telling rather than showing; ending lacks satisfaction, and central conflict is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable transformation tropes without subversion; metaphors like “emerging from a shell” are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth rather than deliberate restraint.</comment>
