<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to topple an idol of fear is intriguing but underdeveloped; the astronomer's awe and rational approach lack depth in action and voice, feeling more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; moral dilemmas and snowflake patterns are conceptually present but fail to drive a cohesive narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes is vividly described and enhances atmosphere; sensory details like crystal shadows are evocative, though connection to character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story has symbolic depth with snowflakes and the veil, but emotional impact is muted by abstract telling rather than showing; ending lacks a satisfying punch despite thematic intent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like snowflake patterns and moral dilemmas, but reliance on generic metaphors and stated emotions rather than nuanced showing undermines authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in blending elements, but cohesion suffers from abstract focus over narrative clarity; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
