<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Ethan’s "tortured protector" role lacks depth or distinct voice, and his motivation feels vague and unsupported by specific backstory or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there’s a discernible arc, pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the planetarium encounter and the climax is tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus dressing room setting is evocative with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the character’s motivation or the story’s tone, missing deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or subtext; imagery is present but often generic, and the central conflict feels forced rather than naturally resolved, with little depth beyond surface events.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clichéd phrases and predictable tropes like the "storm within"; metaphors are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks clarity or lasting impact, failing to leave a lingering thought or feeling.</comment>
