<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's "apathetic eagerness" feels contradictory and underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced motivation beyond the surface-level goal of studying soil patterns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is inconsistent; the connection between radio frequencies and soil patterns feels forced, and pacing is uneven, with a rushed resolution that lacks a satisfying arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The giant's shoe setting is intriguing and ties to the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the harvesting timeframe feels incidental rather than integral to the mood or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth, leaving no lingering impact or creative spark.</comment>
