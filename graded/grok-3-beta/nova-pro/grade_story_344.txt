<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's claustrophobia and heavyheartedness are mentioned but not deeply explored or convincingly tied to her actions. Motivation lacks depth beyond curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc; the discovery of the tea house feels convenient rather than earned, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the floating rock tea house is intriguing but underdeveloped; sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere doesn't fully support the tone or character struggles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; symbolism of glasses is forced, and the ending feels predictable rather than resonant. Little subtext or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clich√©d healing-through-connection trope; language feels generic, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel tacked on rather than integral, and the story lacks a lingering impact or creative depth despite the short length.</comment>
