<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Wei’s calm demeanor as an assassin is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to fulfill a prophecy feels vague and lacks personal depth or emotional stakes, failing to reveal nuanced layers of his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and incomplete; the connection between the prophecy and the butterfly pattern is tenuous, and the pacing struggles within the word limit, leaving key cause-effect links unclear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is evocative with sensory details like aged paper and ink, enhancing the mystique, but the humorous unease tone feels forced and inconsistent with the somber atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; while imagery like the butterfly wings is present, the ending feels unsatisfying, and the central conflict remains too abstract to engage the reader fully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on generic descriptors and predictable prophecy tropes without subversion; metaphors like “tapestry of time” feel overused, and the writing lacks a distinct style or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it lacks cohesion and depth; the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and it fails to leave a lasting impression or lingering thought.</comment>
