<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the connection between rose petals and the red streak is vague, and pacing is uneven with repetitive focus on dreams over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine library setting is evocative and supports the mood, but sensory details are limited to generic "scent of old books," missing deeper immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with repetitive phrases like "unruffled" and generic descriptors; lacks originality in metaphor and emotional nuance, suggesting a predictable template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but feels forced; style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
