<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; the mapping of migration routes feels disconnected from the holiday context, and pacing is uneven within the word limit, with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ravine and orchard setting is evocative and ties to the stormy atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection to character motivation remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or subtext; the rusty nail as a symbol feels forced, and the narrative relies on telling rather than showing, with a predictable resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by generic descriptors and predictable tropes about community resilience; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking a unique style or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth, failing to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
