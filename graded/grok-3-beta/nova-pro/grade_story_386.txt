<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to bind old wounds is present but lacks depth; the "trustworthy yet strange" attribute feels superficial and underexplored in actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the catapult action driving a symbolic climax, but pacing feels rushed and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the atom-powered lighthouse is evocative and ties to the tone of borrowed dawn, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the tablecloth, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes of loss and defiance without subversion; metaphors like "fabric of the cosmos" are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style lacks clarity and depth; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, with little lingering impact.</comment>
