<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of docking hopes feels forced and lacks clear cause-effect progression; pacing is uneven, with rushed climactic moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is intriguing and somewhat enhances the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and candle mold feels tenuous.</comment>
