<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore a lost art form is intriguing, but her character lacks depth and distinct voice; her rebellious nature feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between Elara's discovery of the mask and organ and the broader revolution feels tenuous; pacing is rushed, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ancient library and giant's bookshelf create an evocative setting, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the revolutionary tone and Elara's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the mask and organ, but emotional impact is shallow due to 'telling' over 'showing'; the ending lacks a satisfying punch, and the central conflict feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the concept of obituaries for the living is unique, the narrative leans on predictable rebellion tropes without subversion; metaphors like the mask's shifting expressions feel generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion among its many elements, feeling forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a limitation, and the overall impact lacks lingering depth or resonance.</comment>
