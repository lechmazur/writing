<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the arrogant swordsman’s transformation from doubt to certainty feels abrupt and unearned, lacking depth in motivation or internal conflict beyond surface-level description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is inconsistent; while there is a discernible arc, the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the action and resolution lacks logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of harsh tenderness feels forced rather than naturally integrated with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth; while imagery and symbolism are present, they feel heavy-handed, and the ending, though purposeful, fails to evoke a strong response or lingering reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clichéd metaphors and predictable transformation tropes; the writing lacks a distinct voice and relies on generic descriptors instead of nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative, and the style lacks clarity, failing to leave a lasting impression or demonstrate significant creative depth.</comment>
