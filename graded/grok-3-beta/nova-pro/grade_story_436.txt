<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of dream catchers offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of lost heritage and mystical oracles without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but their integration often feels contrived; it lacks a lingering depth or unique style to elevate it beyond a functional narrative.</comment>
