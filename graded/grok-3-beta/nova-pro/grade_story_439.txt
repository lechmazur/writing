<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the mute courier's motivation feels vague and lacks depth beyond the assigned traits, with no distinct voice or nuanced reaction to interdimensional travel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a loose arc, pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between portal generation and emotional delivery are unclear within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic descriptors and predictable interdimensional tropes; metaphors like "comet’s light" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, style is simplistic, and the story lacks a lingering depth or creative spark beyond surface narrative.</comment>
