<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with the smuggler's frustration and longing for escape, but the portrayal lacks depth; the irate nature feels surface-level and reactions to the chopstick and tea leaves are not fully revealing of personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; jogging as an action doesn't effectively drive a narrative arc, and the story feels incomplete despite the word limit, with pacing that meanders without clear resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with tea leaf imagery and symbolic waterfalls, but emotional resonance is shallow, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch; conflict is present but not sharply defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive phrases like "heart's revolt" and generic imagery; metaphors are somewhat fresh but lack specificity, and emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style lacks clarity, with the short length feeling more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
