<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Thaddeus's grumpiness is surface-level and lacks depth; his transformation feels abrupt and unearned, with trauma as a motivation introduced too late to resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels forced; the connection between jiggling the tube and scrying lacks logical grounding, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The witch's scrying room and ancient forest create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are generic, and the setting's connection to trauma feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional depth but relies on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the mandala and tube is heavy-handed, and the ending lacks impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with overused metaphors like "tapestry of human experience"; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, lacking originality or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel tacked on rather than integral, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and depth.</comment>
