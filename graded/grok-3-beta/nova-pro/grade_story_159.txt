<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the philosopher-king's "earnestly frivolous" nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to solve the labyrinth is clear but lacks emotional depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of extending confetti-coded proposals feels forced and disconnected from the labyrinth's resolution. Pacing is rushed, and the ending lacks a satisfying arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns is vividly described and supports the ethereal tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the weddings and betrayal feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; the betrayal and transformation are stated rather than shown. Imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable progression; the kaleidoscope and confetti proposals feel gimmicky rather than innovative. Emotional nuance is lacking, relying on explicit statements over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. Style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
