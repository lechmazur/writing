<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Alistair's desire to reclaim his legacy, but his personality lacks depth beyond the archetypal fallen aristocrat; actions align with motivation, yet his voice and nuanced traits are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete with a distinct beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of harmonizing drives the narrative; however, pacing is slightly rushed, and some cause-effect links feel forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocatively described with strong sensory details (rusted metal, wilting lilies), enhancing the tone of blurry vividness and supporting the legacy theme; minor disconnect between setting and timeframe integration slightly weakens immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (nightshade vine, coaster tracks) and imagery creates subtext about legacy and redemption; emotional impact is present but not fully resonant due to surface-level character exploration; ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining legacy with a haunted coaster, and metaphors like liquid amber are fresh; however, reliance on predictable gothic tropes and occasional ornate language (e.g., "fragrant promise of redemption") detracts from authenticity; emotional nuance is present but inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the botanical illustration and legacy's burden; style supports clarity, but the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate; leaves a lingering thought about redemption, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
