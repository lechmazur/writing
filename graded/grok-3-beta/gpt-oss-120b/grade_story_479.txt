<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character of the glamorous undertaker is intriguing but lacks depth; motivation to preserve ancient practices feels stated rather than deeply felt or explored through nuanced actions or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; the action of elongating objects drives the narrative but feels repetitive and lacks a strong resolution or clear arc within the word limit, leaving the story feeling incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with evocative imagery (e.g., pigments swirling like sunrise over a tomb), effectively supporting the tone of jubilant remorse, though the social network archive setting feels underutilized and disconnected from the sensory richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with strong symbolism (brass tape as life and memory), but the emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling of emotions like jubilant remorse rather than showing through subtle action or subtext; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly ornate language and generic metaphors (e.g., funeral bell echo); while the concept is unique, the execution feels formulaic at times, lacking the raw human nuance needed for authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the style leans toward complexity over clarity, diminishing impact; lacks a lingering depth beyond surface ritual.</comment>
