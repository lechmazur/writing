<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape a dead-end life is clear, but the sullen farmer's personality lacks depth and distinct voice; reactions to the quilt and stamps feel symbolic rather than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; connections between action (zest) and outcome (power station revival) are tenuous and lack logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Underwater power station setting is evocative with sensory details like humming pressure, but its connection to the quilt and stamps feels forced; atmosphere supports tone of borrowed valor unevenly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with quilt and stamps, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling; ending is purposeful yet lacks resonance; central theme of erasing boundaries is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by generic metaphors (e.g., “water receding like a curtain”); emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown; narrative lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; lingering impact is minimal due to surface-level execution.</comment>
