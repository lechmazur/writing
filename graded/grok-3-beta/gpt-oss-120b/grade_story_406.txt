<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to become a master of disguise drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single trait, and her voice is not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit, and the connection between reversed time and the broader narrative feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch’s potion brewery setting enhances the mystical atmosphere, and sensory details like the glow of the vial are evocative, though the timeframe’s integration feels underwhelming and underexplored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors like “borrowed valor” feel overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking the nuance expected for top-tier originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
