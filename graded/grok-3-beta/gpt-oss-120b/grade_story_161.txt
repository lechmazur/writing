<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to punctuality and grief is clear, but the vigilant orchardist’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond these traits; reactions to the conspiracy lack deeper emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, and the conspiracy drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and some cause-effect links, like the alarm triggering exposure, are abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the sardonic tone or character’s grief-driven motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through grief and triumph, with some effective symbolism (paper wings, peacock seal), but lacks deeper subtext; conflict resolution feels convenient rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like paper airplanes and conspiracies, but metaphors (e.g., grief folded into purpose) are predictable; emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought of vigilance, though depth feels limited by surface-level exploration.</comment>
