<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; the curator’s guilt and drive to repopulate feel stated rather than deeply explored or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; the road trip and temple discovery lack clear causal links, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid with imaginative elements like the floating museum and temple, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like “silent overture” feel overused, and emotional handling lacks nuance, bordering on formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story integrates many elements with moderate cohesion, but the style often obscures clarity, and the short length feels limiting rather than intentional.</comment>
