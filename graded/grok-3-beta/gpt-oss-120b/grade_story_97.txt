<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the oracle's pursuit of empathy, but the "desperately casual" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed and lacks depth in shaping her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between heartbreak visions and recomposing the world lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly described and enhances the mood of uncertainty, but sensory details are uneven, and the timeframe "whispered minute" feels underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the compass and empathy as a bridge, evoking some emotional response, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of shared pain lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like heartbreak visions and an unstable dimension, but metaphors like "glass sculpture" and "shifting sands" are generic, and emotional portrayal often leans on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with creative intent, but the style occasionally veers into overwrought prose, and the storyâ€™s brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
