<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to prove midnight's finite nature is clear but lacks depth; the "strangely trustworthy" attribute feels underutilized and does not significantly shape actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments; cause and effect are logical, yet the concept of mirroring the soul doesn't fully drive the narrative's direction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the witch's flying carpet garage is vivid and enhances the atmosphere of frantic peace; sensory details like moonlit oil and humming threads are evocative, though some connections between setting and object feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity through symbolic use of the seashell and mirror, with a satisfying ending; however, deeper subtext is present but not fully explored, and emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like the seashell and midnight, with some fresh metaphors; yet, certain phrases feel overly ornate, and emotional depiction occasionally leans on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style sometimes overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about time's nature, though not powerfully so.</comment>
