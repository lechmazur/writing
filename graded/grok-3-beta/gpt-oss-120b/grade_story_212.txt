<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to escape the overseer’s control is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her interaction with the cards feels more symbolic than personal, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with seeds and boundaries driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the resolution lacks a grounded sense of finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and post-resource war timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, with vivid sensory details like glowing seedlings and humming cards; however, the setting's connection to the overseer’s control feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism around boundaries evoke thought, and the theme of rewriting limits is clear, but emotional resonance is limited by Mara’s underdeveloped character; the ending feels purposeful yet slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of singing boundaries and trick cards is original, some metaphors (e.g., “sea of sky”) feel overused; emotional depiction leans toward stated rather than shown, and the style, though distinct, borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like cards and boundaries, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with dense imagery; it leaves a lingering idea of freedom, though not powerfully felt due to character depth issues.</comment>
