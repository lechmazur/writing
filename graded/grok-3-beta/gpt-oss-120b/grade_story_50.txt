<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism as an unconvinced missionary is central, but her transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth in internal conflict; motivation is present but not fully explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from doubt to belief is clear, with the piano’s echoes driving the action logically, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and some cause-effect links (fork’s power) are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass desert is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the tone of solitary intimacy; the setting strongly supports the mood, though the butterfly migration feels slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (fork, piano echoes) add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is inconsistent—some moments feel told rather than shown; central theme of faith is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers some originality in combining elements like the piano cipher, but metaphors occasionally veer into overuse (“broken mirrors”); emotional handling is nuanced at times but lacks consistent depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the fork and piano, but style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
