<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's rashness as a protector is present but underdeveloped; his longing for the stars feels vague and lacks depth in motivation, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the postcards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the postcards driving a quiet action, but pacing feels uneven, and cause-effect links between discovery and cosmic realization are somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and howling caverns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the mystical tone and Kael’s quest for solace, though sensory details could be sharper and more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kael’s transformation, with decent use of symbolism (postcards as portals), but lacks a strong central conflict and deeper subtext; the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of postcards as cosmic maps shows originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of guardians and cosmic destiny without subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic, lacking nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but not striking, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
