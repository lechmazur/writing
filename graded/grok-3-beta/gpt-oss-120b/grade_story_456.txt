<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand cosmic cycles is clear, but the "morbid florist" lacks depth in personality beyond surface traits; reactions to objects feel symbolic but not personally revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of arranging roses drives symbolism but lacks a concrete resolution or clear cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo enhances the ethereal tone and complements cosmic themes, with strong sensory details like distant thunder; however, connection to character motivation feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (black roses, candle) are evocative, but emotional impact is muted by overly conceptual focus; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the tone occasionally dips into purple prose; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative risks predictability in its mystic framework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but style often overshadows clarity; length feels restrictive rather than deliberate, and lingering impact is more conceptual than emotional.</comment>
