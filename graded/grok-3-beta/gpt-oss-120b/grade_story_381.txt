<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map the cave systems is clear, but the hushed necromancer's personality lacks depth beyond quirky traits like the baseball cap and movie obsession; actions align with motivation but lack a distinct voice or nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with mapping as the central action, achieving a sense of arc within the word limit; however, pacing feels uneven with overemphasis on imagery over conflict development, and coherence is mildly disrupted by abrupt shifts to movie projections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with strong sensory details like phosphorescent mist and resonant hums, effectively supporting the futuristic nostalgia tone and character motivation; connection to timeframe feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through nostalgic imagery and resolve, with decent use of symbolism (crystal maps, movies); ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact; conflict is present but underdeveloped within word constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending necromancy with futuristic nostalgia and movie ciphers, but reliance on familiar labyrinth tropes and generic descriptors (e.g., “dying neon sign”) dilutes uniqueness; emotional nuance is limited, often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like movies and resolve, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language hindering clarity; brief length works but lacks profound lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
