<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to hold onto hope is clear, but the weary undertaker lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than personal nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between actions and tribal knowledge are somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details of the palace and clock; the tone of placid ferocity enhances the setting, though the car backfire feels slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes a quiet intensity with effective imagery and symbolism (clock as time/darkness map), but the ending lacks a deeper emotional punch or lingering subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like sun paths and tribal knowledge, but some metaphors (e.g., "river of molten gold") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate over clarity; it leaves a faint lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
