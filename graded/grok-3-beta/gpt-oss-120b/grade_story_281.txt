<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the baffled pickpocket's transformation is intriguing, but his motivations feel superficially tied to the dummy's influence rather than deeply rooted in personal history or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent within the word limit, but the arc feels forced, with the transformation hinging on an abstract concept that lacks grounding; pacing is rushed toward the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone, but sensory details are inconsistently applied, missing opportunities to deepen the oppressive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through metaphorical language, but the emotional resonance is undercut by overt explanation of the transformation, failing to fully "show" the internal shift; the theme lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on gothic tropes without sufficient subversion; metaphors like "scorching poise" feel strained, and emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; while creative in combining elements, the execution feels labored, and the style occasionally obscures clarity, leaving little lasting impression beyond surface intrigue.</comment>
