<<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s aloofness as an orphan is present but underdeveloped; her motivation to transform fear into courage feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the garage cleaning and gravitational anomaly, but pacing feels uneven, and the resolution of adapting feels somewhat abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is evocative and ties well to the mood of unease, enhanced by sensory details like the humming and clinking stones; however, some connections to character motivation remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Mara’s subtle shift, with effective symbolism in the stones and lottery ticket, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the conflict is present but understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of gravitational anomaly offers originality, the narrative leans on somewhat generic descriptors for emotions and setting; metaphors like “metallic lullaby” feel slightly forced and not entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
