<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's rebellious nature and motivation to restore a lost art form are clear and consistent, but the first-person voice lacks distinct depth or nuance, feeling more like a vehicle for the plot than a fully realized personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed in the tight word limit, and some cause-effect relationships (e.g., mask's reactions) lack clarity, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the giant's bookshelf is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of entrapment and discovery, with strong sensory details like humming and glass shards, though the timeframe of revolution feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through its theme of art as rebellion, with effective imagery and symbolism (e.g., mask, shattering ceiling), but the ending feels slightly overwrought, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of obituaries for the living is original, some metaphors (e.g., "candle wind") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
