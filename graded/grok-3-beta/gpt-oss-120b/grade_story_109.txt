<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The cold-natured knight's attribute is present but underdeveloped; his transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation beyond the artistic awakening. Actions align superficially, but his voice and personality remain indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between collecting remedies and restoring altars feels contrived. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The secret agent center and late-night intersection create an intriguing backdrop, but sensory details are inconsistent—some evocative, others generic. Atmosphere supports the tone sporadically, lacking immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Symbolism of the mitten and altars shows promise but feels heavy-handed. Emotional impact is stated rather than shown, and the ending lacks resonance. Craft is competent but not impactful or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The story leans on predictable tropes of transformation without subversion. Metaphors like "cold nature melted" are clichéd, and emotional handling lacks nuance, feeling formulaic rather than authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by forced integration of elements, with style occasionally overreaching into ornate language. The brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
