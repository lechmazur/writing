<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity as an inventor drives her actions, but her motivation to honor an impossible promise feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes or internal conflict to make her truly compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with rain patterns driving the action, but the resolution feels rushed and the connection between rain and memory reconstruction lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sailing ship graveyard is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the cosmic and melancholic atmosphere, though the tone occasionally overreaches into abstraction, slightly diluting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through the theme of resonating with the past, supported by strong imagery, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the subtext feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of rain-guided memory reconstruction is original, some metaphors (e.g., “captured moon”) feel slightly overused, and the emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of love across time, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
