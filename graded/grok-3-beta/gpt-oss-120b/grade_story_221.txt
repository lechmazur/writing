<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to step out of shadow is clear, but the wreck-diver ghost whisperer trait feels underexplored beyond surface mentions; lacks depth in personal voice or unique reaction to amber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the amber triggering a revelation, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the family tradition's role in driving action is underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting enhances the melancholic tone and supports the concept of thawing hearts with vivid imagery, though sensory details could be more varied beyond visual cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of renewal, with decent use of symbolism (amber as heart), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable ending; conflict resolution feels too neat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like amber and carnival, but metaphors (e.g., "tide pulling away") feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity seems to limit depth rather than enhance it; lingering impact is present but not striking, as style occasionally overreaches with ornate language.</comment>
