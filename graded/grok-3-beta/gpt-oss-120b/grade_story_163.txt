<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to push limits is clear, but the "bitterly optimistic" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently reflected in actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reaction to the parking stub.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness with a clear resolution, and unifying fragmented reality drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the xenobiology station is vividly realized with strong sensory details like flickering walls and bioluminescent organisms; atmosphere supports the tone of reckless precision, though connection to timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (parking stub as quantum key) add depth, and the ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance is limited by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; lacks profound subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some originality in combining fragmented reality with the parking stub, but metaphors like "reactor core" feel generic; emotional handling lacks nuance, and tone shifts slightly at times, though no glaring AI-like flaws.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the parking stub, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a mild lingering thought, though depth is constrained by brevity.</comment>
