<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the teddy bear’s journey, but pacing feels rushed, and the cosmic disclaimers as a method are inconsistently integrated, disrupting narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive is vividly described with neon skies and crystalline aisles, enhancing the ethereal tone, but sensory details are unevenly applied, limiting full immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
