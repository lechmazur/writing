<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven, with abrupt shifts between teaching and corporate conflict; cause and effect are logical but not always impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panel setting is vivid and enhances the tone of progress versus nature, with strong sensory details like metallic-tasting fruit; however, atmosphere occasionally overshadows character depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on leadership and progress through symbolism (pruning narratives), but lacks emotional depth; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution feels slightly underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of cartography and corporate critique, some metaphors (e.g., pruning narratives) feel overextended; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like pruning and leadership burdens, but style occasionally leans toward ornate over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though impact is muted by uneven depth.</comment>
