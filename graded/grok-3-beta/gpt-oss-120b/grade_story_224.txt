<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape mundanity is clear, but the minstrel’s personality feels underdeveloped; the “openly private” attribute lacks depth in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed resolution; the connection between action and concept is present but not sharply defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere of “gentle turmoil” is well-crafted with evocative sensory details; the giant’s dining room enhances the tone, though the rush hour contrast feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
