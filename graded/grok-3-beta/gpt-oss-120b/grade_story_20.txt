<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation as a disappointed archer is evident, but lacks depth; reactions to objects and settings feel symbolic rather than personal, missing a distinct voice or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with symbolic progression, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between actions and motivations are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the inverted waterfall and celestial dance is evocative and enhances mood, but sensory details are inconsistently specific, and atmosphere occasionally overpowers character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism, but emotional impact is muted by overwrought metaphors; ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance due to insufficient conflict development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable symbolic tropes (e.g., bridge of regret) without subversion; emotional portrayal often states rather than shows, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but style verges on overwrought, hindering clarity; brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice, with limited lingering impact.</comment>
