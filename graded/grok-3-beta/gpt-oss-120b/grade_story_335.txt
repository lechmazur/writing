<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Riven's "shaky" nature and "carefully reckless" attribute are evident in actions, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped, lacking distinctiveness in this short form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the act of finalizing a quest, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between rumor chains and the cathedral could be more logically reinforced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artist haven is vividly realized with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of longing and redemption, though the timeframe's "echoing hour" feels underutilized in deepening mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the spider's release and Riven's redemption, with strong symbolism, but the impact is diluted by occasionally overt narration rather than showing, and the theme feels slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in combining elements like amber and street art, metaphors like the phoenix are somewhat predictable, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone, but stylistic choices occasionally border on ornate, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
