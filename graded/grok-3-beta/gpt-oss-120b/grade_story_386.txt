<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to bind old wounds is clear but lacks depth in execution; the "trustworthy strange" attribute feels superficially applied without shaping distinct personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the catapult action driving a symbolic resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between star alignment and memory launch are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atom-powered lighthouse setting is vividly imagined and enhances the futuristic yet melancholic atmosphere; sensory details like "humming core" are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through imagery of memory as light, with strong symbolism in the tablecloth; however, subtext is somewhat surface-level, and the ending feels more poetic than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original concept of memory catapult is intriguing, but metaphors like "borrowed dawn" are overused; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style leans toward overwrought prose, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering image but lacks deeper questioning or resonance.</comment>
