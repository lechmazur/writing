<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters are sketched with potential, particularly the exiled prince’s longing for companionship, but their motivations lack depth and nuance; the mute herbalist feels underdeveloped and more like a plot device than a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the chance encounter, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end could be more impactful with tighter cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a vivid, isolating atmosphere that complements the theme of loneliness; sensory details like howling wind and dust are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of connection, with some effective symbolism in the mortar and pestle, but the impact is dulled by overly explicit statements of emotion rather than showing through subtext or action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows glimmers of originality, metaphors like “ghostly ribbons” and “invisible thread” feel somewhat clichéd; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable patterns of magical resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, leaving a lingering thought about companionship, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
