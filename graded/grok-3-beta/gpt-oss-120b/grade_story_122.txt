<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to reflect lightning is clear, but the "patiently frantic" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance; the cyber-templar’s voice is indistinct, overshadowed by descriptive excess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc from mirage to revelation is discernible, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause-effect with the prism and storm is logical, though the resolution feels abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the sky burial site is vivid with sensory detail, enhancing the storm’s impact; tone of euphoric agitation aligns well with the setting, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism with the prism and storm evoke thought, but emotional resonance is undermined by stated feelings over shown reactions; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending cyberpunk and spiritual elements, but metaphors like “storm’s heart” feel generic; emotional handling lacks nuance, relying on explicit descriptors, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced; style supports clarity but occasionally veers into ornate excess; leaves a lingering image, yet depth remains surface-level.</comment>
