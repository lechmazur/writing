<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the shepherd's sentimentality and spontaneity are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation feels vague and lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the narrative arc is present but feels forced with abrupt shifts. Coherence suffers due to unclear cause-and-effect links between the coordinates and the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting in the ancient Sumerian palace is evocative with some sensory detail, but atmosphere lacks depth and fails to consistently support the chaotic tone or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolism (fish as justice), but emotional resonance is weak due to telling over showing. Theme of justice and humility is present but not fully developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by overused metaphors (heart beating with universe) and generic descriptors. Writing feels ornate at times, lacking authentic emotional nuance and relying on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. Style is overly complex, hindering clarity, and the story doesn't leave a lasting impression despite creative intent.</comment>
