<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's vendetta as a candy sculptor is intriguing, but motivation feels murky—why despise anonymous kindness? First-person voice is distinct but lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the locket as a goal, but pacing feels rushed at the climax. Connection between sugar art and rebellion is tenuous, causing minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Forgotten market setting is evocative with sensory details like cinnamon dust and sugar scents, enhancing atmosphere. Tone of scorn aligns well with setting, though some connections feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity about the hidden continent, with some effective imagery (sugar-glass portraits). However, emotional resonance is shallow, and conflict resolution feels overly neat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in combining candy sculpting with rebellion, but metaphors like "moths to flame" are clichéd. Emotional handling lacks subtext, leaning on stated feelings over shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like sugar art, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language. Leaves a lingering idea of hope, though impact is moderate.</comment>
