<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of collecting urban legends feels inconsistent with the straight-laced knight trope; the academically rebellious attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped in action and dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; the converging destinies concept drives the narrative, though connections to the championship scoreboard feel tangential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but reliance on predictable knight-scholar alliance trope; metaphors like "tiny lighthouse" are fresh, yet emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a mild impression, lacking the depth for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
