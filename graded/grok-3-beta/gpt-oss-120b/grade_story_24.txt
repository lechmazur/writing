<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The bard's meandering nature and motivation to stir cold hearts are present, but his personality lacks depth beyond poetic gestures; his voice feels more symbolic than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the puppet shows driving action, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the apologetic text element disrupts narrative coherence slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but style sometimes overshadows clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
