<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to unify minds is clear, but the "conventionally rebellious" trait feels underdeveloped and lacks distinct impact on actions or voice; reactions to the wilted flower are symbolic but not deeply revealing of inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, driven by the action of estrangement; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the laundromat scene, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the giant's study and late-night laundromat are evocative with strong sensory details like flickering lights and amber dimness; atmosphere supports the haunting tone well, though the timeframe "between scenes" feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes a lingering sense of hope through decay, with effective symbolism in the wilted flower; yet, dialogue is sparse and lacks depth, and emotional showing is often overtaken by overt telling of the prophet's feelings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements like glimmering transitions and a giant's study, but metaphors like "dying star" feel overused; emotional nuance is present but inconsistently deep, and tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about unity; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity, and brevity feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
