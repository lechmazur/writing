<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing with the diplomat's dual purpose, but the portrayal lacks depth; the confusion and timidity feel surface-level without nuanced internal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between actions and concepts like liberalizing trade are forced and lack logical clarity.</comment>
