<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve folk medicines is present but feels underdeveloped; the "angrily peaceful" attribute is intriguing but inconsistently reflected in actions, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the method of hacking playlists is creative yet tenuously connected to the outcome, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like cotton candy mist and ghost train howls, enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of marathon training feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has moments of emotional impact and symbolism (teapot as relic), but the central conflict lacks sharpness; writing shows rather than tells at times, yet the theme of reconciliation feels surface-level and not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like hacking playlists and ghostly trains, but reliance on familiar haunted park tropes without subversion; metaphors like "angry peace" are interesting yet not always fresh or nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with creative use of elements, but integration occasionally seems forced; style is evocative but not always clear, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
