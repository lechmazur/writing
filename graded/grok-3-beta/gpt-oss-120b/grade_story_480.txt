<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The social media exorcist’s concept is intriguing, but the character lacks depth; motivation feels surface-level and tied to curiosity without nuanced personal stakes or inner conflict. Actions align with the role, but the voice is indistinct and fails to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven; transitions to secret clubs are abrupt, and cause-effect links are vague at times. The action of reigniting drives the story, though coherence wavers with underdeveloped resolutions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and timeframe after the final chord create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like stale coffee and rusted metal. However, the setting’s connection to the object feels tenuous, and tone wavers between indifference and engagement, diluting mood consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity but lacks deep emotional impact or subtext; imagery like “ghost’s sigh” is effective but not sustained. The ending feels purposeful yet underwhelming, and conflict is present but lacks intensity. Showing over telling is inconsistent, with some stated emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar ghost story tropes without subversion; metaphors like “ghostly notifications” feel generic. Emotional handling is surface-level, lacking nuance. While the concept of a social media exorcist shows ingenuity, the execution feels formulaic and lacks a distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic. Style is clear but unremarkable, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice. It leaves a faint lingering thought, but lacks the depth for lasting impact.</comment>
