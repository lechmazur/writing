<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Milo's social awkwardness is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to overcome regret feels surface-level and lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the reversed trails method driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The diner setting and late shift timeframe create a strong, moody atmosphere with evocative sensory details like neon hum, though the connection to the encrypted archive feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (tree of regret) and imagery adds depth, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "tree of regret" border on clich√© without subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
