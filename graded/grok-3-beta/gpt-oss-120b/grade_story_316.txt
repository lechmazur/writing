<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the seraphic seamstress's timidity is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, limiting depth. Motivation is clear but feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the scoreboard and healing is tenuous, undermining logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are evocative with strong imagery of the temple and soot-stained town, but sensory details are inconsistent, and the arcade feels disconnected from the temple's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic stitching and collective healing, but emotional resonance is weakened by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors (e.g., "wings of feathered hope") and a predictable healing arc; while the temple-scoreboard combination is unique, emotional depth lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the style leans toward ornate, obscuring clarity. The story lacks a lingering, profound impact.</comment>
