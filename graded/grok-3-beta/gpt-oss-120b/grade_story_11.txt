<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira’s flighty nature is hinted at through her nervous maps, but her personality lacks depth beyond this trait; her motivation to leave a legacy feels stated rather than shown through nuanced action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the act of linearizing driving the story forward, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the connection between beginning and end is evident but lacks deeper emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The initiation hall setting is vividly described with sensory details like flickering candles and the smell of vellum, enhancing the secretive atmosphere; however, the timeframe "throughout practice" feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Lira’s quiet pride, and imagery like the glowing paintings is effective; yet, the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the theme of unity lacks profound subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., "stone whispers") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but relies on explicit statements like "serene anger" rather than nuanced showing, suggesting a lack of unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the grease-stained patch, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of legacy, though not powerfully so.</comment>
