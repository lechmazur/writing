<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aiko’s role as a remote herbalist is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to provoke unspoken conversation feels abstract and lacks grounding in personal stakes or backstory, making her actions feel more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot’s structure hinges on repositioning a flower to decode meteors, but the arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the resolution is more poetic than conclusive, leaving cause and effect relationships vague and pacing uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Japanese castle and moonlit courtyard create a vivid atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details of meteors and stone walls; however, the setting’s connection to character motivation remains surface-level and lacks deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood through imagery and symbolism of meteors and flowers, but the emotional impact is muted by an overly abstract conflict; the theme of intertwined fates emerges, yet subtext feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding meteors is original, the execution leans on overly ornate language and predictable mystic tropes; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and metaphors like “sky’s calligraphy” feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often prioritizes florid description over clarity; it leaves a lingering mood, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
