<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brann’s jovial nature and reluctance are present but inconsistently portrayed; his shift to solemn focus feels abrupt and lacks depth in emotional transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the treasure quest, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the vow and the telescope’s role is somewhat tenuous.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has moments of emotional resonance and uses imagery well, but the central conflict of doubt feels stated rather than shown, and the ending’s impact is diminished by predictable triumph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on generic descriptors like “steel heart” and predictable fantasy tropes, lacking a truly unique voice or surprising subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
