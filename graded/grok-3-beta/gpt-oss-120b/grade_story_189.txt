<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; the "bright-eyed" trait feels superficial and doesn't distinctly shape actions or voice beyond generic optimism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with the overcharge action, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between notes and star maps are underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid with strong sensory details like phosphorescent algae and salt air, enhancing mood, though the wartime context feels underexplored in relation to the basement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has potential for emotional impact and uses symbolism (lighthouse as hope), but subtext is shallow, and the ending feels predictable rather than deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on clich√©d phrases like "brazen calm" repeatedly, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but style lacks polish, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate strength, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
