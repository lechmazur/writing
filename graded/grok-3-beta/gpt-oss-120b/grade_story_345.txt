<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a lapsed priest feels surface-level; the unapologetic confusion is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the abacus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc within the word limit; jogging and snow patterns drive the story but feel repetitive without clear escalation or resolution, leaving the narrative somewhat incoherent and rushed at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard setting and dull radiance create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels underdeveloped despite the surreal imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the abacus and snow, but emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch despite thematic intent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by somewhat generic metaphors and predictable spiritual crisis tropes; while the setting is unusual, emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic, and the style prioritizes imagery over clarity, leaving the story without a lasting impression or depth.</comment>
