<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "ingeniously clueless" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to solve the riddle feels vague and lacks personal stakes, diminishing emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the doorknob and riddle resolution is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with evocative imagery of the abandoned roller coaster and haunted inns, enhancing the tone of quiet mania; sensory details are strong but occasionally overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and has layers of symbolism with the riddle and doorknob, but the ending feels anticlimactic despite a clear theme of exploration; conflict resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept and imagery, but some metaphors feel forced or generic ("heart thudding like a drum"), and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but style occasionally veers into overwrought prose, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound impact.</comment>
