<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Milo’s naivety as a gambler is evident, but his motivation feels overly abstract and lacks grounding in specific, relatable desires beyond “capturing a spark,” weakening character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed at the end with an abrupt shift to surrender; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks clarity in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, with sensory details like the sea’s whisper; however, the candlelit dinners feel underexplored in relation to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism effectively (tide as luck), but the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors (e.g., “heart cracking open”) feel overused, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but not a profound question.</comment>
