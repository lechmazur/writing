<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept of a virtual statue fragment is intriguing, the story leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like "newborn star" feel generic and overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often prioritizes ornate language over clarity; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth for a top-tier publication.</comment>
