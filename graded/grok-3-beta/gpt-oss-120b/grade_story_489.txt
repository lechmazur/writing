<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation as an unseen observer with an aggressively kind resolve feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; the first-person voice is distinct but fails to fully reveal nuanced personality or clear reasoning behind actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while the action of flinging the whistle drives a symbolic arc, pacing feels rushed, and connections between dancer, whale, and traditions are more poetic than logically coherent within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details of the haunted lighthouse and sea, enhancing the mood; however, the integration of the dancer’s timeframe with the setting feels forced and undercuts immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is mixed; strong imagery and symbolism (whale’s call, lighthouse beam) evoke some emotion, but the central conflict lacks clarity, and the ending feels more decorative than purposeful or satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overuse of generic metaphors (e.g., “wisdom flows beneath storms”) and a reliance on predictable ghostly tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion suffers from forced integration of elements; style prioritizes ornamentation over clarity, and while there’s creative intent, the story doesn’t leave a lasting thought or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
