<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the duelist’s pride and quest for forgiveness, but the portrayal lacks depth; reactions to the chest and curse feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete within constraints, with a logical beginning-to-end connection, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like server hums and maggoty imagery, strongly enhancing tone, though timeframe integration feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes bittersweet emotion and uses symbolism effectively (chest as redemption), but the ending feels slightly predictable, lacking a deeper, lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending sci-fi and familial themes, but metaphors like “dying star” feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; leaves a mild lingering thought, not profound.</comment>
