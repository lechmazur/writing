<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's rattled nature and inwardly social trait are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to entwine science with wonder feels surface-level and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with puzzles driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the postcard and the hidden room reveal lacks a strong causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lessons blend intriguingly, with sensory details like ozone and jasmine enhancing atmosphere; however, the mirrors and specters feel slightly overdone and less grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity but lacks deep emotional resonance; imagery and symbolism (dance, postcards) are present but not always impactful, and the ending feels more clever than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story shows creativity in blending elements, some metaphors (moths in a lantern) feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown; still, it avoids major clich√©s and maintains a unique tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than intentional; it leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
