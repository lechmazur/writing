<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the former game show host's past is barely reflected in personality or actions, and motivations feel generic rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and cause-effect relationships are sometimes vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details like the insect symphony, but the setting occasionally overshadows character motives, diluting emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by reliance on familiar tropes of betrayal and mystical objects; metaphors like "bitter honey" feel forced and repetitive, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overall, the story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but lacks depth and lingering impact; style is competent but not distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.</comment>
