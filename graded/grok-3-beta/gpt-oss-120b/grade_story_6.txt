<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While there are unique elements, the story leans on familiar trickster tropes without subversion; metaphors like "dragonâ€™s tooth" are generic, and emotional nuance is lacking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is somewhat cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
