<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira’s portrayal as a quiet deserter is intriguing but lacks depth in motivation; her actions with the mirror and masks feel symbolic but not fully tied to a clear personal drive beyond vague belonging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of breaking the cycle feels more conceptual than concrete, leading to a somewhat disjointed progression despite poetic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting in a plant communication study is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the atmosphere, but the connection between setting and other elements like the cracked mirror feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through symbolism and subtext, with strong imagery like the mirror and masks, but the emotional impact is diluted by abstract language and a resolution that feels more cerebral than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story shows originality in its approach to plant communication and fragmented storytelling, it occasionally leans on overused metaphors (e.g., “shards of hope”) and lacks nuanced emotional depth, feeling somewhat formulaic in its poetic style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive feel with creative use of assigned elements, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
