<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation toward self-acceptance is clear, but the apprentice's personality lacks depth beyond doubt and eventual resolution; voice feels indistinct despite internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels fragmented; reverse-engineering as action drives the story minimally, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interstellar orchard ship setting is vividly imagined with sensory details like humming trees and galactic breezes, enhancing atmosphere, though connection to character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and metaphor (nest as compass), but reliance on predictable self-discovery tropes and occasionally ornate language detracts from freshness; emotion is shown but not always nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overshadows clarity; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, though creative combinations linger mildly.</comment>
