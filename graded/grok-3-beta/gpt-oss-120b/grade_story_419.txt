<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Corin's blend of no-nonsense resolve and empathy is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation feels clear but lacks depth due to limited exploration of personal stakes or backstory within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between Corin’s actions and the broader concept of preserved traditions could be more explicitly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like whispering walls and phantom light, strongly supporting the tone and concept; however, some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone, bordering on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the ghost child’s interaction, with decent use of symbolism in the stained glass, but the theme of preserved traditions lacks deeper subtext, and the ending feels more sentimental than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids blatant clichés, some metaphors (e.g., "dying star") are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown through nuanced action or subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies; originality is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally leans toward overwrought language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not a profoundly memorable one, suggesting room for refinement.</comment>
