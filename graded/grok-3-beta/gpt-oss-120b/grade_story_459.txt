<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's unique trait of seeing ghosts as an elevator repair technician is intriguing, but her motivation to find liberation feels underdeveloped and somewhat vague, lacking depth in emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between sand castle preservation and elevator repair feels tenuous, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed ghostly encounters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is evocative and sensory details like the hum of machinery stand out, but the setting's connection to the character's ghost-seeing ability feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (sand as syllables, dried flower crown) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by overly abstract language; the ending offers resolution but lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of blending ghosts with technical work is original, some metaphors (e.g., "unfinished sighs of steel") feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style often veers into overcomplexity, obscuring clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of release but lacks sharp emotional resonance.</comment>
