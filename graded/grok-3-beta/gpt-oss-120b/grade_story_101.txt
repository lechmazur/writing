<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Milo’s welcoming nature is evident but lacks depth in action, while Lila’s motivation feels surface-level and tied too closely to the bee pin metaphor without distinct personal voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but lacks a strong arc; the detour and parade provide momentum, but the resolution feels more symbolic than earned, with pacing slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The quiet room design studio is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection to the timeframe feels tenuous and the tone of manic clarity occasionally jars with the calm setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with strong symbolism (bee pin, weathered hearts), but emotional resonance is more told than shown, and the ending feels overly poetic rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors (moths, amber glow) and a reliance on ornate language that borders on purple prose; emotional handling lacks nuanced subtext, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows cohesion in incorporating assigned elements, but the style leans too heavily on symbolism over clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
