<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; the action of overriding lab protocols is ambitious but poorly connected to the ending, with pacing issues within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthetic biology lab setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, but sensory details are uneven, and the tone of hollow recklessness occasionally clashes with the mystic's actions.</comment>
