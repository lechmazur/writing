<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's moral ambiguity is intriguing, but development feels surface-level; motivation to decode the forgotten lacks depth and personal stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven; the xerograph action is creative yet its impact on the story's progression is underwhelming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details like the market's chaos and tower's quiet, enhancing the tone of gentle chaos; setting connections to seed packets are meaningful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (seed packets as forgotten past) add depth, but emotional resonance is limited by lack of character specificity; ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors (candlelight, signal fire) are fresh, but others feel ornate; narrative lacks human nuance in character reasoning, leaning on stated rather than shown emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
