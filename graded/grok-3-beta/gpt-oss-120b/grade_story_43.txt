<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's wary nature and motivation to reclaim courage are clear, but the "loudly introverted" trait feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with the introspective tone; lacks a distinct voice beyond generic reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution; connection between meandering and the CD's discovery lacks strong cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Neon cathedral and post-human timeframe create a vivid, haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details; setting enhances the tone of crooked hope, though connection to the CD feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection through symbolism of courage and ancestry, with effective imagery; however, emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of feelings rather than nuanced showing; ending is satisfying but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in the neon cathedral concept, but metaphors like "emblem of courage" feel overused; emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than subtle subtext, risking formulaic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; length feels deliberate, though depth is somewhat surface-level, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
