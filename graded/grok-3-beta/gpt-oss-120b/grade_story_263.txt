<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coral reef city is vividly described with sensory details like neon kelp and singing arches, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting's integration with character motivation feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about morality's reflection through symbolism, but emotional impact is diluted by an overreliance on telling rather than showing, and the ending feels more clever than satisfying.</comment>
