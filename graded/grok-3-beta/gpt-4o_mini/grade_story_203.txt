<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's stage fright is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation as an exorcist confronting family lies feels surface-level and lacks depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, with the action of confronting spirits not fully driving coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is unique but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere struggles to support the tone of defiant hush or enhance Elara's motivation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Elara's resolve, but literary devices like the wildflower symbolism feel forced; the ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, metaphors like "ghost of its own" are generic; emotional handling leans on stating feelings rather than showing, and the narrative risks predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels limiting, and the overall impact lacks a lingering depth or question.</comment>
