<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Finn's stoic nature and earnest passion for radio are present, but his sudden emotional shift feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation; the voice is not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the chance encounter and emotional awakening feels forced; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The beekeeper's sanctuary is evocative with sensory details like buzzing bees and golden rays, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the characterâ€™s motivation and the paper plane feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of stoic loner finding connection without subversion; emotional handling lacks nuance, and metaphors like the plane feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
