<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Sir Alaric's weatherbeaten nature is mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or unique voice, and his motivation feels somewhat generic despite being clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end could be more impactful within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details of salt and storm enhancing the mood, though the lighthouse prison's connection to the characterâ€™s inner turmoil could be more uniquely explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through symbolism of objects, but the dialogue feels slightly forced, and the theme of regret, while present, lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar tropes of haunted pasts and stormy settings without fresh subversion; metaphors like "tarnished soul" feel overused, though emotional nuance is attempted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks the polish needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
