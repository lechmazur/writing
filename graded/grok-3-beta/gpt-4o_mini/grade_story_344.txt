<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elara’s claustrophobia and motivation to study human behavior are present but not fully explored or integrated into her actions with emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit but feels incomplete; the arc from ocean exploration to human observation is abrupt and lacks a strong causal link or compelling resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere, with sensory details like waves lapping, but the connection to Elara’s motivation and the ocean depths feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance, particularly in the tea-spilling scene, but lacks consistent subtext or a powerful central conflict; the writing shows rather than tells but isn’t particularly memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable emotional beats and generic descriptors; while not formulaic, the narrative lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist, feeling somewhat safe and conventional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but not seamlessly, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
