<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's confusion as a diplomat is evident, but her motivation lacks depth and specificity; her internal conflict feels surface-level and her voice is not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the beginning and end is somewhat forced, lacking organic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly described and complements the tone, but sensory details are uneven, and the atmosphere only partially supports Elara’s motivation, missing deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the unity metaphor, but literary devices like the bird imagery feel predictable, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying or impactful resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the metaphors (birds as unity) are overused, and emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or creative depth.</comment>
