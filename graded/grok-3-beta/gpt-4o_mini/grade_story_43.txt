<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to reclaim courage is clear, but the "loudly introverted" attribute feels underexplored and lacks distinct impact on actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; pacing is uneven with heavy introspection slowing momentum, and cause-effect links are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Neon cathedral setting is evocative with strong sensory details like fog and fireflies, but its connection to the timeframe and character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (fireflies, CD) are effective, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and imagery, but reliance on familiar tropes of lost courage and foggy redemption feels predictable; metaphors are occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward overwriting, hindering clarity; lacks lingering depth or truly innovative thought.</comment>
