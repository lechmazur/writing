<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eldrin's grumpiness is evident, but his deeper motivations and transformation feel somewhat surface-level; the reaction to the cardboard tube reveals trauma, yet his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; connections between trauma and action are present but not fully logical or impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The witch's scrying room sets an evocative tone with sensory details like incense, but the connection to stargazing and the cardboard tube feels tenuous; atmosphere supports trauma but not consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through trauma, with decent use of symbolism (mandala, tube), but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar grief tropes without subversion; metaphors like "shroud of grief" are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
