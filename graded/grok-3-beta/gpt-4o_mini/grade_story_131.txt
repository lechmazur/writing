<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's aloofness as an orphan is present but underdeveloped; her motivation to transform fear into courage feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or inner conflict. Her voice lacks distinctiveness, and reactions to objects like the stones are symbolic but not revelatory of nuanced personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (discovery), middle (reflection), and end (resolution). However, the gravitational anomaly feels disconnected from the core action of cleaning, and pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts that undermine coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The garage setting is evocative and ties to the theme of uncovering the past, but the gravitational anomaly is underutilized and feels like an odd addition. Sensory details are sparse, with only the "softly audible creak" standing out, and the atmosphere supports the mood inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through Lila's transformation, and symbolism with the stones is effective but heavy-handed. The ending feels purposeful but not fully earned. Subtext is present but lacks depth, and the writing shows rather than tells at times, though not consistently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on familiar tropes of personal transformation without subversion, and metaphors like stones as resilience feel generic. Emotional handling is more stated than nuanced, and while there are no glaring AI-like inconsistencies, the style lacks a unique voice or surprising perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic to the narrative. The style is clear but unremarkable, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a choice. It leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
