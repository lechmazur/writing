<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elara’s desire to restore the carousel, but her personality lacks depth and distinctiveness; her "eagerly unwilling" trait feels underexplored and inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between decoding the tapestry and carousel restoration is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
