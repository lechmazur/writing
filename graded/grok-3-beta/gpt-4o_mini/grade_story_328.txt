<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to connect is clear, but her "assertively meek" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the concept of technology's impact drives the story only superficially.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mirage oasis setting is evocative but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the desperate tone and motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of connection, but relies heavily on telling over showing; metaphors like "threads of gold" are overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative leans on predictable tropes of technology isolating people without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but lacks depth; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style is clear but uninspired, missing a lingering impact.</comment>
