<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lian's motivation to weave emotional honesty into her roles is clear, but her "rationally impulsive" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between solving cold-case mysteries and the emotional core feels forced, with pacing that rushes through key emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is evocative and ties well to the sunlight through debris, enhancing mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully amplify Lian's inner conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Lian's quest, with decent use of symbolism (dollâ€™s dress), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of uncovering past tragedies without subversion, and emotional descriptions occasionally feel stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but they often feel like scaffolding rather than organic components; it lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative spark to elevate it beyond average.</comment>
