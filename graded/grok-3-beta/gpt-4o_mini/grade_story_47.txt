<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's dutiful nature is evident, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; the "eagerly jaded" attribute is mentioned but not convincingly integrated into her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with auditions driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between voice notes and the resolution is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of graceless beauty, with strong sensory details like the worn glove, though some atmospheric elements feel repetitive and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara's triumph, and the theme of reframing the familiar is present, but the writing often tells rather than shows, and the ending lacks a truly impactful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a theater as a sanctuary offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of nostalgia and hidden secrets without subversion, and emotional descriptions lack nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
