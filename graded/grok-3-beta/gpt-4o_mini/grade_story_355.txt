<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's aloofness is evident, but her motivation to free unspoken truths feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her connection to the compass is symbolic but not fully explored in terms of personal impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of easing burdens through mapping dreams feels abstract and disconnected from concrete progression; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The psychedelic art installation is vividly described and supports the tone of forgotten revelry, but sensory details are somewhat generic; the atmosphere aligns with Mira’s detachment, though it lacks deeper integration with her motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mira’s journey, with decent use of symbolism (cracked compass), but the impact is diluted by overt telling of emotions rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the metaphors (e.g., compass as journey) are somewhat overused; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
