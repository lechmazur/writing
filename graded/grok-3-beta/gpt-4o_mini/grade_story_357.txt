<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's focus as a collector is clear, but her motivation to triumph over despair feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her reactions to the black rose are symbolic but not revelatory of deeper character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the party invitation driving action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between solitude and despair is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is vividly described and complements the tone of solitude, with strong sensory details of ice and shadow; however, the setting's connection to the black rose feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara's journey, with decent use of symbolism via the black rose, but the ending lacks a powerful punch, and the theme of connection over solitude feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the metaphors (e.g., frost giant as despair) are not particularly fresh, and emotional resonance relies more on stating feelings than nuanced showing; the style lacks a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel like scaffolding rather than organic components; it leaves a mild lingering thought about solitude, but creative integration is inconsistent.</comment>
