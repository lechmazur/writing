<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clara's phobia-ridden nature as a stunt double is central, but her transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation; her voice is indistinct, and reactions to fears are stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks logical depth in cause and effect, especially with the net's symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a pyramid is evocative and supports the mood, but sensory details are sparse; the atmosphere aligns with the concept of echoes, yet the setting's connection to garage sales feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Clara's triumph, but relies heavily on telling over showing; symbolism of the net is intriguing yet underdeveloped, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of self-discovery without subversion; metaphors like the net are somewhat generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but unremarkable, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
