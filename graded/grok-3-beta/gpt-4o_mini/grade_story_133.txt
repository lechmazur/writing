<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elias’s jaded nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or nuanced dialogue, and his motivation feels somewhat generic despite the intriguing gloves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but the arc feels incomplete; the transition from pottery class to studio lacks a strong causal link, and pacing feels rushed toward the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard setting is evocative with sensory details like the scent of fruit, but its connection to the action and characters’ motivations feels underdeveloped and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic gloves and art-as-weapon imagery, but emotional resonance is shallow, and the ending lacks a powerful punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable themes of reclaiming the past; metaphors like the gloves whispering power feel overused, and emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but not in a transformative way, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
