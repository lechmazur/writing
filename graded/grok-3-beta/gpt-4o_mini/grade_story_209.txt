<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to map abandoned railways is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond grief and nostalgia; the connection to the hairbrush feels somewhat forced and doesn't fully reveal nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of measuring echoes feels underdeveloped as a method to drive the story; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is evocative and supports the tone of despairing cheer, but sensory details are sparse; the connection between the setting and the water tower method feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Eli's grief, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the hairbrush and echoes is present but lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping railways through echoes is somewhat original, the emotional narrative feels predictable and leans on clich√©d grief tropes; metaphors like "chains of sorrow" are overused and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice or lingering depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
