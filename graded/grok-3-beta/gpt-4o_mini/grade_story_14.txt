<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Leo's naivety as a gambler is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to create a candle as a metaphor for fortune feels forced and lacks depth in execution. His reactions to the mold are superficial, and his voice is indistinct amidst the professors' stronger presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Leo's candle-making as a central action, but the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous within the word limit. Pacing is uneven, with rushed introspection at the close, and coherence suffers from vague cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative and ties well to the salty, turbulent atmosphere, enhancing the mood of uncertainty. Sensory details like candle wax and sea air are effective, but the timeframe of candlelit dinners feels underutilized and disconnected from deeper action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with Leo's realization, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing. Symbolism of the candle is obvious and lacks subtlety; the ending feels predictable rather than impactful, and dialogue, while present, lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on clichéd themes of gambling and redemption without fresh perspective. Metaphors like "light within" are overused, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than nuanced. The style lacks individuality, feeling formulaic at times with generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion despite incorporating assigned elements; they often feel forced rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and while there’s a lingering thought of self-reliance, it lacks depth or creative spark.</comment>
