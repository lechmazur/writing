<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Khet's fretful nature and hesitant boldness are portrayed with some clarity, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; the connection between his personality and actions feels surface-level and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of veering feels more symbolic than concrete, and the pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions that undermine coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Egyptian palace setting is evocative with sensory details like incense, but the atmosphere only partially supports the character’s motivation, and the integration of modern elements like TV subtitles feels jarring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance and uses symbolism (crumpled recipe as narrative), but the impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it lacks originality in execution; metaphors like the palace as a cage are overused, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than nuanced, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinction, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
