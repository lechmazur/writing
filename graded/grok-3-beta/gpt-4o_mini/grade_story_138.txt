<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Alaric's motivations as a forgotten noble are stated but lack depth or nuance in action. His reaction to the drone feels predictable, and his voice is indistinct, lacking a unique perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of fortifying through ticket stubs feels forced and lacks a strong causal link to the resolution. Pacing is rushed, and the arc feels incomplete within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The spontaneous combustion lab setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are present but generic, failing to fully immerse. Atmosphere supports the hollow tone but doesn't enhance the action significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; emotional resonance is attempted but feels told rather than shown. The drone metaphor is a strong device, but the ending lacks punch, and subtext is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from clich√©d themes of loss and nostalgia without subversion. Writing relies on predictable descriptors and lacks fresh imagery; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated rather than organic. Style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
