<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's amiability is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams feels surface-level and lacks specificity in action or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the crossword as a metaphor for personal growth, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly described with sensory details like salt and old wood, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and supporting Elara's introspective journey, though timeframe integration is weak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its themes of hope and resilience, with decent use of symbolism (crossword as life map), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict is understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable lighthouse-as-hope tropes without subversion; metaphors like "navigating shadows" feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
