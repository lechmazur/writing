<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Sir Alaric’s cold nature and rebellious spark are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to collect remedies feels surface-level and lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent but lacks a strong arc; the transition from collecting remedies to supporting altars feels abrupt and underdeveloped within the word limit, diminishing narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere at the deserted intersection is evocative with flickering streetlights, but the secret agent center setting is underutilized and disconnected from the mood and action, weakening world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance with the mitten and child interaction, but reliance on telling over showing (e.g., “heart began to thaw”) and lack of deeper subtext limit impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable knight-thawing trope; metaphors like “heart encased in ice” are clichéd, and emotional descriptions lack nuance, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels only partially cohesive; assigned elements are incorporated but often forced, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lasting depth.</comment>
