<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable sci-fi tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels surface-level, with stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but lacks a lingering depth or unique style; the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
