<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elian’s meekness is stated but not consistently shown through nuanced actions or dialogue, and his motivation to harness heartbreak feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end could be stronger within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it doesn’t fully transcend the constraints of its length or leave a profound lingering impact.</comment>
