<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brother Anselm's stubbornness is evident in his clinging to past symbols like the shipping label, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance; reactions to objects reveal little beyond surface-level obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with a rushed resolution; connections between beginning and end are present but lack impactful progression, and pacing struggles to balance introspection with action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aerial gondola setting enhances the sense of isolation, and the tone of cautious enchantment fits the concept, but sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse; the mountains' visual unappealing nature feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Anselm's quest, with some effective symbolism (flute, tooth marks), but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of reclaiming the past feels stated rather than shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of betrayal and revenge without subversion; metaphors like "harvesting the past" feel generic, and emotional depth is often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
