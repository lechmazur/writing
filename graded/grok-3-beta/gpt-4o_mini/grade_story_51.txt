<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marco's apologetic nature as a thug is hinted at but underdeveloped; his motivation to escape the past is clear but lacks depth in execution, and his voice feels generic despite dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of outlasting feels vague and lacks a strong causal link to staging meetings in museums, resulting in uneven pacing and coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is evocative and ties to the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the object and motivation feels superficial rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with a theme of resilience, but the symbolism of the slat is heavy-handed, dialogue feels slightly forced, and subtext is present but not richly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion, and metaphors like "weight of the past" are overused; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering impact or truly creative integration, settling for adequacy over brilliance.</comment>
