<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Celeste's role as a glamorous undertaker is intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; her struggle with artistic voice is stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between painting and the brass measuring tape feels forced, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on backstory over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dimly lit room and paint-mixing setting create a vivid atmosphere, but the social network archive feels disconnected from the sensory details, and the tone of jubilant remorse is inconsistently conveyed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional depth with jubilant remorse, but it often tells rather than shows; imagery around the measuring tape is symbolic but not fully explored, and the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a glamorous undertaker is unique, the narrative relies on predictable themes of legacy without fresh subversion, and emotional descriptions feel stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
