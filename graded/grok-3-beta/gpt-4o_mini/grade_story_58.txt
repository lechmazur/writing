<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's loyalty as a scout is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or conflicts; her motivation to learn meditation feels somewhat disconnected from her established trait, lacking depth in personal stakes or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of radicalizing fear into meaning feels vague and underdeveloped; pacing is uneven, with the ending crash disrupting the meditative resolution abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery; the setting supports the tone of sanctified dread, though its connection to meditation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara's inner journey, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery like moths as struggles is promising but not fully developed; the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable themes of inner peace without fresh subversion; metaphors like "storms within" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinction, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
