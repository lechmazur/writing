<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s empathic nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; her no-nonsense trait feels inconsistent with her emotional connection to spirits, lacking depth in motivation and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed; the connection between hammering and mollifying spirits is tenuous, and pacing suffers from abrupt shifts at key emotional moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is evocative and complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the timeframe feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through imagery of the stained glass, but the conflict is vague, dialogue feels forced, and deeper subtext is only hinted at, not explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, metaphors like “heartbeat of the past” are overused, and emotional resonance relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks clarity at times, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
