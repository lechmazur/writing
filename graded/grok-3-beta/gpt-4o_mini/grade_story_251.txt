<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambivalence as a prophet is intriguing, but her motivation to alter destiny feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her reactions to the marbles reveal little beyond surface-level sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; while the concept of the final oath shapes the narrative, the progression feels meandering and the resolution is more stated than felt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is evocative with sensory details like the hum of machinery, but its connection to the marbles and Elara’s motivation feels tenuous; the atmosphere supports the tone but lacks deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has moments of emotional resonance and uses symbolism with the marbles, but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a sharp, memorable punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the metaphors (e.g., cracked marbles as fractured heart) are somewhat generic; emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating feelings rather than evoking them through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, yet feels constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
