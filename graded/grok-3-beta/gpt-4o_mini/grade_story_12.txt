<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara’s aloofness is stated but not deeply explored through actions or nuanced dialogue, and her motivation feels more nostalgic than compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a strong arc; the transition from solitude to connection feels rushed and lacks depth within the word limit, diminishing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is underutilized, with minimal sensory detail to ground the atmosphere; the tone of eager resignation is present but not vividly supported by the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there’s some emotional resonance, the symbolism of the tile feels heavy-handed, and the dialogue lacks distinctiveness or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable emotional beats and generic imagery; metaphors like “language of the soul” feel overused, and the narrative lacks a unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive but uninspired; the elements are incorporated but not seamlessly, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
