<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Kael's impulsively thoughtful nature is hinted at but not deeply explored; his motivation to save Elara feels surface-level and lacks nuanced development within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the charcoal and the action of warning is somewhat forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the underwater setting offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar betrayal tropes without subversion, and emotional expression often feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
