<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as a traveler writing obituaries for the living is intriguing, but her rebellious nature feels more stated than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice. Motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the organ's resonance driving the story forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between mask and organ are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant's library setting is evocative and complements the tone of lucid frenzy, with sensory details like dust and echoes enhancing atmosphere. Yet, the connection between setting and timeframe (revolution) remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on choices and rebellion, with strong imagery (living tapestry, sleeping giant). However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of living fully lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of obituaries for the living is original, some metaphors (heartbeat of library) feel overused. Emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the mask and organ, leaving a lingering thought about choices. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
