<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The deputy’s impassive and personally impersonal nature is adequately portrayed, but the shift to emotional vulnerability feels abrupt and lacks deeper grounding in prior behavior or backstory, undermining authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the action of stretching and the bees’ language feels forced, and pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution that lacks impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lush orchard in an abandoned cathedral is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, but the timeframe of "during oil changes" feels disconnected and underutilized in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the deputy’s yearning for grace, and imagery is effective, but the lack of deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective limits its impact; it shows rather than tells, yet the theme feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, the emotional transformation relies on somewhat predictable patterns, and metaphors like the bees’ dance feel overused; the writing style lacks a distinct voice, leaning toward generic prose at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the orchard and bees, but the integration feels uneven, and the style occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
