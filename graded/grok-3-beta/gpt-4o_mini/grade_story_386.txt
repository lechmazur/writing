<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to bind old wounds is present but lacks depth; the time refugee's personality feels underdeveloped, with reactions to the tablecloth and stars not revealing enough unique traits or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the catapult action driving a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between past and present actions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atom-powered lighthouse setting is evocative and complements the tone of borrowed dawn, with sensory details like humming and mist enhancing atmosphere, though deeper integration with character motivation is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of belonging, with some effective symbolism (tablecloth as hope), but lacks subtext depth and a truly memorable perspective; ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but relies on familiar tropes of loss and defiance without subversion; metaphors like "beacon of hope" are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
