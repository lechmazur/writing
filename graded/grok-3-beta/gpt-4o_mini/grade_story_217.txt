<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s portrayal as an underestimated rebel is clear, but her motivations lack depth; her actions with the pocket knife feel symbolic yet underexplored in relation to her personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of intensifying resolve driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted house setting is vividly described with sensory details like mildew and nostalgia, enhancing the ephemeral gloom tone, though the connection between setting and object (pocket knife) feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of transformation, but literary devices like metaphors are somewhat clichéd, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of adapting a haunted house is intriguing, the execution relies on predictable tropes of renewal and nostalgia without fresh subversion; sensory details are generic at times, lacking unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and the impact is not particularly lingering.</comment>
