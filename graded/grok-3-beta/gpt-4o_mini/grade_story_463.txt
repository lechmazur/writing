<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to confront and reclaim the past is clear, but the dry-witted attribute feels underdeveloped and lacks distinct voice or impact on actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a sense of resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between crossing off the list and the transformation of promises is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details of salt and decay, enhancing the haunted setting; however, the timeframe's integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through symbolism of the rope, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s, but metaphors like "tapestry of resilience" feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the rope, but style occasionally leans on predictable imagery, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
