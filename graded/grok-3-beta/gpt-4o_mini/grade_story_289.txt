<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's brainy observer trait is evident, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth; her reaction to the doll is symbolic but not revelatory of complex inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of enforcing findings feels forced into the narrative, and pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay setting is vividly described and enhances the mood, but the connection to faster-than-light travel feels tangential and underexplored; sensory details are strong but selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara's transformation, but lacks deeper subtext or a memorable perspective; the ending is satisfactory but not impactful, and conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of ephemeral art is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable themes of self-discovery without subversion; sensory details are generic at times, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
