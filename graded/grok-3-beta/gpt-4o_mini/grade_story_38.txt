<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s insomnia and poetic nature are evident, but her motivations feel surface-level and lack depth; her reactions to botanical samples are symbolic but not revelatory of deeper character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; while non-violence as a concept shapes the narrative, the progression feels meandering and incomplete, with pacing that drags in introspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting is evocative and complements the tone of empty abundance, with strong sensory details like the scent of dried leaves; however, the timeframe of subway stops feels disconnected and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara’s search for meaning, with decent imagery, but lacks a strong central conflict or satisfying resolution; the theme of non-violence is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on predictable tropes of the tormented artist without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it leaves a faint lingering thought of hope, but the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
