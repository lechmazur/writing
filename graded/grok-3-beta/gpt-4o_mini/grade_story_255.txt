<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's analytical innovation is present but underdeveloped; her motivation to unearth the relic is clear, yet her personality lacks depth or a distinct voice, making her feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of untangling corruption driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and twilight setting work well to create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the scent of rain, though the connection to the timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable themes of hidden truth and justice without fresh subversion; sensory details are evocative but occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but unremarkable, and while it leaves a faint sense of hope, it lacks profound impact.</comment>
