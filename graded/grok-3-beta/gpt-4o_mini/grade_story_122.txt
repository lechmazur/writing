<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with the cyber-templar's desire to confront reality, but the "patiently frantic" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in shaping actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the action of proving and the method of light refraction is tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sky burial site setting is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character's motivation, missing deeper integration with the storm imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with the mirage of safety, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; imagery is present but lacks originality, and the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some individual style, but metaphors like "restless sea" are clich√©d, and emotional descriptions are stated rather than nuanced, suggesting a reliance on formulaic patterns over fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks sophistication, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength.</comment>
