<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation to rebel against noble expectations is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "dazed" and "rebellious" labels; his voice feels generic in dialogue, missing distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from personal rebellion to communal movement is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between messages and crowd response are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The composer's sound garden is vividly described with sensory details like melodies and dawn light, enhancing the rebellious tone, though the connection between setting and chalk as an object feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of freedom, but relies heavily on telling over showing; imagery like "cosmic dance" is intriguing yet underdeveloped, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of chalked messages offers some originality, the noble-rebel trope is clich√©d without subversion; metaphors like "music of your heart" are generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks sophistication, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
