<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation as a doomsday prepper is clear, but Marcus's transition from city planner feels underexplored; his connection to the ink blotter is symbolic but lacks depth in revealing personality. Dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the handshake driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks impact. Logical flow is present but not compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ancient Indian temple setting is evocative and supports the tone of daring caution, with some sensory detail, but its connection to the ink blotter and character motivation feels tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with authenticity and escape, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing. Symbolism of constellations and ink blotter is present but not striking. Ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some individual style but leans on generic descriptors and predictable tropes of hidden deals and fractured pasts. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral. Style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a constraint, not a choice. Lacks lingering impact.</comment>
