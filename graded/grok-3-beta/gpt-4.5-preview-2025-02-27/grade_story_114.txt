<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's apathy and laziness are well-defined, but his sudden shift to determination feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the turning point, and the connection between river wisdom and coral reefs is somewhat tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of river wisdom offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable redemption tropes, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the frames, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
