<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness as an orphan is adequately portrayed, and his motivation to transform fear into courage is clear, but his emotional shift feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper nuance or gradual progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly drives the plot effectively, and there is a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of the anomaly’s cause or aftermath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as a setting is intriguing and enhances the surreal atmosphere, with sensory details like the hum adding immersion, but the garage setting feels underutilized and lacks vivid, specific grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eli’s transformation, and the theme of adaptation is clear, but literary devices like symbolism of the stones feel predictable, and the ending lacks a truly impactful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the gravitational anomaly offers some originality, the emotional arc and metaphors (stones as resilience) lean on familiar tropes without subversion, and the writing occasionally feels formulaic with stated emotions rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly creative synthesis of elements, resulting in a competent but unremarkable piece.</comment>
