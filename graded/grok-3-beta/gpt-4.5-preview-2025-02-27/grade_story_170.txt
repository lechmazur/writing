<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Isla's free-spirited nature as an herbalist is present but underdeveloped; her motivation to heal herself mirrors her coral restoration, yet lacks depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from doubt to peace is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the connection between coral restoration and personal healing is logical yet lacks a striking causal depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The coral restoration station setting is vividly described with sensory details like ocean whispers and twilight hues, enhancing the mood of longing and healing; however, the abandoned wall feels underexplored in its atmospheric potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Isla’s journey, with decent use of symbolism (embroidery as healing), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of self-forgiveness and ancestral wisdom without subversion; metaphors like “hollow echoes” feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel like scaffolding rather than organic drivers; style is clear but lacks a distinctive edge; the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
