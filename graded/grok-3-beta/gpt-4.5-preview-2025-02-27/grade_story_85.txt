<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to seek wisdom is clear, but the swordsman's personality feels underdeveloped beyond "subtle" and lacks a distinct voice; reactions to the schematic are insightful but not deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the inventor's sudden appearance lacks foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the petrified forest is evocative and enhances the mood of stillness and mystery; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on wisdom's nature through symbolism of patterns, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; dialogue is purposeful but not particularly natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in linking wisdom to fluid patterns, but reliance on familiar tropes like the mad inventor and cryptic schematics; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering thought on wisdom, though depth is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
