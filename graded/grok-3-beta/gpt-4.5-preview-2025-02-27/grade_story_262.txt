<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the alien-teacher premise offers originality, the emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext; metaphors like the puzzle tile are somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
