<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development of Elias is adequate but lacks depth; his "thin-lipped" trait feels superficial and underutilized, while his motivation to seek knowledge is clear but not uniquely compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution of returning the artifact lacks a stronger emotional punch within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
