<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Milo's internal struggle and motivation for self-acceptance are clear, but his voice and reactions feel somewhat generic, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the connection between beginning and end is present, though not deeply impactful within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship setting is intriguing and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion; the tone of mocking affection contrasts well with the concept, yet lacks vivid reinforcement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response through Milo's journey, with decent use of symbolism (the nest), but the impact is diminished by surface-level dialogue and a lack of profound subtext or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable emotional beats and generic metaphors (e.g., "rebirth"); while the setting is unique, the narrative lacks fresh twists and shows traces of formulaic progression without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated with moderate success, yet the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
