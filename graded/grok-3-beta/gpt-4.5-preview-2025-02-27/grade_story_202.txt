<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Elias's role as a careful poisoner feels underexplored and disconnected from his actions, while his motivation tied to instinct is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the scavenger hunt method, while logical, lacks tension or stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The found object museum setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the dusty starlight tone and supporting the story's mood, though the skateboarding timeframe feels slightly incongruous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic metaphors and predictable riddle-based resolution; while the concept shows promise, the execution lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated with moderate success, yet the style and depth fall short of leaving a profound lingering impression.</comment>
