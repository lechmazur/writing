<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; Eleanor's ruthlessness as a flower arranger feels superficial and disconnected from her actions, while Marcus's polite anarchy is mentioned but not convincingly shown through behavior or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot feels incomplete with a weak arc; the action of distinguishing meaning from rock art is present but lacks a compelling progression or resolution within the tight word limit, resulting in a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and supports the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of the singer’s pause feels underutilized, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional impact or memorable subtext; dialogue is purposeful but stiff, and while there’s an attempt at symbolism with flowers and carvings, it feels forced and lacks deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and predictable patterns; metaphors like flowers as symbols are overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking originality or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
