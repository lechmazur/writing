<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as a distracted inventor is somewhat effective, with his absent-mindedness shaping his interactions with illusions, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond surface-level empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of forging illusions driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect relationships are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cyberpunk city back alley setting is vividly rendered with neon lights and grime, enhancing the mood of ruthless kindness, though sensory details could be more varied beyond visual imagery.</comment>
