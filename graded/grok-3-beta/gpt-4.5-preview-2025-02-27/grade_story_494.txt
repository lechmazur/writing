<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ren's transformation from arrogance to humility is evident, and his motivation to reclaim lost bonds is clear, but the depth of his internal conflict feels surface-level, lacking nuanced dialogue or distinct voice to fully flesh out his doubtfully confident nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from pride to reconciliation is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between seeking authorization and singing feels slightly forced, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard enhances the meditative tone and complements the harsh tenderness, with evocative moonlight imagery, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Ren's transformation and uses symbolism effectively with the tapestry, but the ending feels predictable, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural cadence; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the arrogant swordsman trope feels familiar without significant subversion; metaphors like "brittle shield" are somewhat generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans on ornate phrasing, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
