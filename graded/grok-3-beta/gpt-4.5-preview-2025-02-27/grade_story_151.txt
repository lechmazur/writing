<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's awe and motivation to create a new morality are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits, and his actions feel more symbolic than personal, limiting character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to confrontation is coherent with a clear resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the concept of moral dilemmas drives the narrative effectively, but some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a vivid, cold atmosphere that complements the tone of crystal shadows; sensory details like cracking ice are evocative, though the setting's connection to the object feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on emotion and morality with strong symbolism (veil, idol), but the ending feels slightly predictable; subtext is present, though emotional resonance relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of snowflake patterns is original, some metaphors (e.g., "infinite tapestry of stars") feel overused; emotional handling leans toward explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about emotion's role; however, the style sometimes prioritizes imagery over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
