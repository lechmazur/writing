<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between vibrations and madness lacks logical grounding, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber and cathedral window create a striking, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like shimmering glass and humming machinery, though the setting's link to madness feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on ambition's cost through vivid imagery and symbolism, but the ending feels overly dramatic, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing, diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of madness as magic offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "doorway into realms") feel generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuanced subtext, leaning on stated feelings rather than shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the map and vibrations, but over-dramatic style and rushed resolution hinder clarity and lasting impact, making the brevity feel limiting.</comment>
