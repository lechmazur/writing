<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover his identity through actors is intriguing but underdeveloped; his personality lacks depth beyond the quest, and reactions to the baseball feel more plot-driven than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the summit confrontation; cause and effect are logical, though the apocalyptic prophecy's integration is somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mysterious mountain peak and crystal shadows create a compelling atmosphere that supports the tone of forbidden knowledge; however, sensory details are sparse, and the farmers market setting feels disconnected.</comment>
