<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The puppet master's workshop is vividly described with strong sensory details like dust and varnish, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the timeframe reference feels disconnected and underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
