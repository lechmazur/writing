<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's dreamy poet nature and motivation to honor the unremembered are clear, but his transition from rebellion to quiet intensity lacks depth in execution; his actions align with motivation, yet his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of compelling remembrance driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between riddle-solving and revelation is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The disused railway station and ivy create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere that supports the tone and concept of undoing silence; sensory details are evocative, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through its theme of remembrance, with effective imagery and symbolism, but the ending feels predictable, and the conflict of overcoming silence lacks sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., ivy reclaiming space) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate brevity, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally leans toward overwrought language, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
