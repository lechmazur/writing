<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to triumph over despair is clear and consistent, and the black rose effectively symbolizes his inner struggle, but his personality lacks depth beyond solitude and oddity, resulting in a somewhat flat character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the board game driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and some cause-effect links between solitude and connection are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is vividly described with playful shadows and icy walls, enhancing the whimsical tone, but sensory details are sparse beyond sight, and the setting's connection to Elias's motivation feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias's journey, with the black rose as a strong symbol, but the dialogue is limited and lacks distinctiveness, and the theme of balance feels stated rather than deeply shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique setting, the emotional handling is more stated than nuanced, and the narrative follows a predictable transformation arc without significant subversion or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements like the frost giant's lair, but the style occasionally leans on overt exposition, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
