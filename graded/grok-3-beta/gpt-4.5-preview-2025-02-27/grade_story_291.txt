<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Captain Elias's daring nature and defiance are clear, but his internal struggle with prejudice feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance or specific backstory to ground his motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed, and the cosmic echoes as a method of confrontation are intriguing yet underexplored, leading to a lack of coherence in resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park mirror maze is evocative and ties well to the theme of reflection, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully amplify Elias's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with prejudice and defiance, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic echoes offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of self-discovery without fresh subversion, and emotional portrayal feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, missing deeper impact or lingering thought.</comment>
