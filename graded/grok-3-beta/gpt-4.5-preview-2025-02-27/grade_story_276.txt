<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jonah's unease as an emissary is clear, but his internal transformation feels somewhat predictable and lacks depth; motivation is present but not deeply explored beyond surface-level anxiety and eventual acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from unease to acceptance is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the connection between debris patterns and personal growth is logical yet not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is vividly realized and enhances the story's mood of isolation and wonder; sensory details like the rustle of postcards are effective, though more varied sensory immersion could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Jonah's journey, with decent use of symbolism (debris as redemption), but the theme of accidental wisdom feels somewhat forced and lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of debris as a metaphor for redemption shows originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of personal growth in isolation; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, limiting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the overall impact is moderate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly striking one, due to predictable thematic resolution.</comment>
