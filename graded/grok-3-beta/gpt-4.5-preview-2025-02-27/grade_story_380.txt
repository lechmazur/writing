<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Elias's identity as a convicted dream thief feels underexplored and disconnected from his actions, while his motivation to reclaim thunder is intriguing but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure shows a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between tennis and thunder, while creative, strains logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a treehouse is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of quiet mania, with strong sensory details, though the post-human timeframe feels underutilized in shaping the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elias's longing and the thunder's return, with effective imagery, but the central conflict feels somewhat abstract, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "sand through trembling fingers") feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
