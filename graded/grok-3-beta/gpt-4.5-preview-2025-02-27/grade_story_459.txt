<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, but his motivations and reactions lack depth and specificity; they feel more conceptual than personal, limiting emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between Eli's job and the ghostly encounter is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a unique and evocative setting that enhances the theme of impermanence, though sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere could be more immersive to match the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on impermanence and letting go, with effective symbolism in the sand castles and flower crown, but the emotional impact is muted by a tendency to 'tell' rather than 'show' Eli's inner transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a ghost-seeing technician and sand castle lab offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "elegant clumsiness") feel overused, and emotional descriptions lack nuanced subtext, bordering on generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the lab and ghosts, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
