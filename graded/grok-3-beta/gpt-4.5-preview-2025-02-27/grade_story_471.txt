<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elias’s recklessness and motivation to map ghost towns are present, but his transformation feels surface-level and predictable, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the forgotten promise and the musicians’ role is underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The misty forest and abandoned funfair create a haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details like curling mist and rusted rides, effectively supporting the tone and character’s mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through the theme of forgotten promises, but reliance on explicit statements over subtext and a somewhat predictable ending diminish overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of haunted pasts and ghostly settings without significant subversion; metaphors like “ghostly embrace” feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
