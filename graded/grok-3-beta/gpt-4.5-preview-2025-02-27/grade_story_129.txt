<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to break generational curses is clear, but his personality as a somber troubadour feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions beyond the symbolic act of singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "torpedo" feels forced and metaphorical rather than integral, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned rocket launch site is evocatively described with sensory details, enhancing the melancholic atmosphere, but its connection to empathy and the timeframe of transformation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
