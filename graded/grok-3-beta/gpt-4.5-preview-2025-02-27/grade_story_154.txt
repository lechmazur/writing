<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ewan's frazzled nature and motivation to track social changes are clear, but his personality lacks depth and distinct voice; his transformation feels more plot-driven than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with levitation as a climactic action, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between tracking legends and the ritual's outcome is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Celtic village setting is vividly described with sensory details and complements the tone of jubilant despair, though the connection between setting and object could be more integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Ewan's transformation and uses symbolism effectively, but the theme of courage feels heavy-handed and lacks nuanced subtext; the ending is satisfying but not deeply impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (e.g., "fire of courage") are generic, and emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing; originality is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the ink pot and levitation, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
