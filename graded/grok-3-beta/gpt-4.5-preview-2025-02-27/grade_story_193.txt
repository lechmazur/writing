<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Eliasâ€™s exile and loneliness are stated rather than deeply explored through nuanced actions or internal conflict, making motivations feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, undermining the impact of the resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with the snowstorm and abandoned customs office effectively enhancing the mood of isolation and eventual connection through vivid sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotion through companionship, but reliance on explicit statements of feeling rather than showing through subtext diminishes impact; dialogue feels functional but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes of exiled royalty and miraculous healing objects; emotional resonance feels stated rather than earned through nuanced detail or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it combines elements competently but without a lingering, profound impact or innovative style.</comment>
