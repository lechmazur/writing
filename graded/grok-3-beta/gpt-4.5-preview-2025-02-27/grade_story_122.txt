<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the cyber-templar's obsessive drive to defy nature, but the portrayal lacks depth beyond surface-level determination; internal conflict is stated rather than explored through nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, driven by the action of proving defiance, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a vivid, fitting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like lightning and rain, but the connection between setting and object (bridle) feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of fleeting triumph and human defiance, with strong imagery and symbolism (prisms, bridle), but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of feelings rather than showing through subtler subtext; ending is purposeful but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a cyber-templar and prism-lightning is inventive, some descriptors (e.g., "euphoric agitation") feel repetitive and forced; emotional handling lacks nuance, leaning on explicit statements over layered reactions, though the style shows individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like prisms and storms, leaving a lingering sense of human struggle, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
