<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Ezra's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; they feel more like a plot device than a fully realized personal drive. His voice is indistinct, and reactions to events are surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between infiltrating secret clubs and digital cleansing is tenuous, lacking clear cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned settings (music hall and mess hall) are evocative with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of indifferent enthusiasm, and the connection to character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with digital cleansing, but it lacks emotional resonance and subtext; much is told rather than shown, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on clich√©d themes of digital detox without fresh perspective; metaphors like "quietly loud" are overused and generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While some assigned elements are integrated, the story lacks cohesion and depth; the style is clear but uninspired, and it fails to leave a lingering impact or showcase significant creative thinking.</comment>
