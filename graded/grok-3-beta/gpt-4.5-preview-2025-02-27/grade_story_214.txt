<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the pursuit of radiance from doubt, tied to loss, but the lone trapper's personality lacks depth beyond determination; reactions to sea glass are symbolic but not revelatory of nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with decoding microfilm driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; logical flow is maintained, though the black hole's resolution is more implied than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the floating observatory enhances isolation and purpose, with evocative cosmic imagery; sensory details like the hum and starlight are effective, though smell and taste are absent, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a reflective mood with themes of transformation, and sea glass symbolism is strong, but emotional impact is somewhat surface-level; conflict is present but lacks sharp tension or a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining cosmic and personal loss themes, but metaphors like "black hole of doubt" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and tone shifts are occasionally uneven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like sea glass and the observatory, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought of transformation, though not powerfully so.</comment>
