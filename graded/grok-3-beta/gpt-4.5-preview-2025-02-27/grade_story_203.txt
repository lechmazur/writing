<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's stage fright is a compelling trait, but its integration into his role as an exorcist feels underdeveloped; his motivation to overcome fear is clear, yet his internal conflict lacks depth due to limited exploration within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the action of confronting the entity drives the story, though some cause-effect links are superficially addressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of isolation, but sensory details are sparse; the tone of defiance contrasts well with the cold vacuum, yet the setting's potential to enhance the action remains underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias's triumph, with effective symbolism in the wildflowers and toy assembly; however, the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the theme of courage, while present, lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story offers a unique premise with the exorcism in space, but relies on familiar tropes of overcoming fear without significant subversion; metaphors like "defiant hush" are fresh, yet some emotional descriptions lean toward stating rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is modest due to limited depth in character and theme.</comment>
