<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Elian’s “desperately casual” trait feels forced and inconsistently portrayed, while his transition to empathy is intriguing but lacks depth in motivation due to limited exploration of past experiences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, and the connection between heartbreak and plot progression is somewhat surface-level within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly described with sensory details that enhance atmosphere, effectively supporting the tone of optimistic desperation, though the timeframe’s integration feels more poetic than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes emotion through heartbreak and empathy themes, with strong imagery, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a deeper punch due to limited subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of empathy through visions is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., “fireflies” for memories) are overused, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it lacks the profound depth or lingering impact needed for top-tier publication; style supports clarity but doesn’t fully elevate the narrative.</comment>
