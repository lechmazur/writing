<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape stagnation is clear, and the wreck-diver/ghost whisperer traits align with confronting past ghosts, but the emotional depth feels surface-level; the first-person voice lacks distinctiveness and nuance in reaction to the grandmother's ghost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from regret to resolution is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is logical, yet pacing suffers from abrupt emotional shifts, and the action of arousing courage lacks detailed buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly described with sensory details like faded targets and moonlight, enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting the character’s motivation, though the connection to the timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the grandmother’s dialogue and the thawing heart metaphor, but the impact is diminished by overt telling of emotions rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the metaphors (amber as stagnation, thawing heart) feel somewhat predictable and overused; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, and the style lacks a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a mild lingering feeling of freedom, though not profoundly thought-provoking.</comment>
