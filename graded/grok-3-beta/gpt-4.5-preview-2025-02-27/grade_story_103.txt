<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's weatherbeaten nature is reflected in his physical description and past choices, but his motivations lack depth beyond regret; his internal conflict feels stated rather than shown through nuanced action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the story struggles to fully integrate the concept of impossible choices into a cohesive driving force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is evocative and enhances the tone of isolation, with sensory details like flickering torches and crashing waves adding atmosphere; however, some connections between setting and character motivation feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through Aldric's struggle and uses strong symbolism with mirrors and objects, but the ending feels predictable, and the theme of regret is heavy-handed rather than subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like the serpent knocker and shattered mirrors feel somewhat generic; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking the nuanced subtext expected of top-tier work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans toward overwrought prose, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly unique.</comment>
