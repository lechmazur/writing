<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation to restore his family legacy is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "broke aristocrat" trope; his actions align with the motivation, yet his voice and reactions feel somewhat generic and predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between harmonizing recipes and legacy restoration is logical yet not fully developed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone and complements the theme of legacy's burden; sensory details like creaking planks and faded candy aromas are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Edmund's realization about legacy, but the ending feels somewhat predictable; symbolism of the orchid candy is present yet lacks deeper subtext or layers of meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on familiar gothic and redemption tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like "skeletal remains" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with the assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
