<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's pursuit of butterflies symbolizing unconventional love, but his personality as a "wayward apothecary" lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions to the highlighter pen feel symbolic but not revelatory of deeper traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, driven by Morse code communication, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between doubt and resolution are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details like "liquid sapphire" and "brass-rimmed portholes," enhancing the atmosphere of battered marvel and supporting the theme of resilient love, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the metaphor of butterflies and love's resilience, with a satisfying ending, but subtext is somewhat heavy-handed; conflict resolution via Morse code feels purposeful yet lacks nuanced emotional "showing" over "telling."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the steampunk-butterfly-love combination offers some originality, metaphors like "wings flickering like embers" feel slightly overused; emotional handling is more stated than nuanced, and tone shifts are occasionally abrupt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, leaving a lingering thought about love's resilience, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
