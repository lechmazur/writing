<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Elias’s insomnia and poetic nature shaping his restless, introspective personality, but his motivation to embrace non-violence feels slightly underdeveloped and lacks deeper nuance in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the transition from guilt to resolution via after-parties is rushed and lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway stops create a compelling, moody atmosphere that enhances the theme of whispers and warnings, though sensory details are inconsistently vivid and sometimes generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through Elias’s journey and uses symbolism effectively with botanical samples, but the ending feels slightly predictable and dialogue lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements, metaphors like “silent poem of survival” feel overused, and emotional depth occasionally relies on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
