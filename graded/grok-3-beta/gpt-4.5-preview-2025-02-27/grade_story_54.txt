<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve hunting techniques is clear, but Elias's even-tempered nature feels underexplored in action; his systematically rebellious trait lacks depth in execution beyond stated intent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the action of offloading the scarf drives the story, though cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of vibrations of intent is intriguing, the narrative leans on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable rebellion tropes; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown with subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though creative integration of elements feels forced at times.</comment>
