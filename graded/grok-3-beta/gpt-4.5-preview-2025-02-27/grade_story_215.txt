<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Father Elias's inwardly social nature and rattled state are present, but their impact on his actions feels surface-level; motivation to entwine science and wonder is clear but lacks deeper emotional resonance or distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically through puzzles unlocking a hidden room, with a discernible arc within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between dance lessons and the core mystery remains tenuous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lessons create an intriguing backdrop, with some sensory detail like music echoes; yet, the atmosphere lacks depth in evoking mood or enhancing character motivation, missing richer sensory immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of faith versus science, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; dialogue feels functional but not natural, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a memorable punch or subtextual weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality in blending exorcism with psychic research, the execution leans on predictable mystery tropes without subversion; language is clear but lacks a unique style, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the brief length feels like a constraint, not a choice, and while thereâ€™s creative intent, the lingering impact or depth is limited.</comment>
