<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elwin's gentle nature as a conjurer is evident in his actions, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a generic desire for justice; his personality feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the action of reassembling and the broader justice theme is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground city is vividly described with glowing crystals and carvings, enhancing the atmosphere, but sensory details are uneven, and the tone of joyful terror occasionally clashes with the setting's somber mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of restoration, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the butterflies is present but not deeply layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of stained glass butterflies is unique, the narrative leans on fantasy tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions feel stated rather than nuanced; writing style lacks a distinct individual voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; it lacks a lingering depth or question, and the style is functional but not striking.</comment>
