<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's vigilance and punctuality shape his actions effectively, and his motivation tied to personal tragedy is clear, but his emotional depth feels surface-level, lacking nuanced reactions or a distinct voice beyond sardonic wit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of demonstrating drives the story forward, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links, like Marlowe’s sudden confession, lack buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is an intriguing setting, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the sardonic tone or Elias’s motivation, missing opportunities to deepen the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias’s vindication, and the peacock pattern symbolism is a nice touch, but the conflict resolution feels too neat, and the writing lacks subtext or a truly memorable style.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the conspiracy trope feels predictable without subversion, and emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; metaphors like pruning shadows are somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but unremarkable, and while there’s a lingering sense of closure, it lacks profound depth or impact.</comment>
