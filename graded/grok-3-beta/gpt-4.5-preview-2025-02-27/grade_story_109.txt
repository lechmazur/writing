<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aldric's cold nature and yearning for warmth are well-established, and his motivation to preserve folk remedies aligns with his lawful rebellion, but his emotional shift feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance in expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of supporting others driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some moments are rushed, and the connection between artistic awakening and plot resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The late-night deserted intersection sets a strong melancholic tone that complements Aldric's internal struggle, and sensory details like breath in chill air are evocative, though the secret agent center feels underexplored and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the mitten and Aldric's awakening, with some effective symbolism, but the theme of quiet rebellion lacks deeper subtext, and the ending, while purposeful, doesn't fully resonate or linger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements, the emotional portrayal often states feelings rather than showing nuanced reactions, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc without surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but the style occasionally leans on overt exposition, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound question or feeling to carry beyond the text.</comment>
