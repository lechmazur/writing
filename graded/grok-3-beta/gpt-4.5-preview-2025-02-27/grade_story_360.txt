<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's meekness as a necromancer is intriguing, but his motivation to decode a universal riddle feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in personal stakes; his personality doesn't distinctly shape his actions beyond quiet observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the revelation; cause and effect are logical, though the universal riddle's impact on the plot lacks specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with sensory details like lantern light and playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone; however, the setting's connection to Elias's motivation feels somewhat superficial beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Elias's quiet revelation, and the dew drop reflection is a strong symbol, but the theme of interconnected beauty feels stated rather than shown; the ending is satisfying but lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on a necromancer's humility, avoiding overt clich√©s, and metaphors like the dew drop are specific; however, some descriptions (e.g., "tangled tapestry") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the broken pen and dew drop, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate phrasing, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
