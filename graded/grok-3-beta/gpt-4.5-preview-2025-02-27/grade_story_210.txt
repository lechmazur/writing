<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's amiability and scholarly nature are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to fuse lore with dreams feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from waiting room to lighthouse revelation, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like salt air and creaking timbers, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery; however, the waiting room timeframe feels underutilized in contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias's transformation, with decent imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; it shows more than tells, yet the theme feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of haunted settings and scholarly discovery without fresh subversion; metaphors like "navigating shadows" feel somewhat generic, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
