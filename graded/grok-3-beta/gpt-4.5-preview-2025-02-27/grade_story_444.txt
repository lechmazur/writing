<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora’s fierce resolve as an ambassador is clear, but her motivation to indoctrinate feels somewhat abstract and lacks personal depth; her connection to the ghost costume is evocative but underdeveloped in revealing nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of indoctrination driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on imagery, while key motivations remain vague; coherence is maintained, though cause and effect are not always sharply defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like radio static and phosphorescent algae, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; the tone of calm frenzy complements the concept of shared dreams, though the setting’s connection to the object feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood through symbolism of the ghost costume and shared dreams, with a satisfying ending; however, the central conflict feels understated, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with the sunken zeppelin and shared dreams, some metaphors (e.g., “tapestry of illusions”) feel generic; emotional resonance is attempted but lacks nuance, and the tone occasionally shifts unnaturally between fierce and gentle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, clarity is sometimes hindered by ornate language, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a truly piercing question or feeling.</comment>
