<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's hardheadedness and brokenness are present but underdeveloped; her motivation for healing feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the library discovery, and the connection between the gallery and library segments is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The snowy setting and ephemeral gallery create a strong atmosphere of transience that supports the tone and concept; sensory details like snow and cold air are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of surrender over control, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable imagery; the ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable themes of power's cost without fresh subversion; emotional portrayal is more told than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a deliberate brevity, but the integration of elements feels somewhat forced; it leaves a lingering thought about balance, though not powerfully so.</comment>
