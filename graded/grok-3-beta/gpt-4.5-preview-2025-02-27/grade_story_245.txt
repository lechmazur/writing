<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for redemption is clear, but Jarek's personality feels underdeveloped beyond the smuggler archetype; dialogue lacks a distinct voice, sounding generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; connection between tea leaf patterns and hidden waterfalls is tenuous, lacking logical depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport setting is evocative with sensory details like "cracked tarmac," but atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional weight of redemption or guilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through themes of regret, but symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) feels forced; ending lacks lasting impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; metaphors like "heart's revolt" are overused, and emotional portrayal leans on stating rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but uninspired; elements are integrated but feel like scaffolding rather than organic components; lacks a lingering thought or unique depth.</comment>
