<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the undertaker's determination to imprison darkness, but the weary attribute feels underexplored in shaping personality beyond surface-level fatigue; lacks distinct voice or deeper nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of imprisoning drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between clock and darkness are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the ancient Persian palace is vividly described and enhances the mystical tone, with strong sensory details like faded murals and moonlight; however, the car backfire timeframe feels disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the undertaker's resolve, with some effective symbolism in the clock, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending is satisfying but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "absolute dark" feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuanced depth; style is functional but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the clock and sun paths, but style occasionally leans on repetitive phrasing ("silence" overused), and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
