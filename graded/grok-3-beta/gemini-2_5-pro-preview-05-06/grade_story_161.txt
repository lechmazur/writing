<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's vigilant nature and past as an orchardist shape her meticulousness, but her transition to paper airplane folding lacks deeper emotional grounding; motivation feels surface-level despite the tragedy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the demonstration driving the climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between orchard blight and facility failures are intriguing yet underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is vividly rendered and supports the action well; sensory details like the hangar’s hum enhance atmosphere, though the tone occasionally wavers between sardonic and overly dramatic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its conspiracy theme and peacock mosaic symbolism, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending satisfies yet lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the premise is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "grim, satisfying click") feel generic; emotional resonance is present but not nuanced enough; the narrative avoids clichés but lacks a fully distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering question about the conspiracy, though depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
