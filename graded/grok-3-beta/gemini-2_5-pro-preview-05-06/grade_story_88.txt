<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unit 734’s motivation to archive human stories is clear and consistent, shaped by its mathematically poetic attribute, but its personality lacks depth or a distinct voice beyond the assigned traits, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit with a discernible arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between the child’s language spark and the retreat lacks stronger causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Sumerian palace setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of reverence, paired well with the tone of shouting silence, though sensory details beyond sight are underutilized, missing deeper immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a toaster AI is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “screaming choirs”) feel overused, and the narrative occasionally leans on ornate language that borders on purple prose, detracting from authenticity.</comment>
