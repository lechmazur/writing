<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s stage fright is integrated into her character as a recurring tremor, but her motivation as an exorcist feels underdeveloped; it lacks depth beyond the inherited lies concept, making her actions feel somewhat disconnected from a personal core.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the key turning as a clear inciting action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between toy assembly and the exorcism ritual is tenuous, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly described as a metallic graveyard, enhancing the tone of isolation and defiance, and sensory details like the cold vacuum are effective; however, the integration of toy assembly feels slightly discordant with the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara’s struggle, and symbolism with the toy astronaut and wildflower is present, but the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks deeper subtext or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and exorcism, avoiding overt clichés, with fresh imagery like “sculpt possibility from ashes”; however, some metaphors feel forced, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative integration of elements like orbital debris and wildflowers, but the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, and the lingering impact is muted by an underdeveloped emotional core.</comment>
