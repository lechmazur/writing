<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alabaster’s telepathic nature and motivation to seek truth are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the tragic-joyful dichotomy; reactions and actions align with motivation but feel predictable and underdeveloped for a character of such unique potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with the action of influencing the calligrapher, showing a clear arc within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like coal smoke and automaton clangs, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness; yet, the setting’s integration with the hair tie feels tenuous, slightly undermining atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the theme of hidden truth, supported by decent imagery and symbolism; however, the ending lacks punch, and the conflict resolution feels more suggestive than satisfying within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining a living statue with telepathy and calligraphy as a method of rebellion; still, some metaphors (e.g., "tragically joyful hope") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance could be deeper rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels intentional; however, it lacks a truly lingering impact or profound depth, settling for a promising but not fully realized narrative spark.</comment>
