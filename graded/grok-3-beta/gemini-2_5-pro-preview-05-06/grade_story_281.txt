<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finn’s transformation from a cynical pickpocket to someone seeking deeper meaning is intriguing, but his motivations shift too abruptly without sufficient internal conflict or gradual progression to fully convince.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from hiding to transformation feels somewhat complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven; the poetry sessions as a plot driver feel forced at times, lacking deeper causal integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is evocatively described with sensory details that enhance the eerie mood, effectively supporting the transformation concept, though the connection to Finn’s past life feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through Finn’s change, with strong imagery and subtext around transformation, but the dialogue from Sparks feels overly cryptic, diminishing natural impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of poetic transformation is original, the execution occasionally leans on generic descriptors and predictable ghostly tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is present but not consistently deep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question of transformation, but uneven pacing and forced integration of poetry sessions hinder overall clarity and impact.</comment>
