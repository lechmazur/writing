<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leo's eagerness as a lookout is clear, and his motivation to find connection is consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; reactions to the sewing box are predictable, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the poltergeist activity driving progression, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the end—and some cause-effect links, like the sudden levitation, lack grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman villa enhances the eerie tone and supports the poltergeist concept well, with sensory details like whispers on marble, but the atmosphere's connection to Leo’s digital-age motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through shared discovery, and the ending is purposeful, but literary devices are uneven—some imagery is evocative, yet subtext about connection feels heavy-handed rather than layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality in combining poltergeist activity with a sewing box, some descriptors like “technically organic” feel forced and overly complex; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a mild lingering thought, lacking deeper impact.</comment>
