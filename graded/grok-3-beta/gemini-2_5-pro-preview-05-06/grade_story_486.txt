<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to hush the crowd and critique the council is clear, and his clumsily dexterous attribute shapes his interaction with equipment, but his personality lacks depth or a distinct voice beyond the functional; his reactions to the stained glass fragment feel utilitarian rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the critique driving the narrative forward logically via pantomime confessions; pacing is mostly effective, though the buildup feels slightly rushed, and coherence holds despite minor abruptness in transitioning to the rooftop scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and timeframe of a hushed, erased chalkboard complement the tone of silent retribution well; sensory details like humming resonators and ghostly figures are evocative, though the setting's connection to the broader city atmosphere could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response with its silent critique and has satisfying resolution; imagery like "freshly erased chalkboard" is effective, but subtext is underdeveloped, and the central conflict, while present, lacks nuanced emotional stakes beyond the surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of silent retribution via sonic illusions is original, and metaphors like "metallic vines" are fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable tropes of corruption exposure without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like sound manipulation, and the brief length suits the focused concept; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
