<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s cunning and morally ambiguous nature are evident in his lock-picking and ambitious pursuit, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level desire for power; his voice feels somewhat generic and lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from impulse to discovery, driven by the sudden urge and xerographing action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and some causal links (e.g., intuition guiding him) are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower setting is intriguing and ties to the botanical mystery, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully amplify the tone of gentle chaos or Alistair’s inner conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of legacy and power but often tells rather than shows emotion; imagery (e.g., symbols shifting under copier light) is evocative, yet the ending feels more predictable than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of forgotten botanicals is unique, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of discovery and ambition without fresh subversion; language occasionally veers into ornate territory, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style leans toward overwriting, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a strength; it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual resonance.</comment>
