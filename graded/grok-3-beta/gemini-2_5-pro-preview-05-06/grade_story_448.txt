<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of magical liberation is somewhat original, the narrative leans on familiar mage tropes without subversion; language is occasionally ornate, and emotional nuance is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements, but they often feel like scaffolding rather than organic drivers; style is clear but not distinctive, and the brief length limits deeper impact or lingering questions.</comment>
