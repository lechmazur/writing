<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to rescue lost knowledge is clear and consistent, and her alien nature as a disguised teacher shapes her intense focus, but her "righteously flawed" attribute feels underexplored in action, lacking depth in how it impacts her decisions or relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the organ’s reverberation driving the discovery, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the beginning and end lacks emotional weight or a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Roman bathhouse reborn as a concert hall is evocative and ties well to the action, with sensory details like mosaic-lined halls enhancing mood, but the atmosphere could better reflect Elara’s inner conflict and the timeframe’s specificity feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about forgotten knowledge, and imagery like the shimmering wall is effective, but the emotional impact is shallow, lacking deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending; conflict resolution feels predictable within the tight limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise of an alien teacher is intriguing, the execution leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion, and emotional portrayal often states rather than shows; metaphors like “heart a frantic drum” are somewhat generic, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style lacks polish for clarity and impact; it leaves a faint lingering curiosity about lost cultures, yet lacks profound depth or resonance.</comment>
