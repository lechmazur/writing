<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's grumpiness and role as a crypt caretaker are evident, but his internal struggle with trauma feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper insight into his past or specific sorrows beyond vague references.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is somewhat clear with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the focus on the mandala and tube overshadows a more concrete progression of Alistair's internal uprising.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, mystical atmosphere that complements the tone of grandiose subtlety; sensory details like starlight and shifting sands are evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative mood with some effective imagery and symbolism (mandala as trauma), but the ending feels more descriptive than impactful, lacking a deeply satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of trauma and mandala patterns offers originality, some descriptions (e.g., "crushed night") border on purple prose, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the mandala and tube, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate language, and the depth feels slightly superficial.</comment>
