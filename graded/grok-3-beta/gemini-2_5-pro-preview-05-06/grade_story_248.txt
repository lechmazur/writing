<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to clear a misguided prophecy is clear, but his "unsteady" and "coyly furious" traits feel inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how they shape his actions beyond surface descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by reassembling letters, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the prophecy and the cosmic collision lacks full logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned space freighter docking bay and colliding worlds create a vivid, tense atmosphere that enhances the narrative; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of dread and resolution, with some effective imagery, but the dialogue feels stilted, and the emotional impact relies too heavily on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the narrative leans on predictable sci-fi tropes without subversion, and the language occasionally veers into overly ornate prose, detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the style occasionally obscures clarity with overwrought descriptions.</comment>
