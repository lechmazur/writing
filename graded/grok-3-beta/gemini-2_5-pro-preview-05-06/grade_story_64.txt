<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s uncertainty as an alchemist is evident, but her motivation to map forests feels underdeveloped and disconnected from her immediate actions during the trial. Her interaction with the scale lacks depth in revealing personality, and her 'voice' is not distinctly conveyed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with safeguarding knowledge as a clear action driving the narrative. However, pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the trial and her mapping ambition is tenuous, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, complementing the tone of mundane miracles. Sensory details like the hush and sighing balloons are effective, though the scale’s connection to the setting feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild reflection on legacy versus immortality, with some effective imagery around the scale and stone. However, the central conflict of the trial feels underdeveloped, the ending lacks punch, and emotions are often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of coded scuffs is original, the writing occasionally leans on generic descriptors and predictable patterns around immortality. Emotional nuance is limited, and the style feels somewhat formal, lacking a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral. The style is clear but not striking, and while there’s a lingering idea of legacy, the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
