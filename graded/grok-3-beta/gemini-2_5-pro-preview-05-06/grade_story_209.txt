<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation as a seasoned woodsman mapping railways as penance is clear and tied to personal loss, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond grief; the hairbrush connection to Elara reveals depth, yet his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The short-circuit action drives a pivotal emotional shift, and the story achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy exposition early on; logical flow is maintained, though the water tower method feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like “metallic sunflowers” and ozone scent, enhancing the despairing tone; however, the connection between setting and hairbrush feels tenuous, slightly undermining atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through Silas’s confession, with strong imagery like “phantom beep”; subtext about grief and silence adds depth, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the brief scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and emotional arc, some metaphors like “morning mist” feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown; overall style is individual but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the radio wave garden, and the brevity feels deliberate; it leaves a lingering sadness, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
