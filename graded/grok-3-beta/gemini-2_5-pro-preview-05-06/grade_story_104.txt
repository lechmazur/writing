<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's stoicism is present but not deeply explored; his motivation to defy conformity feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict, limiting depth in character portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; while the action of venerating the cameo drives the narrative, the story feels more like a vignette than a complete structure with clear progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of façades, but sensory details are sparse, and the harvest day timeframe feels underutilized in enhancing mood or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers some subtext about individuality, but emotional impact is muted due to reliance on telling over showing; the theme of defiance is present but not fully developed or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of cracks in the façade is intriguing, the writing leans on repetitive phrases like "honestly rare" and lacks fresh metaphors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with overworked imagery; it leaves a lingering idea of rebellion but lacks the depth for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
