<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas's dry wit is present but underdeveloped, with only a single line hinting at it; his motivation to learn traditional methods is clear but lacks depth or personal stakes, feeling more functional than compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the dance as a method driving the resolution logically, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom is vividly atmospheric and supports the tone of sorrow and recklessness, with sensory details like dust motes and moonlight enhancing mood; however, deeper integration of setting with action is lacking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the dance of despair, and the ending feels purposeful, but literary devices are underutilized, and the theme of eroding promises lacks deeper subtext or layers beyond the surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story avoids blatant clich√©s and shows some ingenuity in using dance as a spectral resolution method, but the writing occasionally leans on generic descriptors, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the style lacks the polish or depth for top-tier impact; it leaves a lingering mood but not a profound thought or question.</comment>
