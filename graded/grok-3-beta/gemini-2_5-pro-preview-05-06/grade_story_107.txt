<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rex's transformation from cynicism to trust is intriguing, but his motivations feel somewhat inconsistent—his initial paranoia lacks depth, making his shift to collaboration feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the sudden illness and meeting with Lyra are rushed, weakening cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>
