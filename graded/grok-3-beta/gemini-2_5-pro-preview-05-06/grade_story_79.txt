<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sheriff Brody's motivation to defy grief through celestial research is intriguing, but his personality lacks depth beyond resolve; his actions align with motivation but feel somewhat detached from a fully fleshed-out character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a subtle arc within the word limit, with tracing stars as a symbolic rebellion, but pacing feels uneven—lingering on imagery over progression—and coherence is occasionally disrupted by abstract transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library and midday lull create a unique, evocative atmosphere that enhances the tone of ghostly resolve; sensory details like dust motes are effective, though some connections between setting and action feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through symbolism of falling stars and loss, with strong imagery, but the impact is muted by a lack of sharp conflict or a fully satisfying resolution; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of celestial rebellion is original, some metaphors (e.g., "tear of a god") verge on clichéd, and emotional expression occasionally feels stated rather than shown; the style is distinct but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the library and stars, leaving a lingering sense of fragile hope, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity, and the short length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
