<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as a professional cuddler shapes her initial discomfort with imperfection, but her motivation to overcome prejudice feels slightly underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her internal shift is clear but lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to fully reveal her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and internal resolution within the word limit, and decay drives the thematic progression; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect relationships between Elara’s past and present could be more explicitly linked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly rendered with sensory details like rust and floral scents, enhancing the theme of decay and Elara’s prejudice; the atmosphere supports the mood well, though the timeframe of the hush before a speech feels somewhat underutilized as a narrative anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Elara’s internal shift and uses effective symbolism with the phantom train ticket punch; however, the conflict feels small-scale and underexplored, and the theme of transformation, while present, lacks deeper subtext or a truly lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in combining decay and a professional cuddler, with fresh metaphors like crumbling plaster; yet, it occasionally leans on predictable emotional descriptors and lacks a truly surprising twist, with Elara’s transformation feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with the assigned elements, showing creative integration of decay and unspoken rules; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
