<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Father Michael’s rattled nature and inward sociability are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to entwine science with wonder feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the puzzle-solving driving progression, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between dance lessons and the final revelation is tenuous, lacking deeper integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility is evocative, with sensory details like thumping bass and sweat enhancing atmosphere, but the tone of coy aggression feels inconsistently applied, and the setting’s potential to amplify horror is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts some thought on science versus wonder, but the emotional impact is muted by a clinical ending; imagery and tension are present but lack depth, and the theme feels more stated than explored through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable exorcist tropes without subversion; sensory details are decent but not striking, and emotional nuance is limited, with feelings often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but their integration feels somewhat forced; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
