<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's frantic nature and motivation to expose illusions are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the obsession; reactions to discoveries feel predictable rather than revealing nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the banquet as a climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between discoveries and actions are somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The earthquake facility setting is intriguing and ties to the concept, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the frenzied tranquility tone beyond surface descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about reality and deception, with some subtext, but lacks emotional depth; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and "showing" over "telling" is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution relies on conspiracy tropes without subversion; language occasionally veers into purple prose, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it leaves a lingering question about reality, yet lacks the polish and depth for top-tier impact.</comment>
