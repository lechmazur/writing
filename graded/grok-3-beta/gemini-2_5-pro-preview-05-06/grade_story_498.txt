<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the narrative avoids overt clich√©s, the language occasionally leans on generic descriptors; emotional handling shows nuance in places but lacks consistent depth or a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like seeds and gardens, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
