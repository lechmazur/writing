<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to seize the horizon’s promise is clear, but his "kindly" nature feels underexplored in action, and his "loyally disloyal" trait lacks deeper nuance or conflict beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the repetitive focus on measuring cloud-stuff feels static and fails to build toward a meaningful climax or change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating island cloud cafe and soft edges of time create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s potential to enhance the action or motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (measuring spoon as divining rod) are striking, but the story lacks emotional depth or a satisfying ending; it leans on telling over showing, diminishing impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive in tone but lacks depth or lingering impact; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a strength, and the elements overpower a discernible narrative arc.</comment>
