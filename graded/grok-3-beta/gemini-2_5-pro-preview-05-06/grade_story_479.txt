<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular purpose; her glamorous undertaker persona feels more descriptive than integral to her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc of elongating a digital ghost is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional or thematic punch to achieve completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is evocative and complements the tone of jubilant remorse, with strong sensory contrast between sterile digital and ancient ritual; however, sensory details are unevenly applied and could be more immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of resisting digital sameness, with effective imagery like “vibrant bloom in the sterile garden,” but the conflict feels understated, and the ending lacks a lasting impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of digital soul restoration is original, some metaphors (e.g., “digital catacombs”) feel familiar, and the emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing; the style is distinct but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the brass measuring tape, but the style borders on overly ornate, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a thought about human complexity, though not powerfully lingering.</comment>
