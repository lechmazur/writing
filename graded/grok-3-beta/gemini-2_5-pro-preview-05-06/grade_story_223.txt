<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's seasickness and awkward charm are integrated into his character, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the drive to confront the mirror lacks deeper emotional grounding beyond nostalgia and defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from longing to transformation is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between moon phases and transformation lacks logical depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that complements the nostalgic tone, though sensory details are somewhat sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes longing and resolution, with effective imagery like the ghost orchid bulb, but the central conflict with the mirror feels underexplored, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique setting, some metaphors (e.g., "gilded cage") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of the fortress and transformation, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brief length feels somewhat restrictive.</comment>
