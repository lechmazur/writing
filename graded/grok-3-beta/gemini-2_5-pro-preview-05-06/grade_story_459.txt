<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s ability to see ghosts shapes his introspective personality, and his motivation to find liberation in letting go is clear, but his reactions and actions lack deeper nuance or a distinct voice, feeling somewhat surface-level despite alignment with his traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a subtle arc with a sense of resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between staking out ghost tours and the main action lacks stronger causal impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting enhances the fragile, transient mood effectively, with sensory details like salty air adding immersion, though the timeframe of lunch breaks feels underutilized in deepening atmosphere or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through themes of impermanence and acceptance, with effective imagery like the brittle flower crown, but the central conflict feels understated, and the ending lacks a sharper, memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with ghosts and sandcastles, some metaphors (e.g., “spectral landscape”) feel slightly generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced subtext, missing a truly distinctive style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the flower crown and ghosts, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering depth.</comment>
