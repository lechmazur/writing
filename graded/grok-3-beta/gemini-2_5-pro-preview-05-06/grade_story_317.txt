<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; the crystal growth method is logical but lacks innovation, and cause-effect links are overly predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting of a levitation research facility is intriguing and supports the action, but sensory details are sparseâ€”ozone and fizzing are mentioned but not vividly rendered; atmosphere supports tone minimally.</comment>
