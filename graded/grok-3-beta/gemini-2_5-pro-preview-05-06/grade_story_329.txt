<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the action of finding the hidden passage drives the narrative; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
