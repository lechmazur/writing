<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kai’s role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but their personality and motivations remain surface-level, lacking depth or distinct voice; actions align with the role but reveal little inner conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical flow from discovery to resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between digital despair and physical spaces is coherent but underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall settings are evocative with sensory details like stale air and thrumming energy, enhancing atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and object feels tenuous, and tone could better contrast with concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has a unique premise and some subtext about digital connection, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying, and tension feels understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, and metaphors like “digital miasma” are fresh, but some descriptors are generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuance; the style is distinct but occasionally overelaborate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength; it leaves a lingering idea of digital cleansing, though depth and emotional weight are inconsistent.</comment>
