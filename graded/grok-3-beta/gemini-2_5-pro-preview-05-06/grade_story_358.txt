<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's old-fashioned nature is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to claim a frontier is clear, but reactions to the coffin fragment lack depth in revealing personal stakes or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from aimlessness to revelation is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the cuddling action, while pivotal, lacks grounding in prior buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse setting is vividly contrasted with the playground sounds, enhancing the tone of sanctified dread; sensory details like misted glass are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its theme of interconnectedness; symbolism of the coffin and reflection is strong, but the ending feels more intellectual than emotionally resonant, lacking a deeper gut punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mirror reflections offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "sacred hymn") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the frontier concept; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels somewhat limiting to full impact.</comment>
