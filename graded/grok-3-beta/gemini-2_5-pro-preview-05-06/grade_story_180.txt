<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaric's remorse is clear, shaping his isolation and quest, but his motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in execution; his reactions to objects reveal little beyond surface-level guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but feels incomplete within the word limit; the connection between action and resolution is tenuous, and pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse setting is vivid and complements the tone of guilt, with strong sensory details like bioluminescent fungi; however, the shipwrecks feel underutilized and disconnected from the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Alaric's remorse, but the symbolism (e.g., microscope as wisdom) feels heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of a guilt-ridden mage without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the style feels occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or profound depth.</comment>
