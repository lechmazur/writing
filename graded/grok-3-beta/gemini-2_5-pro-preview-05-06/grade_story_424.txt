<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development of Elara as a mild zealot feels underdeveloped; her devotion lacks depth or specificity, and her motivation to learn about sacrifice is stated rather than shown through nuanced action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from curiosity to revelation, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between visualizing and the concept of sacrifice could be more impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The strange attractor laboratory setting is evocative with rustic refinement, and the timeframe of shifting powers complements the theme, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on sacrifice through personal stories in the banknotes, with strong subtext, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the writing occasionally leans on telling over showing emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of visualizing forgotten wishes offers originality, some imagery feels formulaic, and emotional resonance is diminished by overt statements rather than nuanced reactions; the narrative lacks a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the laboratory and paper money, but the style occasionally overcomplicates simple ideas, and the brief length feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
