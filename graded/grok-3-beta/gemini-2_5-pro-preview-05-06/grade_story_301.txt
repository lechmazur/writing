<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to harness cosmic wonder is clear, but his ethically questionable actions lack deeper exploration of internal conflict or nuance, making his personality feel somewhat one-dimensional despite the intriguing setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's focus on impairing a rival via cryptic codes is conceptually interesting but feels incomplete within the word limit, with an abrupt ending that lacks a satisfying resolution or arc, undermining coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The jazz age time capsule setting is evocative and supports the mood of numb fascination well, with strong sensory details like cigar scent and ghostly saxophone, though the gardening glovesâ€™ connection to the setting feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on ethics and obsession, with decent use of imagery (knitting as cosmic manipulation), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of subtext or deeper conflict resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
