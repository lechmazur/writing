<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's irate nature is evident and shapes his actions, but his internal conflict and motivation to heal old wounds feel somewhat underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper nuance in his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a beginning, middle, and tentative resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between generational dialogues and the action of pacifying is not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting of the witch's spellbook study and the childhood bedroom effectively enhances the mood of decay and nostalgia, with strong sensory details, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly ambiguous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through shared pain and has promising subtext, but the ending feels more tentative than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharper definition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some individual style, metaphors like "shattered glass" feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than fully shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
