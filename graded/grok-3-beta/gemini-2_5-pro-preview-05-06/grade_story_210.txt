<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Alistair Finch's amiability is stated but not deeply shown through interactions or nuanced behavior; his motivation to fuse lore with modern dreams feels somewhat abstract and lacks specific personal stakes or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the concept of navigating shadows drives the narrative, though cause-effect links between vibrations and revelations are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is evocative and enhances the tone of mystery; sensory details like vibrations and whispers are effective, though more varied sensory immersion (smell, touch) could deepen the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on history and mystery, with decent imagery, but lacks a strong emotional impact or subtext; the ending is purposeful but not particularly memorable or layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat predictable ghost story tropes without subversion; metaphors like "language older than stone" feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the lighthouse's history, but the style occasionally leans toward over-description, hindering clarity; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
