<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jed's spirited nature and lumberjack background are somewhat reflected in his awkward grace, but his motivation to learn healing traditions feels underdeveloped and shifts too abruptly to dread without sufficient internal conflict or nuance in his voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from curiosity to dread is present, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; the coded letter drives the story, yet cause-effect links between nightmares and realization are vague, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is evocative and complements the tone of harsh tenderness; sensory details like "bone-white walls" enhance mood, though some connections between setting and character motivation remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and prompts thought about time and destiny, but over-relies on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks emotional punch, and subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a future war letter is intriguing, avoiding complete predictability, but some descriptors feel generic, and emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext; style shows individuality but occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a lingering question about fate, yet clarity is occasionally hindered by rushed transitions and underdeveloped depth.</comment>
