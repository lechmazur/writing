<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's insomnia and poetic nature are reflected in his restless, reflective personality, but his motivation to discover non-violence feels slightly underdeveloped and lacks a deeper personal stakes-driven root beyond the whispers' guidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from destructive confessions to cultivating peace is clear but feels rushed within the word limit, with the action of "eliminate" driving the story logically but lacking a stronger climactic moment to solidify the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting enhances the eerie, introspective tone effectively, with sensory details like dust and decay supporting the mood, though the subway timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the core atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional shift toward peace, with subtle symbolism in the botanical samples, but the impact is diminished by a lack of visceral conflict or tension, and the ending feels more contemplative than deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in linking whispers to non-violence, the emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the narrative style lacks a truly distinctive voice or fresh metaphorical depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style occasionally leans toward over-explanation, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, leaving the depth somewhat surface-level.</comment>
