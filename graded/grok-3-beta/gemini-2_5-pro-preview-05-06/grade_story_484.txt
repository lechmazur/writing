<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Barnaby’s motivation to embody his values is clear, but his groggy brewer persona feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions beyond surface-level musings. His voice is distinct yet inconsistent in impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the connection between protest, graveyard, and personal resolve feels tenuous. Pacing is uneven, with too much introspection slowing the narrative, and the action of initiating feels vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting is evocative and fits the tone of encroaching darkness, with some sensory detail, but its connection to the protest lull and character motivation feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has moments of emotional resonance and uses imagery (broken mirror, darkness) effectively, but the central conflict is weak, and the ending lacks punch. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; subtext is present but shallow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of haunted settings and personal resolve without fresh subversion. Metaphors are occasionally generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic. The brief length feels limiting, not deliberate, and while there’s a lingering thought, it lacks the depth for true impact.</comment>
