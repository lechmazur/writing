<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s earthy farmer persona is evident in his connection to the soil, but his motivation to restore sound-scrolls feels slightly disconnected from his rustic identity; more depth in how his background influences this mission would strengthen the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the action of celebration and the concept of breaking chains is logical yet lacks deeper exploration.</comment>
