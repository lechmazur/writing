<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's weariness and motivation for freedom are clear and consistent, shaping his internal journey, but his distinct voice is underdeveloped, and reactions to the playing card lack deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit with a logical progression from encounter to introspection, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the jostle action's impact on the narrative is underwhelming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lava lamp meditation room enhances the tone of quiet introspection and supports the concept of breaking free, though sensory details are limited and the community garden setting feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Alistair's shift in perspective, with some effective symbolism in the lamps, but the ending lacks a strong punch, and subtext is only moderately developed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing some creative integration, but the style lacks distinct flair, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
