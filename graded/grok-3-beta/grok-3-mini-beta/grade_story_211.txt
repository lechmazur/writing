<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the spin-the-bottle confessions as a method feel forced and disrupt coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned schoolhouse in a ghost town is evocatively described with sensory details, enhancing the tone of cheerful despair, but the connection between setting and botanical diary feels tenuous.</comment>
