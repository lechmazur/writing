<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's naivety and gambling nature are present but underdeveloped; his motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the candle mold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between docking, lectures, and the storm surge are tenuous, disrupting coherence and logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative with strong sensory details like salt-kissed air, enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of candlelit dinners feels underexplored and disconnected from the broader mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through laughing tears, with decent symbolism in the candle, but the ending lacks punch; subtext is present but not fully layered, and conflict resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes about the sea and gambling without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and style lacks distinct individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
