<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to witness pure grace is clear, but the impassive deputy's emotional transformation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in reaction to the twist tie or bees' language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the connection between oil changes and the climactic moment of grace is tenuous, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting of the lush orchard in a cathedral is evocative with strong sensory detail, but the timeframe of oil changes feels disconnected and underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (bees, grace) evoke thought, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some originality exists in combining elements, the language often veers into purple prose, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative element integration, but overly ornate style hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
