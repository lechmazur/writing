<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to confront phobias is clear, but Alex's personality lacks depth beyond fear; reactions feel predictable and lack a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed in the pyramid descent; connections between garage sales and the library are tenuous and lack logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere in the pyramid is evocative with whispers and shadows, but garage sale settings lack sensory detail; tone supports the concept but isn't fully immersive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on predictable phobia-confrontation trope without subversion; metaphors like "dance with madness" feel overused; lacks nuanced emotion and unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion, but feels constructed around them rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or clarity in style to elevate it.</comment>
