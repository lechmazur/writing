<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as a burnt-out general is clear, but his motivation to dethrone fear feels abstract and underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes or specificity in his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven; the resolution is rushed, and the connection between shared anxieties and plot progression lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Dark Matter Diner setting is evocative with strong sensory details like engine grease and seaweed, enhancing the atmosphere of cosmic desolation, though the timeframe "between rides" feels underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of rational absurdity offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of communal healing; metaphors like "fear's throne" are generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like photographs, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
