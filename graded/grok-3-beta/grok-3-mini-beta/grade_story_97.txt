<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's fact-minded nature is clear, but her shift to empathy feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or gradual progression, weakening the authenticity of her motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the emotional turning point, and the connection between heartbreak visions and plot resolution is not fully logical or earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly described and complements the tone of optimistic desperation, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elara's transformation and uses imagery effectively, but the theme of empathy over logic feels heavy-handed, and the ending lacks a lingering, nuanced impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of an oracle learning empathy is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar tropes of emotional awakening without fresh subversion, and some metaphors feel generic rather than striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength, limiting depth.</comment>
