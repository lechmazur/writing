<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear, but her personality as an eager lookout feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions beyond the surface drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between poltergeist activity and the wager of faith is somewhat forced, lacking deeper causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Roman villa with holographic displays is intriguing and complements the digital age theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional stakes of Elara's quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara's yearning for connection, and the sewing box as a symbolic bridge is a nice touch, but the writing often tells rather than shows, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the blend of ancient and modern elements shows some originality, the narrative relies on familiar ghost story tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions lack nuance, feeling somewhat generic and stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic to the narrative; the style is clear but lacks depth or a lingering impact beyond the surface plot.</comment>
