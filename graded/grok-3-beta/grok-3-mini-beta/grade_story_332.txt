<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of resuscitating creativity driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are not always sharply defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered with a strong atmosphere of isolation that complements the tone of intimate separation; sensory details are present but could be more varied and specific.</comment>
