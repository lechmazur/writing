<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the puzzle piece driving discovery, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and some transitions are abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hydroponic noodle farm is vividly described with sensory details like swirling confetti, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting's connection to the mystery feels forced at times.</comment>
