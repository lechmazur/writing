<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the betrayal and resolution, driven by the lunge, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments; coherence is maintained, though the connection between beginning and end is somewhat forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and centuries-long timeframe create a compelling backdrop, enhanced by sensory details like the chimesâ€™ hum; atmosphere supports the tone of savage grace, though some setting-object connections feel superficial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the style supports its ethereal tone; however, the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth, though it leaves a lingering sense of cosmic duty.</comment>
