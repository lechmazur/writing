<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for self-acceptance is clear, but her "privately open" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond surface-level introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between reverse-engineering the nest and personal growth feels forced, with pacing rushed at critical emotional turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly imagined and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the bird’s nest feels tenuous rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Elara’s journey, with decent use of symbolism (nest as aspiration), but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of self-acceptance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the setting is unique, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of personal redemption without subversion, and metaphors like "broken promises" feel generic, lacking fresh insight or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often overreaches with ornate language, obscuring clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
