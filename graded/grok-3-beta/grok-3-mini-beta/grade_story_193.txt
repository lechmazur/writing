<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for curing loneliness is clear, but the exiled prince's personality lacks depth beyond generic melancholy; reactions to the mortar and pestle feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the action of improving loneliness drives the story, though connections between events lack nuanced cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the abandoned customs office and snowstorm effectively enhances the tone of isolation; sensory details like frost-laden halls are evocative, though some descriptions remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with themes of connection, but symbolism (e.g., key, mortar) feels heavy-handed; ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "ghosts of borders" feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly with herbalistâ€™s introduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally leans on ornate language over clarity; brief length feels somewhat limiting, lacking deeper exploration of themes.</comment>
