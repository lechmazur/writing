<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Alex's jaded nature and strange attribute are present but lack depth in motivation beyond a vague quest to understand the past. Actions align with traits, but the voice feels generic, missing distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure struggles with coherence; the action of globalizing via doodles feels forced and lacks logical grounding. Pacing is rushed, and the arc feels incomplete despite the word limit, with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory setting is evocative and ties well to the timeframe of impending fireworks, enhancing atmosphere. However, sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is moderate; imagery and symbolism (crystals, scalpel) are present but overexplained, reducing subtext. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the ending lacks a strong punch despite thematic potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly ornate language and generic metaphors (e.g., "over-shaken cocktail"). Emotional handling feels surface-level, and the narrative follows a predictable redemption arc without fresh twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels fragmented despite creative elements. Assigned elements are incorporated but often awkwardly, and the style leans toward purple prose, hindering clarity. It lacks a lingering impact or depth.</comment>
