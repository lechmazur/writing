<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to restore a lost art form is clear, but the traveler's rebellious nature feels surface-level, lacking depth in personal stakes until the late reveal of lost love, which is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between the organ's resonance and manifesting visions is intriguing yet underexplained, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is evocative and ties well to the labyrinth concept, with sensory details like dusty corridors enhancing atmosphere, but the timeframe of revolution feels tacked on and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some reflection on life and memory through obituaries, with decent use of symbolism via the mask, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of obituaries for the living is unique, the writing leans on overused metaphors like "feverish flame" and lacks nuanced emotional depth, feeling somewhat formulaic in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often overcomplicates clarity with ornate language; it leaves a lingering idea of preserving memory, yet feels constrained by length rather than deliberate.</comment>
