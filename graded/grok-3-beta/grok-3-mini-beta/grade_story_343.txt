<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Finnick's melancholy is well-portrayed, but his motivation to restore sacred practices feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; his voice is distinct but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of commanding feels abrupt, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are weak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection to paint drying as a timeframe feels forced and underutilized; tone supports the concept unevenly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with some symbolism (tea leaves, drawing), but the ending lacks impact; subtext is present but shallow, and conflict resolution feels too neat for the tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, metaphors like "forgotten stars" feel generic; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative leans on predictable unity tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
