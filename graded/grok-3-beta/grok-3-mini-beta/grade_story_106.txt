<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's sullen nature and objective bias are present but underdeveloped; motivation to escape a dead end is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of erasing boundaries via zest feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect in system overrides.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underwater power station is vividly described with bioluminescent algae, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse beyond sight; setting supports motivation unevenly, lacking deeper integration with tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some emotional resonance and symbolism with the quilt and stamps, but subtext is shallow; ending is purposeful yet predictable; conflict resolution feels abrupt, and showing vs. telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of erasing boundaries offers some originality, metaphors like "borrowed mask" feel generic; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; lingering impact is minimal due to surface-level depth.</comment>
