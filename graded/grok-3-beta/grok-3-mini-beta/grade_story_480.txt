<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Alex's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth; the "indifferent enthusiasm" is stated but not convincingly shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the receipt and the ritual feels forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed supernatural elements at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully amplify the character's curiosity or the ritual's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with the cost of connections, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; the ending feels unresolved without a satisfying punch, and literary devices are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the concept of a social media exorcist is original, the execution relies on predictable supernatural tropes, and emotional resonance is stated rather than felt; metaphors like "quietly loud" feel repetitive and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from forced connections; it lacks a lingering depth or clarity that would elevate it beyond a surface-level narrative.</comment>
