<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's drive to combat stagnation, but the "calm doomsayer" trait feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance; his voice, while distinct, borders on melodramatic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with the resumption of Elias's crusade rushed; cause and effect are logical, but pacing suffers from abrupt shifts, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and sunrise timeframe are vividly described and enhance the mood, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting's connection to the skateboard feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through loss of innocence, but overreliance on telling rather than showing, coupled with an unsatisfying ending, diminishes impact; symbolism is present but heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution leans on predictable tropes of a tormented prophet; metaphors like "placid ferocity" are intriguing but overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative; style is clear but lacks polish, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
