<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elowen’s wistful nature and arrogance are present but underdeveloped; motivation to reclaim the wild feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with kindling as a central action, but pacing feels uneven, and the resolution lacks depth or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the contrast with nature’s ghost, though the atmosphere occasionally overpowers character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (dust motes as growth codes) are intriguing but not fully realized; emotional impact is present but diluted by overt telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution leans on cyberpunk tropes without subversion, and some descriptors (e.g., “obviously subtle”) feel repetitive and forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a mild lingering thought, though not profound enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
