<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's bookish nature and assassin background are intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to establish a new order feels clear but lacks depth in execution, with reactions to the key cover feeling somewhat forced rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of soothing nightmares driving the story, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between the key cover and broadcasting secrets is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frequency monitoring station setting is evocative and complements the tone of mournful elation; sensory details like "dim hum" enhance atmosphere, though the connection between setting and object feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through mournful elation and uses symbolism effectively with the key cover, but the ending feels more abrupt than satisfying, and subtext, while present, lacks sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of secret keepers and frequencies is original, some metaphors like "breath of forgotten gods" feel overwrought; emotional handling shows nuance in places but often states feelings directly, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling of loss, though not profoundly so.</comment>
