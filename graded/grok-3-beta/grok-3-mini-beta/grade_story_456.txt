<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's morbid florist persona and motivation to understand cosmic cycles are intriguing, but her "neutrally passionate" and "boldly timid" traits feel inconsistently applied, lacking depth in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of obliging a dying wish feels underdeveloped, and pacing is uneven with rushed introspection at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is evocative and complements the cosmic theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elara's motivation or the story's mood beyond surface-level imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story offers some emotional resonance and symbolism with the candle and cosmic cycles, but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist in a floating dojo is unique, the execution relies on overused metaphors (petals as stars) and lacks nuanced emotion, with some prose feeling ornate and forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overwrought language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking lasting impact.</comment>
