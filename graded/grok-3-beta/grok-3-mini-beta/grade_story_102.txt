<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Thorne's spinelessness is central but feels repetitive and overstated, lacking depth in how it shapes nuanced actions or growth; motivation to hush the prophecy is clear but not deeply explored beyond fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the prophecy's unraveling lacks sufficient buildup or consequence for coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of doubt, but sensory details are uneven, and the timeframe "hush after the wind" feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some imagery (luminous doubt) is striking, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; ending feels purposeful but lacks a deeper, lingering resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing leans on repetitive phrases like "luminous doubt" and generic descriptors; lacks fresh metaphors and shows predictable patterns in character doubt and resolution, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but style often overcomplicates clarity; brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth and lasting impact.</comment>
