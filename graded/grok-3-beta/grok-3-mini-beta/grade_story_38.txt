<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia and poetic nature are present but underdeveloped; motivation for non-violence feels forced and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but rushed; the action of eliminating resentment is logical but lacks impactful progression or resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway stops create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of empty abundance only partially aligns with the setting's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (botanical samples as rebirth) are effective, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While there are unique elements, the story leans on predictable tropes of haunted spaces and tormented artists without fresh subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brevity limits depth; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound impact.</comment>
