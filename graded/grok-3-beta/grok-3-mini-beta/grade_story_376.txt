<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable rogue tropes without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, and style occasionally veers into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
