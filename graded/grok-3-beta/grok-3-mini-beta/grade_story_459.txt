<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's ability to see ghosts and her elegantly clumsy nature are intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation for liberation feels stated rather than deeply felt, lacking nuanced emotional depth in her reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of dissecting the crown feels forced as a resolution; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a unique setting that enhances the theme of impermanence, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere's connection to Elara's ghostly visions feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of letting go, with some effective symbolism in the crown, but the writing often tells rather than shows, and the ending lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution relies on predictable ghostly tropes without subversion; metaphors like "gentle wave" are generic, and emotional resonance feels surface-level rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style leans toward overwrought descriptions, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative spark beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
