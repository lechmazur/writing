<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's flighty nature is inconsistently portrayed, with erratic actions not fully aligning with her deeper motivation to leave a legacy; her serene anger feels forced rather than organic to her personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of linearizing driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links between paintings and legacy are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret society initiation hall setting is evocative and supports the tone of serene anger, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and the grease-stained patch feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has moments of subtext with the flicker of unity, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of Elara's anger and legacy desire; the ending feels bittersweet yet lacks depth for true resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of unity and hidden details offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable secret society tropes, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, often stating feelings rather than showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of legacy, yet feels constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
