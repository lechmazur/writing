<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to mapping railways as a tribute is clear, but the woodsman’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond grief; the "artfully messy" attribute is mentioned but lacks depth in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced at times; the action of measuring echoes drives the story, but pacing is uneven, with emotional resolution rushed within the word limit, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Radio wave garden setting is evocative with strong sensory imagery, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the character’s motivation and the timeframe feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through grief and honesty, with decent use of symbolism (hairbrush, echoes), but lacks deeper subtext; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying due to rushed emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While imagery is creative, metaphors like "veins of a dying world" feel overused; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and tone shifts unnaturally at times, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is ornate and occasionally hinders clarity; lacks a lingering impact beyond surface narrative.</comment>
