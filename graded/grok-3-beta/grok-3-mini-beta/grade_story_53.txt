<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's rash protector trait is evident in her past actions, but her shift to cosmic guardianship feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation; her unique ability is mentioned but not fully integrated into her personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between moving day and the cosmic discovery feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with the introspective shift overshadowing action and coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and howling caverns create a vivid atmosphere with strong sensory details, but the mystical tone occasionally overpowers the narrative, and the setting's connection to the postcards feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional resonance through cosmic solace, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery is present but often generic, and the ending lacks a strong, memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic postcards is intriguing, the execution leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; language is ornate at times, bordering on purple prose, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
