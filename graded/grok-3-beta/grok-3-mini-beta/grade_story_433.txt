<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's hardheaded nature and broken spirit are evident, but her motivation feels somewhat generic and lacks depth in execution; her reactions to the prophecy scraps reveal little new about her beyond surface-level regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the struggle through prophecy scraps feels forced as a driver; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution at the end disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery and snow days create a striking atmosphere, with sensory details like melting sculptures enhancing mood, but the setting's connection to Elara's motivation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While imagery and symbolism (snow as healing) are present, the emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; the ending lacks a satisfying punch, and the theme of power's cost feels heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story leans on predictable tropes of redemption through nature without subversion; metaphors like "snow's embrace" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by forced integration of elements like the gallery; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and while thereâ€™s a lingering thought of surrender, the depth feels superficial for a top-tier publication.</comment>
