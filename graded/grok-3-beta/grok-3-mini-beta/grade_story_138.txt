<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Everett's struggle against past illusions, but his personality lacks depth beyond hollow recklessness; reactions to the drone and ticket stubs feel symbolic yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced within the word limit; pacing is uneven with rushed confessions, and coherence suffers from abrupt shifts between introspection and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the combustion lab enhances the tone of danger and recklessness effectively; sensory details like chemical scents are evocative, though underutilized for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through Everett's transformation, but symbolism (ticket stubs, drone) feels heavy-handed; ending is purposeful yet lacks lasting impact or nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on predictable tropes of noble downfall; metaphors are occasionally fresh, though emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and depth beyond the narrative is minimal.</comment>
