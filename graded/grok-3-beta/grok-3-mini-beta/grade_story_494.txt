<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's arrogance and doubtfully confident nature are well-integrated into his actions and motivations, but his internal conflict feels somewhat repetitive and lacks deeper nuance in expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of authorizing driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard and the timeframe 'between breaths' are evocatively described with sensory details like jasmine and bamboo rustling, enhancing the mood, though the connection to the object feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Kael's harsh tenderness and uses symbolism effectively with the tapestry, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the theme of unshackled potential feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (e.g., "spark in the darkness") feel overused, and the emotional depth, though present, occasionally relies on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style sometimes veers into overly ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
