<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details like creaking metal and flickering lights, enhancing atmosphere, but the link between setting and spiritual concept feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through chaos and beauty, with some evocative imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying resolution.</comment>
