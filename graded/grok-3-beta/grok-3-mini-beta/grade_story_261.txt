<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The orchard keeper's immortality and motivation to restore the ecosystem are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond bitter laughter and vague pain; reactions to the earbud cover feel symbolic but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the launch driving action, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between sketching and ecosystem renewal lacks logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is vividly imagined and complements the tone of decay and renewal, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the earbud cover feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (ink patterns, quantum fruits) are striking, but emotional impact is muted by repetitive focus on bitterness; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a deeper resonance or subtext beyond surface themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is unique, the writing leans on ornate language and repetitive phrases like "bitter laughter," risking purple prose; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from overemphasis on symbolism over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though style occasionally hinders impact.</comment>
