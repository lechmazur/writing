<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elowen’s loneliness and motivation to read the cosmos are stated but not deeply explored through actions or nuanced dialogue, lacking a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between bickering and cosmic revelation is underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
