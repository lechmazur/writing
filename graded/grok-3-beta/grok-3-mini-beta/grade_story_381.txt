<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems is clear, but the necromancer's personality feels underdeveloped beyond generic resolve; the connection to the baseball cap is symbolic but lacks depth in revealing personal history or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, conflict, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and the integration of shared movie love as a method feels forced, disrupting narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone, but the atmosphere inconsistently supports character motivation, feeling more decorative than integral at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance through shared nostalgia, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; dialogue feels stilted and overly referential, lacking natural flow; central conflict is present but resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in blending futuristic and nostalgic elements, but leans on predictable tropes of shadowy entities and heroic resolve; metaphors like "sound of resolve" are repetitive and generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering depth or question to ponder post-reading.</comment>
