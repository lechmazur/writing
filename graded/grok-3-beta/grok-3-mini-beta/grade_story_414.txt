<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the barricading action feels forced as a resolution, and pacing suffers from overly dense exposition, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly described and enhances the ethereal mood, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels more decorative than integral.</comment>
