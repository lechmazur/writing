<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's aloofness and halfhearted commitment are portrayed with some depth, but his transformation feels abrupt and lacks nuanced progression; motivation is clear but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of humanizing the library feels underdeveloped in its execution; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The memory crystal library is evocative and supports the tone of gloomy cheerfulness, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the wooden spoon feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet mood and uses symbolism (spoon, lullabies) effectively, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic metaphors (crystals as memories) and lacks fresh emotional nuance; tone is consistent but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks depth for a truly memorable impact.</comment>
