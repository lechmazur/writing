<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times; the connection between crystals' growth and reactor stabilization is logical but underexplained, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The levitation research facility and breaking dawn setting are evocative and complement the tone, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion; atmosphere supports the concept but lacks vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has a central conflict and some emotional resonance, but relies heavily on telling over showing; imagery and symbolism are present but not striking or memorable, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "web of trust" feel generic; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, often stating feelings directly, and tone shifts slightly, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
