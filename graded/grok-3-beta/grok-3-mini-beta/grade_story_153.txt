<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to master her reality is clear, but her personality as an eternal college student feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the headlamp and digitization process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the digitization via swapped journals feels forced and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The underground city and post-star timeframe are vividly described with bioluminescent fungi and isolation, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the headlamp's connection to setting feels symbolic yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through immortality's burdens, with some effective symbolism (headlamp as knowledge), but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of digitizing memories is intriguing, the story leans on generic descriptors and predictable immortality tropes without subversion; metaphors like the collapsed mine feel overused, lacking fresh nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style often obscures clarity with ornate language; it lacks a lingering impact, feeling more like a constrained exercise than a deliberate short piece.</comment>
