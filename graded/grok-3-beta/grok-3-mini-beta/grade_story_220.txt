<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's aloofness and odd habits are distinct but underdeveloped; motivation to pierce illusions feels abstract and lacks grounding in specific, relatable desires, weakening emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the chance meeting driving change, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; some transitions are abrupt, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The port city labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the mood of isolation and discovery; however, the 'wounded season' timeframe feels underexplored and slightly disconnected from the action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable transformation tropes without subversion; emotional depth is stated rather than shown, and style occasionally veers into overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but not striking, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
