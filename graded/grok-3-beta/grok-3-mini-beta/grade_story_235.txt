<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eiko's attribute of being "dramatically subtle" is reflected in her actions, but her motivation to provoke an unspoken conversation feels vague and lacks depth in execution; her personality doesn't fully influence her methods, leaving her character somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, and the action of repositioning drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect relationships between meteors and fate are not entirely logical or clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Japanese castle and art class timeframe work well together, with evocative sensory details enhancing the atmosphere; however, the tone of distant intimacy occasionally feels forced rather than organic to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through its theme of connection, with effective imagery and symbolism, but the lack of dialogue limits character depth, and the central conflict feels understated, reducing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors (e.g., "ephemeral meteor showers across paper skies") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
