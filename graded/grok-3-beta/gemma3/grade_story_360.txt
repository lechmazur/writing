<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's meekness and sincerity are well-integrated into his personality and motivation, shaping a unique necromancer who seeks wonder over power; however, his voice lacks distinctiveness, and reactions to the pen feel slightly underwhelming for deeper revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of regaining perspective driving a coherent narrative; yet, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between the sprite's theft and the dewdrop method are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gloomhaven's humid, fungi-lit setting enhances the dewdrop method and mystic tone effectively, with sensory details like goblin laughter adding immersion; however, the connection between the pen and setting feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on endless exploration through strong symbolism of the tangled tapestry and broken pen, with a satisfying ending; yet, it leans on telling over showing for emotional depth, and the central conflict feels understated for the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining a meek necromancer with mystic simplicity, avoiding overt clich√©s; however, some metaphors like "tangled tapestry" feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than deeply shown, risking generic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the dewdrop method, leaving a lingering sense of wonder; yet, the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate in fully exploring depth.</comment>
