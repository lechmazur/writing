<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Tiber and Elara are intriguing, with Tiber’s stoic nature and motivation to archive rituals showing depth, but their personalities lack distinct voices and nuanced reactions, feeling somewhat archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between Tiber’s action and the story’s end is more implied than impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch’s training ground is evocatively described with sensory details like gnarled hawthorn, enhancing the mood, though the atmosphere’s connection to the characters’ motivations feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through its theme of memory and loss, with some effective symbolism in the floorboard, but the dialogue is sparse and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on preserving dark magic, it leans on familiar tropes of mysterious wanderers and reluctant witches without fully subverting them; metaphors are decent but not strikingly fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the floorboard, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
