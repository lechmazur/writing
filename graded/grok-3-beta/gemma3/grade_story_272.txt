<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's social awkwardness and cynicism are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to sever past regrets feels intriguing yet lacks depth in execution due to limited insight into his emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot's use of "reaping" memories via reversed trails is conceptually interesting, but the arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with pacing rushed at critical emotional turns, leaving resolution vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The diner and archive setting effectively contrasts modern decay with forgotten arts, enhanced by sensory details like ozone and fluorescent hum, though the atmosphere could deeper reflect Tiberâ€™s inner turmoil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through regret imagery, but subtext is shallow; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks punch, and "showing" is inconsistent, with some telling of emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting memories is original, with fresh metaphors like the "tree of regret," but emotional handling feels slightly formulaic, and sensory details occasionally lean generic rather than vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering idea of renewal, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
