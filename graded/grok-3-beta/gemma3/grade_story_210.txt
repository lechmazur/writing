<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's amiability is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to fuse lore with dreams is clear but lacks depth in execution, feeling more stated than shown through nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments; the concept of navigating shadows drives the story, though cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly rendered with sensory details like creaking timbers, enhancing atmosphere and supporting the tone of mystery; however, the waiting room setting feels disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with symbolic use of the crossword and lighthouse, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level character reactions; subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of navigating shadows offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like "Serpentâ€™s Eye" feel generic, lacking fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
