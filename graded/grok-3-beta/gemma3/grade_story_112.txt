<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and consistent, but Tiber's "factually imaginative" attribute feels underexplored in shaping his actions beyond a passing mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the hopscotch method, while creative, isn't fully integrated into a logical cause-effect flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the Writing System Archive enhances the theme of preservation, and sensory details like the stew's aroma are evocative, though the timeframe of the melting snowflake feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a poignant emotional response with themes of loss and resilience, but subtext is somewhat surface-level; the ending is satisfying yet lacks a deeper lingering conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original concept of recipes in games is intriguing, but some metaphors (e.g., "relentless tide of forgetting") feel slightly clich√©d; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of purpose, but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; style supports clarity yet isn't distinctive enough.</comment>
