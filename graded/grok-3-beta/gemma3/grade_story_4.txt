<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map sacred spaces is clear, but the DJ persona feels underdeveloped beyond the concept of channeling gods; lacks a distinct personal voice or deeper emotional nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the unraveling thread as a method feels forced and disrupts logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the alchemical orchard greenhouse is evocative and enhances the mystical tone with strong sensory details like "borrowed starlight," though the endless night feels slightly underutilized in relation to character actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining DJ and ancient gods, with fresh metaphors like "borrowed starlight," but some descriptors are generic, and the thread motif feels contrived rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
