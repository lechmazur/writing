<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by Elias’s quest to manifest emotion; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some causal links between choices and outcomes are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Giant’s Bookshelf is vividly realized with sensory details like the “low thrum” and “ivory ghosts,” enhancing the atmosphere of mystery and urgency; the setting strongly supports the tone, though the timeframe of revolution feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the mask’s shifting expressions and the music’s power, with strong imagery and a satisfying ending; however, the central theme of emotional revolution lacks deeper subtext, and some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of Visage-Weaving and the mask’s emotional resonance are original, but the narrative occasionally leans on familiar tropes of hidden knowledge and rebellion without fully subverting them; metaphors are fresh, though some descriptions border on ornate.</comment>
