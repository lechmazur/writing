<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in the concept of decoding fate via doodles, but metaphors like "restless beast" feel generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering idea of fate, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
