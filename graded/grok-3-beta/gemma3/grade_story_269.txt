<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for ascension is clear but lacks depth; Tiber's nostalgia as a tailor feels underexplored in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous despite the concept of parallel lives driving the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Steampunk setting and storm atmosphere are evocative with sensory details like rain on brass, but the menacing tone feels underdeveloped and disconnected from character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with parallel lives, but dialogue feels stilted; ending lacks punch, and subtext about ascension is intriguing yet not fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Concept of parallel lives offers some originality, but execution relies on predictable tropes of alternate selves; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice; lacks lingering depth or a truly memorable impact.</comment>
