<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation to map migration routes is clear, but his background as a conscientious objector feels underexplored and disconnected from his actions; his personality lacks depth beyond "valiantly bored," which doesn't fully shape his behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Tiber's investigation driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; connections between craft fairs and migration routes are logical yet underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in a storm-battered ravine is vividly described and enhances the eerie atmosphere, complementing the tone of coy malevolence; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about the Newcomers, with some subtext around unseen currents, but lacks strong emotional impact; imagery is effective yet not striking, and the ending feels more intriguing than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining migration mapping with craft fairs, but some descriptors feel generic, and the tone wavers slightly; metaphors are fresh in places but not consistently memorable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the rusty nail, but the brief length limits depth; it leaves a lingering question about the Newcomers, though style occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over clarity.</comment>
