<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the rallying action drives the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress setting is evocative and ties well to the art fairs and sand calligraphy, enhancing the atmosphere of suppressed creativity, though sensory details are sparse and could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of cultural liberation, with some effective symbolism in the rosary, but the conflict resolution feels too neat, and the writing lacks a distinctive style to elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of sand calligraphy offers originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of rebellion against oppression without significant subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
