<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's reticence is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to dethrone complacency feels surface-level and lacks emotional depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and end, but the knocking action feels slightly contrived; pacing is managed well within the word limit, though coherence dips with abrupt supernatural shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and cake baking feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with echoes as visions, but lacks deep emotional resonance or subtext; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution feels rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of echoes is original, but the execution relies on some predictable supernatural tropes; writing style is clear, though sensory details occasionally feel generic rather than uniquely evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
