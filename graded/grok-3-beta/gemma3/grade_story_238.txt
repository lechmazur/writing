<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's gloomy nature and abrasive charm are evident, but his motivation to reclaim his stolen light feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking depth in how it drives his actions beyond passive listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Tiber collecting confessions as fragments of light, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between overheard stories and confronting Midnight remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ticket booth setting is vividly described with sensory details like the smell of cotton candy and regret, enhancing the melancholic atmosphere and complementing Tiber’s motivation, though the timeframe’s impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of loss and longing through Tiber’s quest, with some effective imagery (e.g., “skeletal remains”), but the ending lacks a strong emotional punch, and the central conflict with Midnight feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of transient realities offers originality, the execution relies on somewhat predictable melancholic tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance is stated more than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the drone and payphone confessions, but the style occasionally leans toward over-description, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
