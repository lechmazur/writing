<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Tiber’s profession as a cuddler reflecting his need for connection, but his prejudice against Skyfarers feels somewhat forced and lacks deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the farmer’s market encounter and the gala return is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is evocatively described and ties to the theme of decay, but sensory details are sparse, and the farmer’s market setting feels disconnected from the overall atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Tiber’s shift in perspective, with effective symbolism in the ticket punch, but the dialogue feels slightly contrived, and the theme of empathy is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with the professional cuddler and spaceport, some metaphors (e.g., “forgotten constellations”) feel overused, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the ticket punch, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped emotional depth.</comment>
