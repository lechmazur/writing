<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Tiber’s unease and Thorne’s obsession providing some depth, but motivations feel slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; their voices lack distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between beginning and end is present but not strongly impactful within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital setting is vividly realized and enhances the story’s mood of isolation, though sensory details are sparse; the atmosphere supports the theme of fragility well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response with subtext about redemption, but the ending feels slightly predictable; literary devices like symbolism are present but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is moderate; while the setting and concept are intriguing, emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and some metaphors feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it lacks the depth and polish for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
