<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation to witness unspoken truths is clear and consistent, but his personality as a "mechanic of souls" lacks depth beyond the conceptual; his reactions and actions are intriguing but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with gathering fragments as a central action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; coherence is maintained, though the connection between beginning and end could be stronger within the tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and star-river create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the tone of exultant grief; sensory details are evocative, though some elements feel slightly disconnected from the character's immediate actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response and uses strong imagery, but the central conflict is understated; the theme of unspoken regret is clear, though subtext could be more layered for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., "rusted metal and polished chrome") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at a lack of nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as powerfully as top-tier work demands.</comment>
