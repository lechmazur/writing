<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to create a legacy of compassion is clear, but her "aimlessly passionate" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently tied to her deliberate actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of attaining knowledge driving the narrative, though the leaf pattern method feels slightly contrived and pacing is uneven at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The subterranean colosseum under an amusement park is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and the paper airplane timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of compassion, and symbolism (paper airplane, fork) adds depth, but the ending lacks a stronger punch and subtext is somewhat surface-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
