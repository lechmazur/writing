<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tiber's motivation to understand the language of flowers is intriguing but underdeveloped; his "spineless" nature feels more implied than shown through actions or internal conflict, lacking depth in personality and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with influence driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax with Lyra's shift, and cause-effect links between tears and control are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly rendered with sensory details like rain-slicked panes, enhancing the doleful cheer tone and supporting Tiber's motivation; however, the timeframe of rain showers feels underutilized in impacting the mood further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic curiosity and uses floral symbolism effectively, with subtext about control and memory; yet, the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth, and the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of floral language and tear-based influence is original, some metaphors (e.g., "petal turned in conversation") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the greenhouse and tears, leaving a lingering melancholic thought; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
