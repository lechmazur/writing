<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's portrayal as a calm doomsayer is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to resist the Council feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding or backstory to make his defiance truly compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the resume submission and the broader conflict with the Council feels forced and lacks sufficient buildup or resolution to feel coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The steampunk workshop and barn loft setting create a vivid atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like dust motes and golden light, but the connection between the setting and the skateboard or broader conflict feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Tiber's quiet defiance, with some effective imagery, but the central conflict lacks depth, and the ending feels more declarative than satisfying or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of resisting conformity is unique in context, the execution relies on predictable tropes of rebellion against authority, and the language occasionally veers into generic descriptors rather than fresh, nuanced detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style lacks the polish or depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a faint impression rather than a lingering, profound thought or feeling.</comment>
