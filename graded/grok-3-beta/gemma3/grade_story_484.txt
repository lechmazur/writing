<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation to embody quiet decency is clear, but his personality as a groggy brewer feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice; his actions align with his values but reveal little depth beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between the encroaching darkness and the action of initiating change is logical, though not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting and the oppressive atmosphere effectively enhance the tone of encroaching darkness; sensory details like the cold air and discoloration are evocative, though the protest lull feels underexplored in the setting's context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of decency against darkness, with some effective symbolism in the mirror shard; however, the ending feels more hopeful than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks deeper tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on predictable haunted mansion tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like the darkness as lost values are interesting but not entirely fresh, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, the style lacks the polish for top-tier clarity, and the lingering impact is modest, lacking profound depth or resonance.</comment>
