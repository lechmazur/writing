<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map tunnels and remember is clear, but Tiber's "blameless smuggler" trait feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping his actions or personality beyond a label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, driven by the act of overreaching, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links in the chamber discovery are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like the garden scent and whispering gallery, enhancing mood, but the setting's connection to the timeframe of the final countdown feels vague and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on memory and survival with strong symbolism in the necklace and map, but the ending lacks a sharper emotional punch, and subtext on loss feels slightly repetitive rather than layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh imagery like "phantom fragrance," but some phrases feel overly ornate, and emotional nuance in Tiber's reactions occasionally leans toward stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the gallery and countdown, leaving a lingering thought on memory, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
