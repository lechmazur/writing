<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tiber's eccentricity as a cartographer is intriguing, but his motivations feel somewhat abstract and lack depth in personal stakes; his reactions to pruning and the manual are symbolic but not emotionally revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with pruning as a metaphor for leadership burdens, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between workshops and the Navigatorsâ€™ recruitment is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panels create a striking, evocative contrast, enhancing the tone of bittersweet defiance; sensory details are present but could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on leadership and fate with strong symbolism (pruning, orchard), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of personal stakes for Tiber; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping probabilities and secret clubs is original, some metaphors (e.g., "forgotten lung") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like pruning and the orchard, but the style occasionally leans toward abstraction over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on fate, though not powerfully so.</comment>
