<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's portrayal as a bluffing swindler is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation shifts from deception to sincerity too abruptly without sufficient internal conflict or backstory to ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the computer restart and Elaraâ€™s arrival lacks clarity, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard inside a toppled skyscraper is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of decay and hidden potential, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of truth and reality, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced character reactions; dialogue feels purposeful but not entirely natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the concept of invisible allies offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion, and some descriptions feel generic rather than uniquely evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth and leaving the resolution somewhat unsatisfying.</comment>
