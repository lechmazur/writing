<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Elara show potential with her "ruthless flower arranger" trait influencing her aggressive precision, but her motivations shift without deep exploration; Tiber's depth is hinted at but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete with a clear beginning and resolution, but the spontaneous road trip method feels slightly forced and pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional shifts at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and ties well to the watcher’s burden, enhanced by sensory details like the singer’s verses; however, the atmosphere occasionally lacks depth in connecting to character motivations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on ambiguity and presence, with decent use of symbolism (e.g., the comb as an anchor), but dialogue feels stilted at times and the emotional impact is not fully realized due to telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on decoding rock art, some metaphors (e.g., "gravel voice") are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or deeply shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the stone circle and road trip, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
