<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Tiber’s focused collector nature shaping his solitude, but his motivations lack depth beyond battling despair; reactions to the black rose are symbolic yet underexplored, missing emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the party; the invitation drives the story forward, though its impact on unraveling solitude is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The frost giant’s lair is evocative and contrasts well with the party, enhancing solitude’s tone, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion in the setting’s atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the black rose symbolism and despair as a predator, but emotional resonance is surface-level; dialogue is purposeful but not particularly natural or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is middling; while the frost giant’s lair and board game rounds are creative, the hermit trope and despair metaphor feel familiar without subversion; emotional handling leans toward telling over showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the board game, but it lacks the depth and polish for top-tier publication; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
