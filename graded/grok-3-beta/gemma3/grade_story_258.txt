<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation to preserve indigenous dances is clear, but his "physically metaphysical" attribute feels underdeveloped and does not distinctly shape his actions or personality beyond vague mysticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, and the action of prancing drives the resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The surreal setting of a drifting orchard is evocative and enhances the mystical tone, with strong sensory details like groaning driftwood, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels somewhat arbitrary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on cultural erasure and memory, with effective symbolism in the wooden birds, but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional telling over showing, particularly in Tiberâ€™s reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its surreal premise and cultural focus, but some metaphors (e.g., "lighthouse in his heart") feel generic, and emotional nuance is inconsistent, occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about loss and revival, but stylistic choices sometimes lean toward over-ornamentation, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
