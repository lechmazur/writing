<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's empathic nature and blacksmith background are well-integrated into his actions, but his motivations lack depth beyond a generic sense of duty; his "steadily free" attribute feels underexplored in shaping his personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of mollifying driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is evocative and complements the tone of sorrow, with sensory details like dust-laden windows enhancing mood, though the timeframe's impact feels vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through symbolism of the hummingbird ornament and heartbeat rhythm, but the theme of humanity's lingering heart lacks sharper subtext or a truly memorable ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining elements like heartbeat syncing and a dollhouse museum, some metaphors (e.g., "blacksmith of the soul") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally leans on ornate phrasing that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not a profound one.</comment>
