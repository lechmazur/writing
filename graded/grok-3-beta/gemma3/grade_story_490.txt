<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's fading caretaker role and methodically random nature are intriguing, but his motivation feels abstract and lacks emotional grounding; his reactions to discoveries don't fully reveal deeper layers of personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to digital transcendence is clear within the word limit, with hacking archives driving the narrative logically, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The caravan repair station and post-wave shoreline create a vivid, desolate atmosphere that complements the tone of enthusiastic apathy; sensory details like lavender scent are evocative, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts curiosity with its digital diaspora concept and has symbolic depth with the lavender, but emotional impact is muted by Tiber's detachment; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a stronger visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise of uploaded consciousness is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "newborn galaxy") feel slightly overused; emotional portrayal leans toward stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, though the style is distinct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering question about consciousness, but the abstract style occasionally hinders clarity and emotional resonance; the brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
