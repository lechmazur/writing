<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Esme's motivation to preserve digital lives is clear and aligns with her role as a glamorous undertaker, but her personality lacks depth beyond surface traits like violet ensembles; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the unique premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (paint mixing), middle (restoring Tiber’s profile), and end (reflection on preservation), but pacing feels uneven, with rushed emotional beats and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is intriguing and supports the concept of digital preservation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of jubilant remorse feels inconsistently conveyed against the gray server backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of preserving memory, with some effective symbolism (blue paint vs. gray servers), but the impact is diluted by overt telling of emotions rather than showing, and the ending lacks a sharp, lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original take on digital preservation, avoiding overt clichés, with fresh metaphors like "elongating" digital lives; however, some descriptors (e.g., "messy tapestry") feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the brass measuring tape, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
