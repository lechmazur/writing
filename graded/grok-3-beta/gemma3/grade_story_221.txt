<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Tiber's melancholic yet joyful nature and unique ghost-whispering ability, but motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; stepping out of family shadows lacks depth in execution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, and the connection between beginning and end, while present, lacks a stronger causal link to feel fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like peeling paint and ghostly cotton candy scent, enhancing the melancholic tone, though the timeframe's integration feels less impactful on atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a subtle emotional response through the theme of thawing hearts, with effective symbolism in the amber, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a sharper punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the ghost-whispering wreck-diver concept, but some emotional descriptions lean on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; metaphors like "tiny sun" feel slightly overused, reducing freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like amber and carnival, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly unique one.</comment>
