<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Tiber’s isolation and grief are clear, but his motivations feel underdeveloped and his shift in perspective lacks depth or gradual build-up, making it seem abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but lacks a strong arc; the short-circuit action drives a pivotal moment, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between mapping railways and personal revelation is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Radio Wave Garden setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of lost connections, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the emotional weight of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional impact, particularly with the hairbrush as a symbol, but the ending feels predictable, and the theme of honesty lacks nuanced exploration beyond surface-level realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by a somewhat formulaic emotional arc; metaphors like the “forgotten lines” are apt but not striking, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it integrates elements adequately but doesn’t leave a lasting impression or demonstrate exceptional craft.</comment>
