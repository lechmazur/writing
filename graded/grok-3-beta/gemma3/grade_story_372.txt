<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; Elias's lovelorn nature feels tacked on without emotional grounding, and Zara's indifference is intriguing but underdeveloped. Motivations are present but not fully explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed, with the data cascade revelation overshadowing earlier elements like the spice blend. Coherence is strained by abrupt shifts from culinary to digital apocalypse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The futuristic slum setting is vividly described with neon and grime, enhancing the mood, but sensory details are unevenly applied, and the atmosphere doesn't fully support the characters' emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with the data avalanche metaphor, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing. Dialogue feels purposeful but stiff, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the concept of digital collapse is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar cyberpunk tropes without subversion. Imagery like "digital snow" feels generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced together rather than organically integrated. Style is competent but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels like a constraint, not a choice.</comment>
