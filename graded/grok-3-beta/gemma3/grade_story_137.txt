<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn the language of the heart is clear, but Tiber's personality as a subtle illusionist feels underexplored in action; his casually intense demeanor lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of rekindling is logical but pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
