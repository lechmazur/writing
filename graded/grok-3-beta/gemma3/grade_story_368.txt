<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s streetwise orphan background shapes her resilience and resourcefulness, but her inner emotional transformation feels underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the brooch’s revelations, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on loss and hope through symbolism of the brooch, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of the brooch offers originality, some metaphors feel slightly overused, and emotional handling leans toward explicit statement rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
