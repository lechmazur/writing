<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's shifty nature and spontaneous attribute are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to unify his children feels sincere but lacks depth in execution due to limited insight into his past or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's reliance on mineralizing grief as a central action is intriguing but feels forced and underexplained, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in theater setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of anguished joy, with strong visual imagery, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has moments of emotional impact and symbolism (grief as stone), but the ending feels incomplete, and the theme of failure's beauty is stated rather than shown through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of mineralizing sorrow is original, and metaphors like the geode are fresh, but the narrative leans on somewhat predictable reconciliation tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the microscope and circus caravans, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
