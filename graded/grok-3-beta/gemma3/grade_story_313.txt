<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Tiber's "unusually normal" trait feels underexplored and his motivation to taunt defeat is intriguing but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between interrogating ghosts and taunting defeat could be more logically reinforced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly rendered and complements the tone of mild fervor, enhancing the ghostly interactions, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes curiosity but lacks strong emotional resonance; the theme of resilience is present but not deeply layered, and the ending feels more conclusive than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers a unique angle with ghostly interrogations, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptions feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it lacks the profound depth or lingering impact required for top-tier publication; style is clear but not distinctive.</comment>
