<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Tiber’s naivety as a gambler is implied but not deeply explored in actions or decisions, and his motivation to capture light feels more obsessive than consistent with a gambler’s risk-taking nature. Elara lacks depth beyond a reflective surface for Tiber’s emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from hope to acceptance, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the tidal surge and the fading light is underexplored, missing a stronger cause-effect link within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the ocean’s roar and flickering candles, enhancing the atmosphere of impending loss. The mood supports the concept of fading light, though the timeframe of candlelit dinners feels slightly underutilized in grounding the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic emotional response and uses symbolism of light effectively, but the ending feels more resigned than satisfying. Subtext about loss and companionship is present, though dialogue is minimal and lacks distinctiveness to elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on unspoken bargains, some imagery (e.g., “encroaching oblivion”) feels slightly generic. Emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but character reactions lack nuanced depth, and the tone wavers slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style occasionally leans toward over-description, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is present but not profoundly memorable.</comment>
