<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, with Tiber’s sullen nature and bias against hope driving his desperate turn to stamps and the quilt, but his sudden shift to inspiration feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the quilt and stamps creatively tied to the action, but the leap to rebuilding an underwater power station feels implausible and rushed, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The underwater city setting is evocative and ties to the concept of erasing boundaries, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully amplify Tiber’s motivation or the story’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with stamps and quilt as metaphors for connection and renewal, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining stamps and quilt as tools for rebirth, but reliance on predictable redemption tropes and generic descriptors for emotion and setting dulls uniqueness; writing style feels occasionally forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is weakened by underdeveloped emotional resonance.</comment>
