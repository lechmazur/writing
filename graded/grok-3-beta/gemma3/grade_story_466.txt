<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's morally ambiguous nature is intriguing, but his motivation to "corner destiny" feels vague and lacks depth in execution; his personality influences actions, yet his voice and reactions remain somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with xerographing driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between grocery shopping and the tower exploration is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of gentle chaos; sensory details like dust motes and old paper enhance atmosphere, though the grocery store timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on hidden histories, with decent use of symbolism (sunflower), but lacks strong emotional resonance or a fully satisfying ending; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining vintage seed packets and decoding forgotten history, with fresh imagery, but some phrases feel slightly formulaic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally lacks clarity; the brief length works, yet it doesn't leave a strong lingering impact or depth beyond the surface.</comment>
