<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's nervousness and insincerity are well-integrated into his actions, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the photograph's emotional weight is stated rather than deeply felt, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of escaping driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some causal links, like Rix’s role, are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bacteria-powered city is vividly realized with sensory details like bioluminescent veins and decay, enhancing the atmosphere of cautious revelry, though the timeframe’s integration with setting feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Tiber’s longing, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, the emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, and some metaphors, like the photograph as a beacon, feel slightly clichéd.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
