<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Auberon's rebellion against rigid structures, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "dazed noble" trope; actions align with motivation, yet his voice feels indistinct and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of chalking messages drives the story but lacks a stronger resolution or consequence, leaving pacing uneven and coherence slightly disrupted by abrupt thematic shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the sound garden is evocative and ties to the tone of quiet rebellion, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation or the story's deeper themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story prompts some thought with cryptic messages and subtext, but emotional impact is muted; imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying or purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, metaphors like "cosmic dance" feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable rebellious noble tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only mild lingering impact.</comment>
