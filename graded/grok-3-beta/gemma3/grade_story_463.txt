<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Tiberâ€™s dry wit is implied but not vividly shown through dialogue or action, and his motivation to contain sorrow feels stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but the arc feels incomplete; the confiscation action drives the story minimally, and pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like salt and regret, and the haunted lighthouse setting complements the tone of eroding promises, though the connection to character motivation feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolism in the rope, but emotional resonance is limited by telling over showing; the ending lacks a strong punch, and dialogue feels functional rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable themes of broken promises and a somewhat generic handling of grief; metaphors like holding back the tide are overused, and emotional nuance is lacking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but not in a transformative way, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
