<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber’s jovial nature feels underdeveloped and contradicted by his deep grief; motivation to endure for Wren is clear but lacks depth in execution. His interaction with the earring reveals loss, yet his voice and personality remain somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; enduring grief via metronome drives the story but lacks a stronger resolution. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional progression and some logical gaps in Silas’s role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The attic setting enhances the mood of regret and isolation, with sensory details like ozone effectively used. However, the connection between setting and timeframe feels underexplored, slightly weakening atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through Tiber’s grief, with decent use of symbolism (earring, metronome). Yet, the conflict feels understated, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying impact; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in the metronome method, but emotional handling occasionally feels stated rather than shown. Metaphors are somewhat fresh, though the narrative risks predictability in its grief trope without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced. Style supports clarity but lacks distinct flair. Brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
