<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, transitioning from control to liberation, but Elias lacks a distinct voice and depth in reactions; his shift feels more stated than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a discernible shift from imprisonment to freedom, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, and cause-effect links are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the ancient Indian temple enhances the mystical tone and complements the concept of broken constellations; sensory details are evocative but sparse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases feel ornate and overworked; emotional nuance is present but inconsistent, occasionally leaning on explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally hinders clarity with dense prose; it leaves a lingering thought on freedom, though not powerfully so.</comment>
