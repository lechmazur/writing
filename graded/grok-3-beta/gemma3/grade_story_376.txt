<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Eira show potential with unique traits (rogue fortune teller with a focus on emotional archiving), but motivations feel underdeveloped; Valerius’ desperation lacks depth beyond surface-level grief, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the unspoken offer drives tension, but pacing is uneven, with the ending resolution feeling abrupt and lacking a stronger emotional payoff within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the reimagined Viking longhouse is evocative and ties well to the atmosphere of hushed melancholy; sensory details like resin scent stand out, though some elements feel underutilized in enhancing mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a subtle emotional response through the theme of preserving feeling, with effective imagery (amber inkwell glowing), but dialogue feels stiff and subtext, while present, lacks deeper resonance or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable emotional beats and somewhat generic descriptors (e.g., “fragile peace”); while the concept of emotional archiving is fresh, execution lacks surprising twists or truly unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constrained by length rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought of remembrance, yet lacks the polish and depth for top-tier impact.</comment>
