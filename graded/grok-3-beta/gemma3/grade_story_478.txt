<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maeve's critical nature as a midwife is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation to recover stolen memories is clear, but her personality lacks distinctiveness beyond the secretive trait, which feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of transcending driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between Silas’s actions and Maeve’s journey lacks full clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard island in a maelstrom is vividly described and enhances the story’s mood of isolation and chaos; sensory details like the "sickly silver" moonlight are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of longing and loss, with imagery like the storm as a repository of selves adding depth, but the ending feels more declarative than emotionally resonant, and the central conflict lacks a sharper resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of memories fragmented in a storm is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "map of weathered calm") feel familiar, and emotional depth is stated more than shown, missing nuanced human complexity at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the maelstrom and diaries, but the style occasionally leans toward overwriting, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
