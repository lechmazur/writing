<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's portrayal as a wayward apothecary is intriguing, with clear motivation to track butterflies for remedies, but his "unjustly fair" trait feels underexplored and lacks impact on his decisions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the butterfly tracking leading to a romantic connection, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the navigation manipulation subplot lacks sufficient grounding or consequence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with bioluminescence and brass details, enhancing the atmosphere of wonder, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the unconventional romance, with some effective imagery around butterflies, but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks depth or tension within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of Morse code romance is original, the narrative leans on steampunk tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like butterflies and Morse code, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
