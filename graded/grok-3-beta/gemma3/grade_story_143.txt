<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber’s fidgety nature is reflected in his frantic hammering, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped; motivation to hold chaos at bay feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc of remaking ward stones is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory ruins create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like scent and trembling plants; the single star timeframe adds poetic weight, though its integration feels slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of defiance against oblivion, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; imagery is effective, though the ending feels predictable rather than striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements like keys and regrowth, but sensory details occasionally feel generic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered, risking a formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, though they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; the brief length works, but lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, contained piece.</comment>
