<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's frantic nature and obsession with history over cooking are intriguing, but his motivation feels overly abstract and lacks personal grounding, making his actions seem more plot-driven than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with Tiber's subversion driving the narrative, but the pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between the beginning and resolution is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility and centuries of dust create a compelling, dusty atmosphere that supports the concept of forgotten truths, though sensory details are sparse and could be more evocative to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about reality and illusion, with some effective symbolism (forgotten letters), but the ending feels predictable, and the lack of dialogue or nuanced 'showing' over 'telling' limits emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of suppressed frequencies is unique, the narrative relies on somewhat generic descriptors and lacks fresh metaphors; Tiber's reasoning feels overly logical, missing human emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with abstract phrasing; the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
