<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Tiberâ€™s secretive nature is clear, but his motivations feel surface-level and underexplored within the word limit, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the search for lost technologies and the romantic subplot is underdeveloped, leading to a lack of coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bird sanctuary setting is evocative with sensory details like disinfectant and feathers, but its connection to the core concept of lost technologies feels tenuous, and the atmosphere only partially supports the edgy nostalgia tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the crayon doodle symbolism, but the emotional resonance is weakened by overt telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable romantic tension and generic descriptors; while the crayon doodle method is creative, the overall narrative lacks fresh subtext and relies on familiar tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive enough for its length but feels constrained rather than deliberate; creative elements are present but not fully integrated, leaving a mild impression without lingering depth.</comment>
