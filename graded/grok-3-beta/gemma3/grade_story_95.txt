<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brother Theron's weariness and linguistic obsession are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the central motivation; the "timidly loud" attribute feels underexplored in shaping his voice or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between fairy tales and storm data is intriguing yet not fully logical or cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm chasing headquarters and storm atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like ozone and dust, enhancing the mood, though the ancient-modern blend feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has symbolic depth with storms as language, but the emotional impact is muted; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a stronger punch; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of storms as language is original, but the execution relies on somewhat predictable mystic-scholar tropes; sensory details are specific, yet emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so, within the brief length.</comment>
