<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but the connection between weaving a disruption and escaping feels conceptually vague, lacking clear cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Mirage Oasis setting and festival timeframe create a vivid backdrop with strong sensory details like fireworks and smoke, enhancing the desperate tone, though the setting's connection to technology feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of resistance, but the symbolism of the tapestry and dialogue feels heavy-handed, lacking subtlety or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a digital labyrinth is somewhat original, but the execution relies on familiar dystopian tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like "digital tide" feel generic rather than striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
