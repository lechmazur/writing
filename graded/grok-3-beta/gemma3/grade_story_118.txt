<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Thorne's peculiarity is intriguing but underdeveloped; Lyra's motivation feels vague despite the emotional weight of hindsight, lacking depth in reaction to the charger plug.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the concept of hindsight drives the narrative, but causal links between actions and outcomes are somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret agent facility and night air timeframe set a charged mood, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere and connect setting to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Symbolism with wax shapes is compelling but overexplained; emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending lacks a strong punch despite thematic potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in the concept of temporal echoes, but reliance on genre tropes like secret agents and time manipulation feels predictable; metaphors are occasionally fresh but not consistently nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesion is adequate with assigned elements, but the story feels constrained by its length rather than deliberately concise; lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond surface narrative.</comment>
