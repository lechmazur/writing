<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's "openly private" nature is hinted at but not deeply explored; his motivation to escape mundanity is clear but lacks specificity in emotional depth or backstory, making his transformation feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with rejuvenation driving the narrative, but the method (meteorite texture) feels slightly contrived, and pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant’s dining room is evocatively described with sensory details like woodsmoke, enhancing the atmosphere of gentle turmoil, though the "rush hour" timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through its theme of acceptance, with effective imagery (dust motes, cosmic energy), but lacks a strong central conflict and deeper subtext, leaving the impact somewhat muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in its interpretation of rejuvenation, the language occasionally leans on generic descriptors, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown, lacking a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like silence and the meteorite, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaborate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
