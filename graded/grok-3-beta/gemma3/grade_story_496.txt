<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a repressed poet with lingering doubts is clear, but Tiber's personality lacks depth beyond the surface trait of "weathered"; reactions to the perfume bottle and ambush feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The spontaneous decision to explore drives the plot forward, and the arc feels complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts and the ambush feels slightly disconnected from prior buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the tone of decay and renewal; atmosphere supports Tiberâ€™s quest, though the timeframe reference feels underutilized and disconnected from the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (perfume bottle as cosmos) add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; central conflict is present but lacks intensity within the brief scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some originality in the concept of capturing essence in a bottle, and metaphors are mostly fresh, but emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext; tone is consistent but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly, and brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
