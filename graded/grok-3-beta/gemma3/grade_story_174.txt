<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation tied to regret over a past failure is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single event; his "theoretically creative" attribute feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from regret to quiet redemption is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between frost patterns and inward fireworks lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hidden library in a waterfall creates a striking, immersive atmosphere that supports the tone of introspection, though sensory details are unevenly applied, missing opportunities to deepen the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective emotional response through themes of impermanence and regret, with strong imagery like frost and leaves, but the central conflict feels understated, and the ending lacks a sharper, more memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of inward fireworks is original, some metaphors (e.g., "firework of the soul") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with a thoughtful blend of elements, leaving a lingering sense of quiet redemption, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
