<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear, with Lyra’s drive to rewrite her brother’s silence being poignant, but Tiber’s apathy feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond a surface trait; their voices are distinct but not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with Lyra’s action of displacing silence driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a stronger causal link to the beginning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen setting is vividly described with sensory details like burnt sugar and heat, enhancing the mood of regret, though the connection between setting and the hourglass feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Lyra’s quest for closure, with effective imagery like the swirling hourglass, but the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of rewriting silence is original, some metaphors (e.g., “cosmic silence”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but not wholly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the hourglass, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
