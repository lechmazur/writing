<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tiber’s pragmatic nature and ambition to become a force of nature are clear, but his shift to exploiting sorrow feels underdeveloped and lacks nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from small comforts to unsettling miracles is coherent, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between hammer echoes and reality-bending is underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village enhances the eerie tone effectively, with strong sensory imagery of twisted branches, though deeper integration of setting with character actions is missing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the hammer’s song, but it lacks the depth and polish for top-tier publication, leaving only a moderate lingering impact.</comment>
