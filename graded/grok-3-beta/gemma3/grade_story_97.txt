<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation to find forgotten places within people is clear and aligns with his role as a fact-minded oracle, but his "desperately casual" attribute feels underexplored in shaping his actions or voice, lacking depth in personality beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between Tiber’s actions and the broader stakes of the dimension weakening is underdeveloped, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unstable dimension and timeframe are vividly rendered with evocative details like "lavender and grey" vortexes, enhancing the mood of optimistic desperation, though sensory immersion could be deeper to fully ground the abstract setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Tiber’s quiet witnessing of grief, with effective imagery like the compass pointing inward, but lacks a stronger central conflict or deeper subtext, leaving the impact somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of empathy through heartbreak-induced visions offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "cracked the wall") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the brass compass, but the style occasionally leans on abstract language over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting lingering impact.</comment>
