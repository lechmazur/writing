<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, driven by a need to understand sacrifice against a backdrop of family legacy, but Tiber's personality feels underdeveloped beyond this obsession; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced traits beyond the zealotry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a subtle resolution in Tiber’s realization, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the focus on individual currencies slows momentum, and the connection between action and broader narrative feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The strange attractor laboratory setting is intriguing and supports the tone of temporal ambiguity, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion; atmosphere aligns with motivation but lacks vividness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on sacrifice with effective symbolism in the currencies, and the theme of personal loss is clear; however, emotional impact is somewhat muted by a lack of showing over telling in key moments, and the ending feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original in its concept of currencies as vessels of forgotten wishes, avoiding overt clichés, but some descriptions (e.g., “fragile peace”) feel generic; emotional handling shows nuance, though the narrative tone occasionally shifts, lacking a fully distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, style occasionally overreaches with abstract phrasing, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is thoughtful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
