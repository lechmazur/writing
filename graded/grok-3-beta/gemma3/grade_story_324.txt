<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tiber's insecurity as an advisor is evident and drives his obsessive pursuit, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level fear of irrelevance; reactions to the brain in a jar feel more plot-driven than character-revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of disrupting the simulation driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between Tiber’s actions and the outcome are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret agent headquarters and simmering future timeframe create a compelling backdrop, with sensory details like the chipped Formica enhancing atmosphere; however, the setting’s connection to the brain in a jar feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and prompts thought about reality versus simulation, with effective symbolism in the brain as a mirror of Tiber’s hopes; yet, the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a dreamer’s calling offers some originality, the story leans on familiar sci-fi tropes of forbidden tech and existential doubt without significant subversion; metaphors like “fractured idyll” feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering uncertainty, though not a profoundly memorable impact.</comment>
