<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s overzealous nature is well-defined and drives his actions, but his deeper motivations lack nuance; the shift from frantic to reverent feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the climax with the woman and apple is rushed, and causality between events is somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard setting is vividly realized and complements the tone of chaotic organization; sensory details are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped character shifts prevent it from achieving true depth or lingering impact.</comment>
