<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to master silence is intriguing but underdeveloped; Tiber's "wide-eyed conjurer" trait feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping his actions or personality beyond a vague descriptor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with resistance driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and the connection between hijacking messages and broader impact remains tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underwater city setting within a bioluminescent jellyfish is vividly realized with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere and complementing the bittersweet tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through themes of quiet rebellion, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly satisfying ending; writing style is competent but not distinctive enough to elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some originality in the setting and method of resistance, but character emotions are often stated rather than shown, and the narrative leans on familiar tropes of tyranny without fresh subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped aspects; it leaves a lingering thought of resistance, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
