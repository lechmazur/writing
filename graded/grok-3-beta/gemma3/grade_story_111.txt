<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Tiber’s motivations are clear but not fully explored, and his intuitive nature feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit but lacks a strong arc; the connection between beginning and end is present but feels forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of the secret dog park is evocative with strong sensory details like wet concrete, but its connection to the character’s motivation and the object feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the ribbon and ripples, but the emotional resonance is inconsistent, and the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by somewhat predictable themes of loss and acceptance; metaphors like the ribbon are intriguing but not entirely fresh, and emotional handling occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated but often feel like add-ons rather than organic drivers, and the style lacks the polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
