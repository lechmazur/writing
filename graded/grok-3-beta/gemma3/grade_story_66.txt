<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliasâ€™s motivation to find a place of belonging, even if it is nowhere, is clear and consistent, but his personality as a quiet deserter lacks depth in action and voice, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven, and the connection between reconstructing masks and carbonizing them is not fully logical or seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting of the plant communication study is evocative with strong sensory details like damp earth and ash, enhancing the atmosphere of erasure, though the timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic emotional response and uses symbolism effectively with the masks, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the theme of letting go feels underexplored in subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of masks as emotional echoes is intriguing, the narrative occasionally relies on predictable tropes of trauma and healing without subversion, and some metaphors feel slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like masks and ash, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
