<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation to spark curiosity is clear, but his outlaw cowboy poet persona feels underdeveloped, lacking distinct voice or actions that reflect his peculiarity beyond surface eccentricity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with misaligning destiny driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between Society rehearsals and wall shifts are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is vividly rendered with brass-filtered light and shifting walls, enhancing the mood of mystery, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on chaos versus order, with decent imagery like “beautiful, broken edges,” but lacks emotional depth or subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of shifting walls is original, the narrative leans on predictable steampunk tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like runic dice, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a profound lingering impact.</comment>
