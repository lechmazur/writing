<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's amiable nature and gambling background are well-integrated into his motivations, but his obsession with Aeridor feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper emotional nuance or personal stakes beyond a generic sense of justice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and a hopeful resolution, but the pacing feels uneven—key concepts like hydrolysis are introduced too late, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds are evocatively described and tied to the atmosphere of fleeting beauty, enhancing the theme of unbecoming; however, sensory details are somewhat repetitive, focusing heavily on visual elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet hope and uses symbolism effectively (fireflies mirroring Aeridor’s transience), but the central conflict lacks intensity, and the theme of rebirth, while present, isn’t fully explored with emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of unbecoming and the method of hydrolysis are original, but some metaphors (petals falling) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but stated more than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the ledger and fireflies, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
