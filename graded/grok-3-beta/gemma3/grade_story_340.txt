<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Tiber’s pride and motivation to outshine Thorne are clear, but his personality feels surface-level with little nuance or distinct voice beyond generic grumbling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the temporal anomaly concept drives the plot only superficially without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Amazon treehouse city setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t strongly enhance the action or character motivation beyond a basic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is moderate; the central conflict is present but lacks emotional resonance, and while the ending is purposeful, the writing style and dialogue feel functional rather than evocative or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes around exorcists and time anomalies; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks fresh metaphors or a distinct authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated without truly elevating the narrative, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
