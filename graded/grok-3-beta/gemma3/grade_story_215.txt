<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Father Michael’s rattled nature and inwardly social attribute are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to entwine science with wonder feels secondary to the plot rather than a driving force, lacking depth in personal conflict or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the puzzle-solving action, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, but the dance lessons feel like an awkward appendage to the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility setting is well-integrated and enhances the atmosphere of mystery, complemented by the tone of coy aggression; sensory details are sparse but effective when used, though the dance lessons clash tonally with the setting’s sterility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue and reflection on belief versus proof, with some subtext in Evelyn’s guarded research; however, the emotional impact is muted, and the writing leans on telling over showing, especially in Michael’s realization at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining exorcism with scientific inquiry, avoiding overt clichés, though some descriptors (e.g., “sterile halls”) feel generic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored, and the style is clear but lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, though the dance lessons feel forced; it leaves a lingering thought about balancing science and the unseen, but the style is functional rather than striking, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
