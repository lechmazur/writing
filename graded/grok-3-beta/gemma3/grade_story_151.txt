<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's motivation to topple the idol is clear, but his personality as an "awed astronomer" feels underdeveloped; his awe is implied but not vividly shown through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and subtle progression, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the method of using snowflake patterns lacks deeper integration into the narrative's causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and frozen world create a haunting atmosphere, with evocative sensory details like "crystal shadows" enhancing mood; however, the setting's connection to the wedding veil feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (snowflakes as hope) and a thought-provoking moral dilemma add depth, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by a lack of visceral character reaction; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique premise with fresh metaphors like cultivating hope via snowflakes, but some descriptors (e.g., "perfect, terrifying stillness") verge on generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about emotion's worth, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
