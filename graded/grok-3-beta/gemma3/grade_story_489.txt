<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but the unseen observer lacks depth or distinct voice; their actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than personal stakes or nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the lighthouse awakening, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the dancer’s action and the whale’s call lacks clear causality, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is evocative with sensory details like the chipped lens and whale’s call, enhancing atmosphere, but the tone occasionally clashes with the modern whistle’s incongruity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with tradition and memory, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; imagery is present but not consistently striking, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of awakening traditions is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like “primal chord” feel generic, lacking fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length exposes underdeveloped ideas over deliberate brevity.</comment>
