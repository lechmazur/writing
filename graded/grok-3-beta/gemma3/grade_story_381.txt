<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's hushed necromancer trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to map caves feels clear but lacks depth in emotional stakes. Lyra's personality is thinly sketched, missing a distinct voice despite dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with mapping driving the action, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the energy pulses' connection to the plot remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like blue light and humming energy, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone, though the connection to necromancy feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about the cave's secrets, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional resonance; dialogue is functional but not particularly natural or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a necromancer mapping caves is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable discovery tropes, and emotional descriptions are more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like old movies, but the style is uneven, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice; it lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
