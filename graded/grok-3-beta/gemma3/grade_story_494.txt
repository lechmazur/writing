<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Valerius’s arrogance and doubtful confidence are well-portrayed through his internal conflict, but his transformation into humility feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper exploration due to the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from challenge to resolution is clear, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, with Hemlock’s sudden revival lacking sufficient buildup or nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is evocatively described with sensory details like rustling bamboo, enhancing the melancholic tone, though the connection between setting and tapestry feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Valerius’s persistence, with effective imagery like “fragile bloom,” but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a deliberate brevity, showing creative use of elements like the song, but it lacks a truly lingering question or depth that would elevate it to top-tier status.</comment>
