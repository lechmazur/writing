<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to heal Oakhaven is clear and tied to her childhood promise, but her "seraphic" and "unapologetically timid" traits feel inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "overtaking" despair via a scoreboard feels forced and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence and pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined temple and post-factory timeframe create a melancholic atmosphere that supports the theme of healing, though sensory details are sparse and the setting’s connection to the arcade feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of collective healing, with some effective symbolism (quilt, ribbon), but the ending lacks punch and the conflict feels understated for the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of healing via a scoreboard is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable emotional beats and generic descriptors, lacking nuanced subtext or a truly distinctive style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style feels overly ornate at times, and the brief length exposes underdeveloped ideas rather than showcasing deliberate restraint.</comment>
