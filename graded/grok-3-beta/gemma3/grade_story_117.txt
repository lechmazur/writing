<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's "wisely foolish" attribute shapes his gentle, curious approach, and his motivation to help ghosts via self-expression is clear, but his personality lacks deeper complexity or conflict, limiting the depth of his character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of naturalizing ghosts driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between melody and ghost release are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted mansion cellar and winter’s end timeframe create a fittingly melancholic atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like damp earth, though the setting’s connection to the magnifying lens feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the ghost’s release and uses imagery effectively, but the theme of self-expression, while present, lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is satisfying but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers some originality in combining elements, metaphors like “tangled ivy” feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the narrative, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a pleasant, contained tale.</comment>
