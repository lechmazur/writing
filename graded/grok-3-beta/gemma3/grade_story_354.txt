<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber's ethereal nature and motivation to chase aurora patterns are intriguing, but his personality lacks depth and distinct voice; his actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than nuanced character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the ricochet action driving resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the wraith's introduction lacks sufficient buildup for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive setting is vividly realized and complements the ethereal tone, enhancing the action, though sensory details are sparse, limiting full immersion in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Tiber's compassion, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels adequate but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like the teddy bear and cosmic disclaimers, but some descriptors feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
