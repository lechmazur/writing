<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marla’s phobia and stunt double career are well-integrated, shaping her internal conflict, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper nuance in reactions to the envelope and net.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between unraveling knots and personal triumph is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pyramid library setting is evocative with strong sensory details like whispers and cold fibers, enhancing the mood, though the connection between setting and envelope feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marla’s confrontation with fear, and symbolism of the net is effective, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and subtext is only moderately developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of unraveling fears via a net is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable phobia tropes without subversion, and some metaphors, like the noose, feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the net and pyramid, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
