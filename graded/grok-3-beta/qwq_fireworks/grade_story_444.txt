<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The fierce ambassador's personality is somewhat defined by her methodical playfulness, but her motivations feel abstract and lack depth; her connection to the ghost costume is poignant yet underexplored, missing a stronger personal stake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the chain of letters driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between indoctrination and shared dreams is conceptually intriguing yet not fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is vividly described with sensory details like salt and decay, enhancing the atmosphere of loss, though the timeframe of radio static feels underutilized and disconnected from the broader mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about illusions and shared myths, with some effective symbolism in the ghost costume, but the emotional impact is muted by underdeveloped characters, and the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying.</comment>
