<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s role as a professional cuddler shapes her internal conflict, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; her shift from shame to acceptance lacks depth in such a short piece. Her voice is distinct in dialogue, though reactions to the ticket punch feel somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the acceptance speech as a climax, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, though the ticket punch’s role in driving the plot feels contrived at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly described with skeletal imagery, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and novelty. Sensory details are strong, but the setting’s connection to the cuddler’s motivation feels tenuous, slightly undercutting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of connection, and the ticket punch as a symbol of forgotten paths is effective. However, the ending feels slightly pat, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique take on touch as taboo, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “ribs of some long-dead creature”) feel familiar. Emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers slightly at the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, though not fully optimized. Creative integration of decay and ancient novelty is notable, but the overall impact lacks the depth for a lingering impression in a competitive market.</comment>
