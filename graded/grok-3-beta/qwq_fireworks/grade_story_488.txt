<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to outshine her reflection and redeem past failure is clear, but the solitary summoner’s personality lacks depth beyond her goal; her voice and reactions feel functional rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the demolition’s role as catalyst is underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quantum beach setting is vividly realized with sensory details and complements the tone of corroded rapture; atmosphere supports the concept, though the condemned building’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the brother’s glimpse, and imagery like origami birds is striking, but subtext is thin; ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper resonance or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept and imagery, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., quantum foam) feel generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully developed, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length works, though depth is sacrificed, leaving only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
