<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation to pursue life’s raw edge through curiosity is clear, but her personality as a "quietly loud" social media exorcist lacks depth and distinct voice; her actions feel more plot-driven than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the receipt driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the ghost’s resolution lacks sufficient buildup for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall settings are evocatively described with strong sensory details (neon glow, echoing boots), enhancing the indifferent yet enthusiastic tone, though the connection between setting and object could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its digital ghost concept, and imagery like “pixelated tears” is striking, but the emotional impact is shallow, dialogue feels stilted, and the theme of curiosity lacks deeper subtext or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a digital exorcism offers some originality, the story leans on genre tropes (ghostly mystery, cryptic clues) without subversion, and metaphors like “buffering video” feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of the receipt and setting, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a lingering question but lacks profound impact.</comment>
