<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a fiercely loyal scout is present but underdeveloped; reactions to the journal feel forced rather than revealing, and the voice lacks distinctiveness despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and connections between coded nonsense and mission clarity are tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the moth observation tower is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of dread, but sensory details are uneven, and the city outage feels underexplored as a mood enhancer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through storms and balance, with some effective symbolism via moths, but emotional impact is diluted by overt explanations and weak dialogue impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable metaphors (storms as turmoil) and generic emotional descriptors; while moths offer a unique angle, the narrative lacks nuanced human emotion and feels formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style often overcomplicates clarity; length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
