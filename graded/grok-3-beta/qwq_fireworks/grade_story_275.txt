<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious and rebellious nature is evident, and his motivation to coax life from barren ground aligns with his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the surface traits; his voice, though distinct in dialogue, feels more functional than unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the translation action driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between comet and growth feels underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting atmosphere that complements the deliberate tone and enhances the hermit's motivation; vivid sensory details like "skeletal trees" and "cometâ€™s roar" immerse the reader, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through imagery and theme of renewal, with strong symbolism in the comet and flowers; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on translating celestial grief into growth, some metaphors like "petals pulsed like supernovas" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; however, the style occasionally leans ornate, hindering clarity, and the lingering impact, while present, lacks the depth for a truly unforgettable impression.</comment>
