<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s role as a dream interpreter is intriguing, but her motivations lack depth and specificity; her actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than personal stakes or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of rewriting laws driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility is vividly rendered with sensory details like iron-tasting air, enhancing the atmosphere, though the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but it lacks a lingering impact or profound depth; creative thinking is evident but not fully realized.</comment>
