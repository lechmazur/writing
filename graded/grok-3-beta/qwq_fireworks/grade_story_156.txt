<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the diplomat's confusion and duty to liberalize, but their personality lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions to the spare key and birds feel functional rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical decision points; the connection between birds’ patterns and liberalization is logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the eerie salt mine village is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like salt sting and flickering lights, enhancing atmosphere; tone complements the joyfully tragic theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on balance versus change, with decent use of symbolism (birds as hierarchy), but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in linking bird patterns to social structure, but metaphors like “chaotic ballet” feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not deeply felt, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the spare key and birds, leaving a lingering question on change versus tradition; style is clear but lacks the polish for top-tier impact.</comment>
