<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The meek necromancer's sincerity is intriguing and shapes her interactions, particularly with the goblin child, but her transformation from meekness to confidence feels abrupt and underdeveloped within the word limit. Motivation to save her sister is clear, yet her inner conflict lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with the riddle's resolution, and the action of regaining the incantation drives the narrative forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between dew drop reflection and tapestry unraveling is conceptually interesting but not fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi and playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone. Sensory details like damp stone and flickering glow immerse the reader, though the connection between setting and object (pen) feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity through the riddle and tapestry imagery, with some effective symbolism in light and shadow. However, the emotional impact of the sister’s plight is underexplored, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch. Dialogue with the goblin feels slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique take on necromancy and riddles, avoiding some clichés, but the transformation trope feels predictable. Metaphors like “thread that light forgets” are fresh, yet some descriptions (e.g., “clarity of dawn”) verge on generic. Emotional nuance is present but not fully shown through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the dew drop and tapestry, and the brief length suits the mystic simplicity. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound afterthought.</comment>
