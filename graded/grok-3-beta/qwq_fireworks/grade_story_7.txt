<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to breach sacred boundaries is clear, but the sentient doll collector's personality feels underdeveloped beyond resignation and duty; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the cane or dolls.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the cane's dissolution lacks sufficient buildup or explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the nectar collection facility is vividly realized with sensory details like blooming stardust and clinking vials; atmosphere supports the ethereal tone and motivation, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through themes of boundaries and choice, with strong imagery like nectar crystallizing into constellations; however, emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character depth, and the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining ethereal and gritty tones, with fresh metaphors like star paths; yet, some descriptions (e.g., "liquid so bright") verge on generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about boundaries; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and brevity sometimes undermines depth.</comment>
