<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila’s vendetta as a candy sculptor is clear and drives her actions, but her emotional depth feels surface-level; reactions to the locket and her mother’s return lack nuanced complexity, relying on stated pain rather than shown struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the counterattack via gingerbread as a clever climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between photographs and the hidden continent is somewhat forced, lacking seamless cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the rebellious tone and complements Lila’s scorn, with dim lanterns and candy sculptures creating evocative atmosphere; however, sensory details are sparse beyond visuals, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Lila’s loss and reunion, with symbolism in candy as rebellion, but the ending feels overly tidy, lacking lingering tension; subtext is present but not fully layered, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining candy sculpting with rebellion, but metaphors like “sugary masterpiece” feel slightly generic; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and while not formulaic, the mother’s return borders on predictable trope without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the locket and candy, leaving a faint lingering thought of legacy; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
