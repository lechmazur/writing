<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the knight's regret driving his actions, but the "grudgingly sweet" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance; the knight's voice is distinct but underdeveloped due to limited dialogue or internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the impossible choice driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks clarity in cause-effect logic, leaving the transformation abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere that enhances the tone of regret and isolation; sensory details like the cold brass and mirrored reflections are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through the knight's regret and final release, with strong symbolism in mirrors and the reef, but the ending feels slightly unsatisfying due to vague resolution; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on regret and impossible choices, some metaphors (e.g., "reefâ€™s teeth") feel slightly overused; emotional handling shows nuance in action but occasionally states feelings directly, missing deeper subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering emotional impact, though not profoundly thought-provoking.</comment>
