<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the exorcist’s stage fright and past trauma, but motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from fleeing demons to toy assembly lacks depth in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between beginning and end is present but not fully cohesive due to abrupt emotional resolutions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of orbital debris is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation; however, the integration of toy assembly into the tone feels slightly discordant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through imagery and subtext of inheritance, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch; literary devices like the flower as talisman are intriguing yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique blend of exorcism and space, but some metaphors (e.g., “tiny sun”) feel slightly generic; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative integration of elements and a lingering sense of redefined inheritance, but cohesion suffers from uneven pacing and underdeveloped character depth; style supports clarity but lacks polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
