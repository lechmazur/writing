<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the "dreamy poet" and "formally rebellious" traits are present but not fully explored through nuanced actions or inner conflict, leaving motivation somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and some riddle-solving steps lack logical grounding, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details of the disused railway station and ivy enhancing the mood; however, the timeframe integration feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has impact through strong imagery and symbolism (sundial, quill), but emotional resonance is inconsistent, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional reliance on familiar gothic tropes (spectral figures, forgotten pasts) without subversion; metaphors are fresh in places but sometimes overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it struggles with depth and emotional weight; the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
