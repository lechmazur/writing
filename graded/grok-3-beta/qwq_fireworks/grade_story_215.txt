<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Father Ignatius’s rattled nature and inwardly social trait are hinted at but not deeply explored, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the postcard beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by puzzles and synthesis, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like the machine’s purpose) remain vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively eerie and tense, with the psychic research facility enhancing the tone of coy aggression; sensory details like fluorescent lights and jazzercise sounds immerse, though deeper setting-character synergy is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has impact through symbolism (Möbius strip, starlight) and subtext of atonement, but emotional resonance is limited by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in combining exorcism with science, but some metaphors (demons whispering truths) feel overused; emotional handling lacks nuance, and tone shifts slightly with Voss’s dialogue, hinting at formulaic transitions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering question about scars, though depth feels constrained by the brief length.</comment>
