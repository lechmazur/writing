<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the undertaker's drive to contain darkness, tied to tribal knowledge and personal loss, but the portrayal lacks depth; his weariness is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from problem to resolution within the word limit, driven by the action of imprisoning darkness, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ancient Persian palace setting is vividly described with sensory details like turquoise domes and sand-worn tilework, enhancing the mystical atmosphere and complementing the tone, though the timeframe's impact feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response through the undertaker's struggle, with effective imagery like sunlight piercing the clock, but the ending feels predictable and lacks profound subtext or a lingering thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique blend of tribal lore and celestial mechanics, some metaphors (e.g., "fragile prison of light and rust") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is limited to surface-level descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a truly lingering thought or depth beyond the explicit plot, falling short of exceptional impact.</comment>
