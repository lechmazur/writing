<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to recover lost recipes is clear, but the broke aristocrat's personality feels underdeveloped; his actions align with the goal but lack depth or distinct voice beyond the generic trope of fallen nobility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of harmonizing tracks driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like the vines pulling him) are abrupt and unexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park and blurry vividness tone create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like elderflower scent and sticky sap; however, the setting’s connection to the recipes feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through the legacy theme, with strong imagery and symbolism (vines as burden), but the ending feels too neat, and dialogue from Mabel, while purposeful, lacks natural cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in blending botanical and ghostly elements, with fresh metaphors like “tracks twisted like a botanical illustration,” but relies on predictable fallen-aristocrat tropes and occasionally overuses ornate language, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the roller coaster and legacy, leaving a lingering thought about burden as growth, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with overly complex imagery, and the brevity feels slightly limiting.</comment>
