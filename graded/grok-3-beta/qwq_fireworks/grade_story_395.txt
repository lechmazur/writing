<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the marshal's dutiful nature is clear, but her rebellious streak feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation beyond plot necessity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between dance and manuscripts is intriguing yet underexplored within the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the dance as a symbolic bridge, but emotional resonance is shallow, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; conflict resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of dance-encoded manuscripts, but reliance on familiar rogue-partner tropes and somewhat generic sensory details dampen uniqueness; tone is mostly consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
