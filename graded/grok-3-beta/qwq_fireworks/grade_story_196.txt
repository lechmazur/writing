<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s fiercely apathetic nature is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from apathy to action lacks depth or gradual build, making his transformation abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with meteors driving the action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between resignation and Kael’s leap are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is vividly realized with sensory details like burnt incense and creaking stones, enhancing the atmosphere of decay, though the setting’s connection to defiance feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imagery of meteors and defiance carries symbolic weight, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a deeper lingering resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the meteor imagery is fresh, the story leans on familiar tropes of rebellion against oppressive systems without subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate metaphors, hindering clarity; it leaves a faint impression rather than a profound one.</comment>
