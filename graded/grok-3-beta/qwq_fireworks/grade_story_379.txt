<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to save dying languages is clear, but the trickster lawyer's personality feels underdeveloped; the "trickster" trait lacks distinct expression in actions or voice beyond generic cunning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the dare-driven progression, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between personal loss and language preservation is underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Biodome setting is vividly realized with sensory details like humming vines and bioluminescent blooms, enhancing the ghostly tone, though the timeframe of "stretching" feels underutilized in atmosphere-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through the sisterâ€™s memory, but literary devices like the gift tag symbolism feel forced; the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, leaving tension unresolved without clear purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining futuristic elements with language preservation, but metaphors like "whispering tongues" are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
