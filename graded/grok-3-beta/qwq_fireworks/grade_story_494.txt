<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arrogance and doubt are well-portrayed through his interactions and internal conflict, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt within the word limit, lacking deeper nuance in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the song and authorization is not fully fleshed out, leaving minor logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and winter atmosphere are evocatively described with sensory details like ink and frost, enhancing the mood of harsh tenderness, though the setting’s connection to the tapestry feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the swordsman’s struggle and uses strong imagery, but the ending feels somewhat predictable, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers some fresh metaphors, it leans on familiar tropes of redemption through heritage without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a truly lingering impact or profound depth beyond the surface narrative, falling short of top-tier memorability.</comment>
