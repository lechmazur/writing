<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a careless pilot is clear, but depth is lacking; reactions to the glove and memories feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional layers or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical but not deeply compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details of the orchard labyrinth and storm, enhancing the mood; setting and tone align well with the concept of borrowed memories, though some connections feel slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with decent use of symbolism (glass tree, glove), but subtext is underdeveloped; ending is satisfying yet lacks profound impact or lingering reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors (e.g., "paths collapsing like shed skin") feel occasionally overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a mild lingering thought, though not deeply memorable or transformative.</comment>
