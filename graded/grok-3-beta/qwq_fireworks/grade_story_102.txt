<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The mercenary's spinelessness is referenced but not deeply explored; his hesitation and final choice lack sufficient internal conflict or backstory to make his motivation compelling or distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the dollhouse key and the prophecy feels underdeveloped, and pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The map projection room and atmospheric details like "hush after the wind" are evocative, but sensory immersion is inconsistent, and the setting's connection to the prophecy remains vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., key as tether) show promise, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels ambiguous without clear purpose or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar mysterious-prophecy tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
