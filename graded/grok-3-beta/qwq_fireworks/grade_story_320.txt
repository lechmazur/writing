<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s shy diviner trait is evident but underdeveloped; her motivation to right the cosmic imbalance feels clear yet lacks depth in emotional grounding, making her actions feel somewhat detached from a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the social media trail driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution of the cosmic imbalance lacks a fully coherent cause-effect link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater market setting is vividly realized with sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and regret motif, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly tied to the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its exploration of regret and choice, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict’s resolution lacks the emotional punch needed for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel timelines and regret is original, some metaphors (e.g., “regret was the lens”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like photographs and timelines, leaving a lingering question about choice, but the style sometimes overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
