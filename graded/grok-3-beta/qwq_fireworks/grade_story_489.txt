<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's "aggressively kind" attribute is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; their urgency feels forced rather than motivated by clear personal stakes. Their voice lacks distinctiveness despite dialogue, and reactions to the whistle are more symbolic than revealing of character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the dancer’s step and whale’s call driving events, but coherence suffers from abrupt shifts (e.g., observer lifted into air). Pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly rendered with sensory details (salt-stained walls, vibrating floorboards) that enhance the eerie atmosphere. The setting complements the tone and action well, though the connection to the dancer’s stage feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mystical response through imagery and symbolism (whale’s call, glowing imprint), but the emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on abstract concepts over character-driven conflict. The ending is purposeful yet lacks a fully satisfying resolution; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, it leans on familiar mystical tropes (cursed lighthouse, ancient wisdom) without significant subversion. Metaphors are fresh in places but occasionally over ornate; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, and the style supports its mystical tone, but clarity is hindered by overly complex imagery at times. The brief length feels deliberate, yet the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped character stakes.</comment>
