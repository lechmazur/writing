<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli's character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, and his motivation to resolve the ghost's unrest is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "elegantly clumsy" trait, which feels superficially applied rather than integral to his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven—rushed at the end with the petal scattering. The connection between Eli’s actions and the ghost’s release is logical, though not fully developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is unique and complements the ghostly atmosphere, with sensory details like the humless vacuum and salt-laden wind enhancing immersion. However, the setting’s connection to the timeframe (lunch breaks) feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the ghost’s release and Eli’s quiet triumph, with effective imagery like “sandcastle crumbling.” However, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme of silence as dissonance, while present, lacks deeper subtext or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining a technician with ghost-seeing and a preservation lab, avoiding overt clichés. Yet, some metaphors (e.g., “fractured whispers”) feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is present but not fully fleshed out, occasionally leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about silence and liberation. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
