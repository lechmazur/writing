<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the cartographer’s perceptive nature is implied but not deeply explored through actions or distinct voice, and her motivation feels more poetic than grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc within the tight word limit; the connection between beginning and end feels forced, and pacing is rushed with insufficient resolution of core tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details like holographic trees and the forge’s clang, but the futuristic hospital setting occasionally overshadows character motives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with strong imagery (dragonfly wings, balloon’s ghost), but emotional resonance is undercut by an unclear central conflict and a somewhat unsatisfying ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors (e.g., “dying star”) and a lack of fresh subversion of tropes; emotional handling feels stated rather than shown at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
