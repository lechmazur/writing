<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evelyn’s curse to speak only truth shapes her interactions, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the politely vindictive trait is present but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between petrification and personal evolution is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone effectively, with strong sensory details like flickering lights and autumn air, though the bird-watching timeframe feels tangential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Evelyn’s cryptic warnings, and symbolism of the tapestry is intriguing, but the dialogue feels stilted and the theme of evolution lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a cursed truth-teller is unique, some metaphors like “tapestry of fate” feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the pencil box and moon phases, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels slightly limiting.</comment>
