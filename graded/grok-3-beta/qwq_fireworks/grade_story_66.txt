<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reconstructor’s motivation to escape cycles of belonging and betrayal is clear, but their personality lacks depth beyond the deserter label; their voice feels muted despite the introspective narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; carbonization as a climactic action drives the story, yet some causal links feel forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plant communication study setting is evocative and enhances the mood of isolation, with sensory details like fogged breath and fluorescent glow; however, timeframe integration feels vague and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on belonging and cycles through strong symbolism (masks, mirrors), but emotional impact is diluted by over-explained themes; ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like “spider’s thought” are fresh, but some imagery feels ornate and detracts from clarity; narrative avoids clichés yet lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like masks and carbonization, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on fracture and belonging, though not powerfully.</comment>
