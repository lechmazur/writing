<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli’s characterization as an unlucky meteorologist is intriguing, but his motivation to study plant behaviors feels underdeveloped and inconsistently tied to his cosmic obsession; his reactions lack depth beyond surface-level responses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the meteor shower as a driving conflict, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the sextant’s role in redirecting meteors strains logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground city of lizard people is vividly rendered with bioluminescent moss and spiraling spires, enhancing the atmosphere, though sensory details are unevenly distributed, and the setting’s connection to Eli’s motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity with its cosmic and cultural clash, but literary devices like “bitter honey” feel heavy-handed; dialogue is functional but lacks distinctiveness, and the central conflict resolves too neatly for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality, metaphors like “moth to a supernova” are somewhat clichéd; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable sci-fi tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a faint lingering thought about trust, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
