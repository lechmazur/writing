<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s sincerity as a rebel is evident, and her motivation to preserve traditions drives her actions, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped; her reactions lack nuanced layers beyond determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the shifting passage driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution of the charter’s oath lacks clear causal impact on the library’s survival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted passage setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like mildew and whispering walls, enhancing the eerie tone, but the connection between setting and Mara’s motivation feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response and uses symbolism (storm’s eye as ritual), but the dialogue with the specter feels stilted, and the theme of bending traditions lacks deeper subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a shifting passage is intriguing, some metaphors (walls peeling like skin) feel overused, and emotional portrayal occasionally leans on telling rather than showing; originality is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly memorable impact; creative thinking is evident but not fully polished for top-tier publication.</comment>
