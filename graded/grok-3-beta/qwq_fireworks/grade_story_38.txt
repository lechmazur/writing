<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the insomniac poet's drive to uncover hidden truths, but her personality lacks depth beyond the insomnia and poetic obsession; reactions to botanical samples feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, connecting the whispers to a resolution, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations at the end; cause and effect are logical but not always compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly haunting, with the attic and subway stops enhancing the eerie tone; sensory details like pulsing petals are evocative, though some setting connections to character motivation feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through imagery and theme of listening, but dialogue feels slightly forced; ending is satisfying yet lacks a deeper punch; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is moderate with fresh metaphors like "tracks built on bones," but some tropes (haunted spaces, buried secrets) are predictable without subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; length feels deliberate, yet impact is muted by uneven depth in character and conflict resolution.</comment>
