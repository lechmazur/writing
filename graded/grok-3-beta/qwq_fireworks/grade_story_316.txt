<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s timid nature is well-integrated into her hesitation and gradual resolve, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the childhood promise with Kael lacks depth to fully anchor her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the connection between typing on the scoreboard and collective healing feels forced and lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere of decay and nostalgia in the shuttered arcade and factory setting is evocative, with strong sensory details like the “thread-stained apron,” though the Greek temple imagery feels somewhat disconnected from the industrial tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of loss and hope through symbolism like the ribbon and scoreboard, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-explained metaphors and a resolution that feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on collective healing via a magical scoreboard, some imagery (e.g., “temple of columns woven from arcade lights”) borders on overwrought, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive narrative with creative integration of elements like the ribbon and scoreboard, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
