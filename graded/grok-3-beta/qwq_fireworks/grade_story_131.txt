<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ember's motivation to honor her mother's legacy and confront fear is clear, but her aloofness as an orphan feels underexplored; her emotional arc lacks depth in reactions beyond surface-level grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the gravitational fix as resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between stones and anomaly resolution lacks sufficient causal grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the tilted roof and drifting basketball, enhancing atmosphere, though the garage's mundane aspects occasionally clash with the surreal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through Ember's connection to her mother, with effective symbolism in the stones, but the ending feels slightly predictable, lacking a deeper subtextual punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of stones as anchors is original, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of inherited destiny without subversion; emotional resonance is present but stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting deeper exploration of themes and character.</comment>
