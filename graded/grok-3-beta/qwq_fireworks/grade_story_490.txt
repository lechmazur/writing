<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra’s motivation to seek forbidden knowledge is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; his voice, while distinct in tone, feels more atmospheric than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the end; hacking as a method fits logically, but the resolution lacks clarity in cause and effect, diminishing coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The caravan repair station and post-wave timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like salt-crust air and lavender scent; however, the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (lavender as talisman, sea as key) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is undercut by overt telling of Ezra’s madness; the ending is intriguing yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors like “gorging on light” are fresh, the story leans on familiar tropes of forbidden knowledge without subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
