<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clara’s vigilance and motivation tied to her sister’s death are clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond determination; her voice feels sharp yet underdeveloped for a top-tier piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc and logical cause-effect with the conspiracy unraveling, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and coherence stumbles with abrupt confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting of the test facility is intriguing and ties to the action, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere doesn’t fully amplify the sardonic tone or tragedy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story has tension and some subtext with the peacock patterns, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending is purposeful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like the seal and aerodynamics, but metaphors (e.g., “conspiracies bloom from roots”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a thought but lacks the polish for immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
