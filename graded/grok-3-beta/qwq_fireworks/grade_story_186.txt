<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zephyrâ€™s whimsical nature is evident in his creations, but his deeper motivations and emotional depth remain underdeveloped, leaving his reactions to mortality somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the thermometer driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed toward the end, and some causal links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace and stalactites create a striking, immersive setting that enhances the tone of impending collapse, though sensory details are occasionally sparse, missing opportunities for deeper atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (thermometer as truth, palace as fragility) and a haunting ending evoke reflection, but emotional resonance is somewhat muted by limited character depth; the theme of mortality is clear but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its concept and setting, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptions verge on ornate, and emotional nuance feels slightly stated rather than shown, hinting at a lack of raw human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of inevitability, but stylistic flourishes occasionally overshadow clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
