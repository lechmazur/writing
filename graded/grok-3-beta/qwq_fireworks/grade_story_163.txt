<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the lost heiress seeking her father’s legacy, but her personality lacks depth beyond bitterness and resolve; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the stub and reality unification are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the xenobiology station and cloud migration creates a striking atmosphere, enhanced by vivid imagery like “prismatic shadows,” though sensory details are unevenly distributed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through the heiress’s purpose, but lacks deeper subtext; dialogue is purposeful but stiff, and conflict resolution feels too neat for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some originality in combining fragmented reality with cloud migration, but metaphors like “alien eggs” are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity limits depth; style is clear yet lacks a lingering question or profound feeling to elevate it beyond surface narrative.</comment>
