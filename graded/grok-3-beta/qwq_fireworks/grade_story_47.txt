<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s dutiful nature and jaded eagerness are evident, but her motivations feel underdeveloped; the connection between her father’s failures and her actions lacks depth, making her arc feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of solving driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution’s logic (floor dissolving, walls splitting) is abrupt and insufficiently grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is vividly realized with a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone; sensory details like silent halls and shattered glass are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and defiance, with strong imagery (glove as ash, scars mapping failures), but the ending feels more theatrical than satisfying; dialogue is sparse but sharp, though emotional depth is often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on mortality and defiance, some metaphors (walls bleeding, mortality as a joke) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuance, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly dramatic prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the glove and voice notes, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering defiance, though not fully polished for top-tier publication.</comment>
