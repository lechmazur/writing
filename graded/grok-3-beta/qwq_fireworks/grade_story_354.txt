<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to reverse the curse is clear, but the wizard's personality lacks depth beyond the ethereal trait; reactions to the teddy bear feel surface-level and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect between aurora patterns and resolution are logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Virtual reality archive setting is vividly realized with sensory details like flickering data streams; atmosphere supports the chaotic tone, though deeper integration with character motivation is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of compassion; imagery is strong, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining ethereal wizardry with virtual reality, but metaphors like "heat haze over asphalt" are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a faint lingering thought about compassion, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
