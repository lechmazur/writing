<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to step out of family shadow is clear, but the wreck-diver aspect feels underexplored and disconnected from actions; personality lacks distinct voice or depth beyond the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning and resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, but the "thawing heart" concept drives plot unevenly, lacking full integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned carnival gallery is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (frost, peeling posters), enhancing atmosphere and supporting tone; however, timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery and theme of breaking free, with decent use of symbolism (amber, insect); ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying; subtext is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors (amber as joy/loss), but some phrases feel ornate and overdone; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, limiting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of rebellion; however, style occasionally hinders clarity with overly poetic choices, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
