<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli's social awkwardness and inventor background are present but underdeveloped; motivation to overcome regret is clear but lacks depth in execution, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments; the connection between action and concept is logical yet lacks seamless integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-night timeframe create a vivid atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the encrypted archive feels slightly disconnected from the mundane tone of the diner.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the tree of regret metaphor, but the impact is diluted by overt explanation; subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some imagery (e.g., tree of regret) feels familiar; writing style is distinct but occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, lacking consistent originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
