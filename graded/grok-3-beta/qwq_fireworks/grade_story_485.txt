<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes of abandoned labs and genius mentors without fresh subversion; metaphors like “dying star” feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but lacks the polish and depth for a lasting impression; the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
