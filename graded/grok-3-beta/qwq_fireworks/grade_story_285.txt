<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's hesitance and awkwardness are portrayed consistently, shaping his actions and internal conflict, but his deeper motivations remain vague beyond the mission, lacking personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the postcard and crab exchange driving a logical resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a vivid, immersive setting with strong sensory details (crunching ice, hissing steam), enhancing the mood and action, though the tone of rancor feels underexplored in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes awe and reflection through symbolism (crabs as portals, postcard as bridge), with a satisfying ending and clear theme of balance, but emotional depth is shown more than felt, and tension is subtle rather than gripping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining crabs and portals, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptors (e.g., "ashen sky") feel generic, and emotional nuance is present yet not deeply resonant, hinting at formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of possibility, but clarity is occasionally muddled by abstract concepts, and the short length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
