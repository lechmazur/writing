<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mortician's curiosity is evident and drives the narrative, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation to collect dream journals feels clear yet underexplored in emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of imitation driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and spirits’ songs create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory detail; the setting enhances the mystical tone, though its connection to the mortician’s motivation feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and mild wonder through imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but emotional impact is limited by shallow character depth; dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in its surreal elements, metaphors like “rustle of revelation” feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully developed, risking generic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering mystical impression, but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier impact; style occasionally overreaches with ornate language.</comment>
