<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelâ€™s moral code as a hacker shapes his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation is clear but not nuanced, and his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of retrieving a name driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman marketplace is vividly rendered with sensory details and complements the futuristic tone, though the connection between setting and object (bottle caps) feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on history and truth, with some symbolism in the inscriptions, but the emotional impact is muted, and the ending lacks a strong punch despite a clear conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending ancient and futuristic elements, but relies on predictable hacker tropes without subversion; sensory details are specific, though emotional nuance is limited to stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped depth; it leaves a lingering thought on legacy, though style occasionally hinders emotional clarity.</comment>
