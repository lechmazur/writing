<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a repressed poet seeking cosmic verse is intriguing, but the internal conflict feels underdeveloped; reactions to the bottle and ambush lack depth in revealing her terror or ambition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the ambush driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the perfume bottle and cosmic verse is intriguing yet not fully logical or cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overgrown city setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of decay and reclamation; atmosphere supports the poet’s motivation, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through cosmic verse symbolism and has a satisfying ending, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of fear; central conflict is clear, though resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending cosmic themes with urban decay, but metaphors like “walls closing in like jaws” are overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
