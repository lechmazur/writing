<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to Lila’s death and the map fragment is clear, but Elias’s personality lacks depth beyond grief; his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed at the resolution; the short-circuit action drives tension, yet causal links between echo and revelation are tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Radio wave garden setting is vividly surreal with strong sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the water tower and character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through grief and release, with potent imagery, but subtext is uneven; ending satisfies yet lacks deeper resonance or lingering conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending surreal elements, but metaphors like “lightning flashed inside his skull” feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a mild lingering thought, not profound.</comment>
