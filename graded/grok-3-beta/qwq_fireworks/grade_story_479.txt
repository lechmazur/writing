<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation to preserve her family’s tradition is clear, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond her patience and duty. Her voice lacks distinctiveness, and her reactions, while consistent, don’t reveal deeper layers of character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven—rushed at the discovery of the photo. The action of elongating drives the story, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is evocative and enhances the concept of digital afterlives, with strong sensory details like flickering neon lights. However, the atmosphere’s connection to Lila’s motivation feels slightly forced, lacking deeper tonal integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the paradox of joy and loss, with effective imagery like the hydrangea mural. Subtext is present but underdeveloped; the ending is satisfying but not profoundly impactful. Conflict is minimal and resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of digital hauntology is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat predictable metaphors (e.g., funeral bell). Emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown. The style is distinct but occasionally ornate, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the brass tape, but the style sometimes hinders clarity with over-elaborate phrasing. It leaves a lingering thought about memory, though the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
