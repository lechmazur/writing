<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map the cave systems is clear, and the hushed necromancer's personality is shaped by a quiet resolve and nostalgia, but the depth of her emotional connection to the past feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between dominating the path and the final coordinate reveal lacks stronger causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly described with sensory details like glinting walls and dripping water, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone, though the timeframe "between sets" feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a melancholic emotional response through nostalgia and loss, with effective use of movie imagery as symbolism, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict with the creature resolves too quickly to maximize tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the integration of old movies as a method is creative, some metaphors (e.g., "frames in a never-ending film") feel slightly overused, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable nostalgic tropes without fully subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
