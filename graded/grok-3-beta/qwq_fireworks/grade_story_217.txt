<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s underestimated rebel nature is evident, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; her actions with the knife are symbolic yet lack deeper emotional grounding. Her voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out in dialogue or internal thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed toward the resolution. The action of intensifying the ghostly encounter drives tension, yet connections between elements like the taco and the climax feel forced, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly described with sensory details like rust and fog, enhancing the ephemeral gloom. However, the setting’s connection to the characters’ motivations and the taco element feels tenuous, weakening atmospheric immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through grief and adaptation, but it often tells rather than shows, especially in key moments. Imagery like the knife as a talisman is promising but underdeveloped; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt AI-like repetition, it leans on predictable horror tropes without subversion. Metaphors like “corridors twisted like a ribcage” are evocative but not entirely fresh. Emotional nuance is stated rather than deeply felt, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel shoehorned rather than organic. The style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice. It leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
