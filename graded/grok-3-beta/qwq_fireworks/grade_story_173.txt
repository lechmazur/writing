<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map trade routes is clear, but the orchardist’s personality lacks depth beyond her mission; her reactions and voice feel functional rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between reclaiming data and the seed’s revelation is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater city hall setting is vividly described with sensory details like silt-crusted stone and bioluminescent algae, enhancing the bittersweet tone, though the multiverse timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on trade as living stories, with strong symbolism in the seed and leaves, but the emotional impact is diluted by expository moments that tell rather than show.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of living trade routes is original, some metaphors (e.g., “miniature supernova”) feel generic, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the seed and leaves, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea but not a profound impact.</comment>
