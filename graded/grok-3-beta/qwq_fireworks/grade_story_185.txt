<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to prevent timeline collapse is clear, but the "peculiar collector" trait feels underdeveloped; her calmness is noted but lacks depth in shaping her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the tweaking action drives the story logically, though connections between elements occasionally strain coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the probability mapping center is vividly realized and enhances the action; sensory details like humming and flickering holograms immerse, though some atmospheric elements feel disconnected from character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes bittersweet reflection through buried talent theme and uses strong symbolism (pencil snapping), but emotional depth is somewhat told rather than shown; ending is satisfying yet lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in combining futuristic setting with personal loss, but metaphors like "ghost of a melody" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of sacrifice, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
