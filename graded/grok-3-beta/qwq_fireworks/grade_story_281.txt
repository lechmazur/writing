<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jax’s transformation from thief to poet is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift lacks deeper emotional grounding or backstory to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between poetry and transformation is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with sensory details like groaning pistons and flickering gloom, enhancing the eerie tone, though the timeframe feels incidental and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about personal change through strong imagery and metaphor, but the dialogue with the dummy feels slightly contrived, and the theme of transformation lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of poetry as transformation is original, some metaphors (e.g., “wet cloth”) feel generic, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable supernatural tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the dummy and poetry, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
