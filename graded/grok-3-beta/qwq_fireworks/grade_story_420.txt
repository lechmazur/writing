<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation as a hopeful sculptor is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the drive to create; her reactions to the puzzle ring and sculpture feel predictable, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from creation to implosion to rebirth is coherent within the word limit, with the concept of light boundaries driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the collapse, and cause-effect links could be sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry setting with fossilized bones enhances the ancient, quiet atmosphere and ties well to the action of sculpting, with strong sensory details like chisels and wind, though the tone’s shift to excited boredom feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on creation through destruction, with effective imagery like “dying star” and a satisfying ending, but subtext is somewhat surface-level, and the central conflict of light boundaries lacks deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on light and implosion, some metaphors like “shattered ribs” feel slightly overused, and emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing; overall style is distinct but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the ring and bark texture, leaving a lingering idea of breaking boundaries, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
