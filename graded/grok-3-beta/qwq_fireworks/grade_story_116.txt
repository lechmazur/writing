<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The minstrel’s subjective rationality shapes their actions, but their motivation feels vague and inconsistently tied to dismay; reactions to objects like the watchband lack depth in revealing character, and their voice isn’t distinct enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of excavating driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and some cause-effect links, like the descent, are abrupt and unclear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The black velvet sky-lounge and endless city create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details of night and fog; the setting supports the garden secrets well, though the tone’s exuberance occasionally jars with the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has strong imagery, like thorns blooming from photos, with layers of subtext about time and memory; however, the ending feels more confusing than satisfying, and dialogue lacks naturalness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in combining elements like Polaroids and living maps, metaphors like “endless night” feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering question about time, though not powerfully so.</comment>
