<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s telepathy and tragic joy shape her actions, but her motivation feels slightly abstract; the girl’s role lacks depth beyond a symbolic connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet pacing stumbles with abrupt shifts in focus within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like hissing pipes and coal smoke; atmosphere supports the gloomy cheerfulness, though setting-action integration could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (ink as truth) are effective, and the ending lingers, but emotional resonance is undercut by telling over showing; central conflict is clear but resolution feels incomplete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors (e.g., “threadbare truth”) are fresh, but others feel forced; emotional nuance is present yet occasionally stated; overall style is distinct but risks predictability in tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though clarity is occasionally hindered by ornate language.</comment>
