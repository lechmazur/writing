<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a lovelorn spy is clear, driven by grief and a lost lover, but the "curiously indifferent" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance; reactions to the sticky label are symbolic but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, driven by the avalanche threat, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between unfamiliar reflections and plot direction is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of futuristic city slums is vividly rendered with sensory details like neon rain and acidic air, enhancing the mood of desperation; atmosphere supports the spyâ€™s grief, though timeframe integration feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through grief and betrayal, with decent imagery, but dialogue feels stilted; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and subtext around reflections lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on cyberpunk tropes without subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and generic descriptors like "metallic tang" reduce originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the sticky label, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; length feels like a limitation, and lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
