<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped; Eli's connection to loss and the sea glass feels more symbolic than personal, lacking depth in his emotional journey or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between decoding microfilm and siphoning radiance is tenuous, lacking clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory and gritty whimsical tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like ozone and engine hums, though the settingâ€™s connection to the sea glass feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through its exploration of loss and doubt, with effective symbolism in the black hole and sea glass, but the ending feels more cryptic than satisfying, and emotional depth is shown rather than told only sporadically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of loss and radiance offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., black hole of doubt) lean on familiar tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like sea glass and the observatory, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
