<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the smuggler's rage and desire to memorialize a lost partner, but the irate nature feels somewhat one-dimensional, lacking deeper nuance or evolution in such a short piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between tea leaves and plot resolution is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like crunching gravel and static wind, effectively enhancing the desolate, biting tone and supporting the smuggler's isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (tea leaves, chopstick) evoke emotion and subtext about loss, but the ending feels slightly unresolved, lacking a fully satisfying emotional punch within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors (heart as bruise, tea leaves as prophecy) are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes of loss and scavenging without significant subversion, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and overall impact.</comment>
