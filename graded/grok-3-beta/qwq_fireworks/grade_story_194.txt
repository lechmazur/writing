<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s spirited nature and lumberjack background are evident, but his motivation to learn healing traditions feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; reactions to the coded letter are compelling yet lack deeper personal nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the ossuary’s secrets driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the gala climax; logical flow is maintained, though some cause-effect links are superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ossuary-turned-restaurant is vividly realized and enhances the tone of harsh tenderness; sensory details are strong, though some atmospheric elements feel secondary to plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through its war-healing dichotomy and uses symbolism effectively (bones as memory); ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying; dialogue is functional but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the ossuary-restaurant concept, but some metaphors (e.g., “restless fireflies”) feel slightly generic; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; brief length works, yet depth is somewhat sacrificed; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
