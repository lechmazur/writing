<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira’s introversion and dancer background are intriguing but underexplored; her motivation to escape feels clear but lacks depth in emotional grounding or backstory, making her actions feel slightly detached from a fully realized personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with knitting driving the narrative forward uniquely, but the resolution feels rushed, and the connection between the wasteland escape and the cipher message lacks clarity in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cipher decoder’s office and wasteland setting are vividly rendered with sensory details like burnt wiring and storm howls, enhancing the desolate tone, though the integration of the timeframe with atmosphere feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity through its unique knitting metaphor, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level character exploration; imagery is strong, yet the ending lacks a deeply satisfying punch or resonant subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The knitting-as-code concept offers originality, and metaphors like “constellations into scarves” are fresh, but some descriptions verge on purple prose, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like knitting and charts, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering image, though not a profound thought or feeling.</comment>
