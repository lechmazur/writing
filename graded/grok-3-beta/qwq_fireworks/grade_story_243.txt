<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The jumpy necromancer's anxiety is evident, but his motivation to unmask the icon feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit; the transition from fear to vigilance lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of faltering ties to the tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly rendered with nostalgic sensory details like staticky air and glitchy skies, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and fishhook feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its revelation, and imagery like pixelated glitches is effective, but the emotional impact is muted, and the theme of truth feels surface-level without deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a necromancer in a digital world is fresh, but some descriptors (e.g., "sharp, jagged sound") feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the mural and fishhook, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
