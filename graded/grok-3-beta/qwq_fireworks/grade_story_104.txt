<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stoic steward's characterization is adequately conveyed through his internal conflict and subtle rebellion, but his motivation lacks depth; it feels more symbolic than personal, limiting emotional investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of venerating driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the cameo and orchard changes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of façade, with sensory details like glass domes enhancing atmosphere, though the timeframe’s impact feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its rebellion theme and uses symbolism effectively with the cameo, but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on conformity, some metaphors (e.g., “lullaby of order”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overall impact is hindered by uneven emotional depth and a style that occasionally prioritizes imagery over clarity.</comment>
