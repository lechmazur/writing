<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s ambition and loyalty are clear, shaping her persistence, but her personality lacks depth beyond these traits; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by deciphering the poster, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional beats and a resolution that lacks full closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere with strong sensory details like “salt and starlight,” though the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses imagery effectively (e.g., “breath on glass”), but dialogue is sparse and lacks nuance; the theme of preserving lost voices is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of lost dialects is original, some metaphors (“broken promises”) feel overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable patterns of loss and discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the straw, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about preservation, though not profoundly so.</comment>
