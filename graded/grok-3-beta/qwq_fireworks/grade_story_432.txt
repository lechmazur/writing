<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation as a poison taster with a death wish is intriguing but underdeveloped; her obsession with mapping energy feels more stated than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of binding energy flows driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the psychic call method introduces a jarring shift in logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall setting is vividly described with sensory details like the roar and cold air, enhancing the atmosphere of serene upheaval, though the ice sculpture’s connection to the setting feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Lira’s sacrifice, and imagery like azure veins is striking, but the ending lacks deeper subtext, and the psychic dialogue feels unnatural and expository.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of energy mapping is original, the story leans on familiar tropes of hidden societies and self-sacrifice without subversion; sensory details are vivid but occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is lacking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the bookmark, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
