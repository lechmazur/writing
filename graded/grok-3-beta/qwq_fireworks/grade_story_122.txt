<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to disprove safety as a mirage is intriguing but underdeveloped; the cyber-templar’s personality lacks depth beyond the frantic resolve, and her voice feels indistinct despite the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments; the action of proving through refraction drives the story, though logical coherence wavers in the storm’s anthropomorphic response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the sky burial site is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like ozone and bone, enhancing the eerie tone; atmosphere supports the concept of illusory safety, though timeframe integration feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mix of triumph and dread, with potent imagery like lightning as a serpent; however, the ending lacks full satisfaction, and the theme of safety as illusion feels stated rather than deeply explored through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining cyberpunk and mythic elements, but metaphors like “lover’s embrace” feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but leans on explicit description over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
