<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scribe's uptight nature and transformation are evident, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; her shift to empathy lacks deeper internal conflict or backstory to fully ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the bulb's discovery and the scribe's change, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between analyzing adhesive and the broader narrative feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse and gravestone setting is vividly described with evocative imagery, enhancing the eerie, transformative tone; however, sensory details could be more varied beyond sight and sound to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on empathy and transformation with strong symbolism (bulb as healing light), but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a sharper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on Tesla's light as a metaphor for healing, some metaphors (e.g., "arms of steel") feel overused, and emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative integration, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
