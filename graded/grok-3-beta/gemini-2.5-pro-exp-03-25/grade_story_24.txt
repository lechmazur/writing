<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to stir cold hearts is clear and consistent, but her personality as a meandering bard feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or deeper personal stakes beyond the performance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the puppet show driving a subtle shift in the audience, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore and tavern setting create a vivid backdrop, with sensory details like stale beer enhancing atmosphere, but the bookstore itself is underutilized, missing deeper integration with the action or mood.</comment>
