<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of decoding ice crystals driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained, though the connection between telepathy and the method feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of decoding ice crystals is original, and the writing avoids overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "murky coffee") feel generic; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, though not deeply impactful; style is distinct but not unforgettable.</comment>
