<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's background as a poison taster and death wish are intriguing but underexplored; motivation to map energy flows feels clear but lacks depth in emotional grounding or backstory within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc with the impending collapse, but the method of interpreting psychic calls feels tenuously connected to the action of binding energy, causing minor coherence issues within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (sound, moisture), enhancing the atmosphere of serene upheaval and complementing the concept of hidden power; the ice sculpture ties well to the setting but less to the character’s direct motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and curiosity through the energy mapping and collapse, with effective imagery (shattering ice, roaring falls), but lacks deeper emotional resonance or subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to unresolved character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of psychic radio calls as a method is original, but the execution feels slightly forced and lacks nuanced emotional handling; sensory details are strong, yet the narrative leans on stated purpose over shown emotion, risking predictability in structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates many elements cohesively with creative intent, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact; style supports clarity but doesn’t elevate beyond functional storytelling.</comment>
