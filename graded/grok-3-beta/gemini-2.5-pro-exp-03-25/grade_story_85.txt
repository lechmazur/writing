<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the discovery of the schematic driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The petrified forest is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of lucid confusion and supporting Kaelen's quest, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its exploration of wisdom as devastating clarity, with strong symbolism in the schematic; however, the emotional impact is somewhat muted by a lack of personal stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of wisdom as destructive understanding is original, some metaphors (e.g., "sharp as shattered glass") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
