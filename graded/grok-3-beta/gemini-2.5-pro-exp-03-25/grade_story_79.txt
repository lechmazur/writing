<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brody's motivation to uncover the truth about Sarah's disappearance is clear and tied to his role as a sheriff, but his personality lacks depth beyond grief and resolve; his voice feels somewhat generic despite the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; tracing falling stars as a method is intriguing but underdeveloped, leaving the resolution vague and the pacing slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library and midday lull create a unique, evocative atmosphere that supports the tone of ghostly resolve; sensory details like dust motes and stagnant air are effective, though some connections to the object feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through imagery and subtext, with strong metaphors like the dirge; however, the ending lacks a fully satisfying impact, and the central conflict remains underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of quiet as a dirge is fresh, some descriptions (e.g., "crushing weight of quiet") verge on clich√©; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is muted by an unresolved arc.</comment>
