<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brother Malachi's unhinged zealotry is convincingly portrayed through his obsessive actions and beliefs, but his motivation lacks deeper nuance beyond surface-level fanaticism, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the uprooting act as a climax, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed buildup and a lingering, unresolved ending that lacks punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor in a jungle setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the eerie tone, though the connection between setting and object feels somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Malachi's desperate act, with effective symbolism in the uprooted fern, but the ending lacks a satisfying resolution, and the theme feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique premise, some descriptions (e.g., "raw nerve") feel generic, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
