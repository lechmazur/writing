<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's role as a professional scapegoat is intriguing and shapes his actions, but his motivation to decode symbols feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper emotional stakes or backstory to fully ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the data breach setup and symbol discovery, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the breach and Elias’s larger quest remains tenuous, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cloud city setting and timeframe are evocative, with sensory details like ozone enhancing atmosphere, but the setting’s integration with the character’s motivation and the washer feels more decorative than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers some subtext through the washer and abandoned identity, with decent imagery, but lacks a strong emotional impact or memorable uniqueness; the ending feels more functional than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a scapegoat in a futuristic city shows originality, some descriptions (e.g., “robustly delicate”) feel forced, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the washer and symbols, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the overall impact lacks a lingering depth or question.</comment>
