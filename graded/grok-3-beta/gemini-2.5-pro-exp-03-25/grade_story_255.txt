<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's nondescript nature and seer abilities are intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation for justice feels stated rather than deeply felt, lacking emotional depth in her reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the method of decryption via scent feels forced and disrupts logical coherence, making the resolution less convincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a strong, evocative atmosphere; sensory details like dust motes and moonlight are effective, though the setting's connection to the action feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its unique decryption method and theme of delayed justice, but the emotional impact is muted; imagery is strong, yet the ending lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The scent-based decryption is original, but the narrative leans on somewhat generic descriptors of emotion and atmosphere; metaphors like "ghosts of laughter" feel slightly overused, reducing freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about justice, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
