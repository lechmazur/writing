<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elara's sincere rebellion and desire to preserve tradition, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; Kael feels underdeveloped as a supporting figure with minimal distinct voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with theorizing driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a stronger emotional punch or consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively eerie in the haunted passage, with sensory details like cold air and dust motes enhancing mood; however, the setting's connection to the timeframe "between storms" feels underexplored and symbolic potential is not fully realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with the concept of architectural memory, and dialogue is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted; subtext exists but lacks depth, and the ending feels more functional than resonant or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of resonant frequencies in architecture is somewhat original, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of secret passages and haunted spaces without subversion; sensory details are adequate but not strikingly unique, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks a lingering impact or deeper question; style is clear but not distinctive, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
