<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Elara’s ruthlessness subtly mirrored in her precision, and her motivation to decode rock art is clear; however, Finn lacks depth beyond a quirky companion role, and their voices are not distinctly memorable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of distinguishing patterns driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between spontaneous conversations and resolution is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocatively described and enhances the mood of ancient burden, with sensory details like twilight and humming air adding immersion; however, the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about legacy and observation, with effective symbolism in the stones and comb, but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in linking ancient carvings to a slow catastrophe, but metaphors like the comb as a fragile tool feel slightly overextended, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
