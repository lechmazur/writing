<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo's phobia and stunt double background are well-integrated into his motivations and actions, particularly in confronting the pyramid's darkness, but his internal transformation lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice to elevate the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with unraveling the net driving a personal triumph, but pacing feels uneven—initial setup drags while the resolution feels abrupt, missing deeper cause-effect connections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pyramid setting and oppressive atmosphere effectively amplify Leo's fears with strong sensory details like dust and echoes, though the connection between the library and the net feels underexplored, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Leo's quiet triumph, with effective symbolism in the net, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending satisfies but doesn't resonate profoundly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique premise, some descriptions (e.g., "crushing dark") feel generic, and emotional depth is more stated than shown, missing the nuanced human texture expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the net and pyramid, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength, limiting lasting impact.</comment>
