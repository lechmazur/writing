<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Anya's sharp-witted nature and linguistic ineptitude are well-integrated into her identity as a dancer, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper internal conflict beyond the prophecy's pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between mimicking and prophecy resolution is intriguing but not fully fleshed out, leaving some logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The thought experiment chamber is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of ambivalence, but sensory details are sparse, and the bubble bath timeframe feels underutilized in enhancing mood or setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Anya's struggle with truth and denial, with strong symbolism in the patch and dance, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, missing a deeper punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining dance with unspoken truth, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptions (e.g., "terrifying freedom") feel slightly generic, lacking a fully unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the patch and prophecy, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting depth and lingering resonance.</comment>
