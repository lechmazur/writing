<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of eliciting resonance driving the story forward, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the new star and the urgency could be clearer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The utopia design studio and timeframe before a new star's birth create a compelling contrast, enhanced by sensory details like metallic air and silent vibrations, though the setting's connection to Elian's motivation could be more visceral.</comment>
