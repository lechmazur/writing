<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s fierce loyalty is evident, but her internal conflict and motivation to learn meditation feel underdeveloped and somewhat disconnected from her scout identity; her reactions lack depth beyond surface-level anxiety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the flickering city and coded broadcasts driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between personal and external conflicts remains vague, lacking full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city create a vivid, moody atmosphere of dread that complements the tone; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some tension through the broadcast’s menace, but emotional impact is limited by telling over showing; imagery like Ursa Minor is symbolic but not fully explored, and the ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it feels constrained by length rather than deliberately concise, with limited lingering impact.</comment>
