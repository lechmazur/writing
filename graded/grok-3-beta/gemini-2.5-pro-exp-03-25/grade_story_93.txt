<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s motivation to understand sacred geometry is clear, but her personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking distinctiveness beyond her crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with evasion driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed, and connections between elements like the radio signals and archive are not fully logical or cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive setting is evocative with strong sensory details like dust motes and humming servers, enhancing the desperate tone, though its connection to sacred geometry feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of sacred geometry and pirate radio signals offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "ghost in the machine") feel overused, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced showing over stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the archive and cards, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
