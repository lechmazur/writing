<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s stage fright as an exorcist is intriguing and shapes her internal conflict, but her motivation feels slightly overwrought and lacks specificity in how it drives her actions beyond general defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of submerging into psychic noise driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between fear and power are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly realized and enhances the atmosphere of improvisation and isolation, with sensory details like metallic clicks standing out; however, the connection between setting and wildflowers feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through Elara’s struggle, with strong symbolism in the wildflowers, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the theme of inherited lies feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining exorcism with a sci-fi setting, and metaphors like “defiant hush” are fresh, but some emotional descriptions lean toward telling rather than showing, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering sense of Elara’s quiet defiance, but overly dense prose occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
