<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to map the cave system in memory of Elara is clear and poignant, but his personality as a "hushed necromancer" lacks depth beyond the quiet resolve; his unique necromantic ability is intriguing but underexplored in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with mapping as a central action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a stronger climactic moment or resolution to elevate coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like fractured light and cool air, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone; however, the connection between the setting and Kael’s necromancy feels underdeveloped, missing a deeper atmospheric tie to his craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic emotional response through Kael’s grief and resolve, with effective imagery like "frozen data streams," but the ending feels more functional than impactful; subtext around loss is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a necromancer mapping caves via psychic imprints is original, the story leans on familiar grief-driven quest tropes without subversion; emotional handling shows nuance in actions over stated feelings, but some descriptors like "crushing silence" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, reflecting a moment of introspection; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound takeaway.</comment>
