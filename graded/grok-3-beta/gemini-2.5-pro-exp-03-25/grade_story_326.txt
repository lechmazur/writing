<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s motivation to defy his genetic tremor is clear and ties to his role as an illusionist, but his personality lacks depth beyond this struggle; his "sweetly fierce" attribute feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with mediation driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between Alistair’s personal stakes and the fairy conflict remains underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The underground fairy city and cosmic timeframe are imaginative, but sensory details are sparse, and the theme park setting feels underutilized in enhancing the atmosphere or supporting the mediation action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Alistair’s desperation, but literary devices like symbolism are surface-level, and the ending lacks a strong, satisfying punch despite a discernible central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of mediating via walkie-talkie is original, but the narrative leans on predictable savior tropes without subversion, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown through subtext or action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the walkie-talkie, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
