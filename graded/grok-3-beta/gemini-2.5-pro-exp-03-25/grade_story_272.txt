<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's use of reversed trails as a method is intriguing but lacks clarity in execution; the arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with pacing rushed at critical moments of discovery, leaving cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The diner setting during the late shift effectively conveys loneliness, enhanced by sensory details like fluorescent hums; however, the connection between the encrypted archive and diner feels tenuous, diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper regret through symbolism like the whistle, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending lacks punch, and tension feels underdeveloped despite a promising central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of sonic resonance and digital excavation is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors of regret and cynicism; metaphors like "tree of regret" feel overused, lacking fresh nuance.</comment>
