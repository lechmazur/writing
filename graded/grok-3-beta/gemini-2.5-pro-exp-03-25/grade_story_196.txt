<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s weariness and apathy are well-defined, shaping his internal conflict, but his sudden shift to defiance feels slightly unearned without deeper backstory or gradual build-up within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from stagnation to decision is clear, but pacing feels rushed at the transition to action, and the meteor shower method, while intriguing, lacks grounding in practical logic within the story’s scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is vividly described with sensory details like ozone and incense, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation, though the setting’s connection to the plain cloth bag feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through Kaelen’s resolve, with effective imagery like “heavens weep fire,” but lacks deeper subtext or a fully satisfying resolution within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of chasing meteor showers is original, some metaphors (e.g., “spark within him”) feel slightly overused, and emotional depth relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, and the lingering impact is modest due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
