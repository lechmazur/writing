<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, and their spectral nature shapes a distinct first-person voice, but their personality lacks depth beyond the mission, and reactions to the whistle and whale's call feel more functional than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The action of flinging the whistle drives the plot, and the whale's call as a method is intriguing, but the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and overpacked symbolism disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly described with strong sensory details (salt-laced stone, fog), enhancing the eerie tone and supporting the concept of forgotten wisdom, though the connection to the whistle feels somewhat forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood with layered symbolism (whistle as signal flare, whale's call as primal energy), but the emotional impact is diluted by overwritten prose; the ending is purposeful yet lacks punch, and the central conflict feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the perspective of a spectral guardian is unique, the language occasionally veers into purple prose with overly ornate phrasing; metaphors like "crushing tide of forgetting" feel slightly clich√©d, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style often hinders clarity with dense imagery; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
