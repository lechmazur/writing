<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Anya's no-nonsense yet empathic nature is clear, and her motivation to preserve humanity's echoes aligns with her role, but her personality lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice beyond the functional description of her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of mollifying driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are more implied than sharply defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is evocative and complements the tone of preserved traditions, with sensory details like dust and silence enhancing mood, though some sensory elements remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Anya's empathy and the concept of lingering humanity, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful yet not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., "sharp enough to cut glass") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on description than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but not wholly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, contained narrative.</comment>
