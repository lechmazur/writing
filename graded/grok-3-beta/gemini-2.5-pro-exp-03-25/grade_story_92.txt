<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to confront fear is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; reactions to the setting and objects feel surface-level, missing a distinct voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; pacing feels stagnant with little progression beyond internal reflection, and cause-effect relationships are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted mansion dining room and transition from day to night create a compelling atmosphere with strong sensory details like "loud silence," but the setting's connection to character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., night-blooming orchid) add some depth, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of fear rather than showing; the ending lacks a satisfying punch or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable haunted house tropes without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks a unique authorial stamp.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style is overly descriptive at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering thought or depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
