<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to prove mastery over nature is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the cyber-templar archetype; the "patiently frantic" attribute feels surface-level and underexplored in shaping his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of proving mastery driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sky burial site is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (wind, thunder, bone fragments), enhancing the atmosphere of euphoric agitation, though the setting's connection to the bridle feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension through Kaelen's struggle, with effective imagery (lightning, prism), but the ending lacks emotional resonance, and the theme of safety's mirage is more stated than shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a cyber-templar reflecting lightning is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "screaming colors") feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the prism and storm, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
