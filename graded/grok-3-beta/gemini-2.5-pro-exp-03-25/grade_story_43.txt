<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's wary nature and introverted monologue are distinct and shape the hesitant exploration, but motivation feels slightly abstract and lacks deeper personal stakes beyond a generic search for courage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; meandering feels aimless rather than purposeful, and pacing is uneven with heavy focus on description over progression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like fireflies and the cathedral, but brevity seems to limit depth rather than enhance it; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
