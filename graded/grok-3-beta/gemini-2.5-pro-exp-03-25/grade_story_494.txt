<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s arrogance and doubt are well-portrayed, with subtle cracks in his facade revealing inner conflict, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper insight into why he chooses to act beyond a fleeting memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the resolution; the action of authorizing the school’s legacy drives the story, but the pacing stumbles with abrupt emotional shifts that undermine coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is vividly described with sensory details like ink and moss, enhancing the mood of decay, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly tied to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kaelen’s internal struggle, with effective symbolism in the tapestry, but the dialogue feels slightly forced, and the theme of continuity lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “defiant flower”) feel generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly distinctive style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a faint lingering thought, though not a profound one, and the style is competent but not exceptional.</comment>
