<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s background as a vigilant orchardist shapes her meticulous nature effectively, and her motivation to overcome personal tragedy is clear, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped, lacking nuanced reactions beyond sardonic glee.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of demonstrating driving the climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between conspiracy and paper airplanes lacks full logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is vividly realized with sensory details like ozone and recycled paper, enhancing the atmosphere, though the setting’s connection to the conspiracy feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its conspiracy angle and uses striking imagery like the peacock’s tail, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of coded messages in flight patterns is original, but the execution relies on somewhat predictable conspiracy tropes without subversion, and emotional portrayal occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
