<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find liberation by helping ghosts is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "elegantly clumsy" trait, which feels superficially applied rather than integral to his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels uneven, with too much focus on internal musings over action, and the connection between staking out ghost tours and the resolution remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is evocative and ties to the theme of preservation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere, while moody, doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation or the central action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic tone and has subtext about transience, but the ending lacks impact, and the writing often tells rather than shows emotions, diminishing the overall craft and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the ghost trope feels predictable without subversion, and the language occasionally veers into generic descriptors, lacking a truly distinctive style or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, leaving the narrative without a lasting impression or deeper resonance.</comment>
