<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pragmatic nature and motivation to become a force of nature are clear, but her "lavishly humble" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the hammer’s use driving the resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the wasting sickness and the echo-driven cure lacks full logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village setting is vividly described and enhances the tone of dreadful hope, though sensory details are unevenly distributed, with some areas lacking immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and curiosity through Elara’s unsettling power, with some effective imagery, but the ending feels more functional than resonant, and subtext is present but not fully developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of manufactured miracles offers originality, some descriptions (e.g., “memory’s corridors”) feel overly ornate and generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the hammer and echo, but the style occasionally overreaches with florid language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
