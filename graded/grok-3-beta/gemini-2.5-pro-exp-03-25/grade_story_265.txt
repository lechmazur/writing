<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Deputy Miller's impassive nature and personal yet detached motivation are intriguing, but his inner drive to witness grace feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution, making his actions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the oil change timeframe and the central action lacks stronger causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lush orchard in an abandoned cathedral is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of cautious bravery and supporting the concept of uncharted echoes; however, the timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict is understated, and the theme of grace feels more implied than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining elements like the secret language of bees and the cathedral orchard, but some metaphors (e.g., apple as grace) lean toward clich√©, and emotional nuance is present but not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of quiet wonder, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
