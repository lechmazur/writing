<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s flighty nature contrasts well with her precise cartography skills, and her motivation to leave a legacy is clear, but her internal conflict lacks deeper exploration within the word limit, making her reactions feel slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action of linearizing drives the plot, and the method fits logically, but the pacing feels rushed at times, and the arc, while present, lacks a fully satisfying resolution due to abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret society hall is vividly described with a strangely normal atmosphere that enhances the tone of serene anger; sensory details like the marble floors and grease scent are effective, though some connections between setting and object feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Elara’s defiance and connection to past rebels, with strong imagery like the painted cosmos, but the ending feels slightly underwhelming, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with the hidden astronomical data, some metaphors (e.g., “serene anger”) feel overused, and emotional depth is stated more than shown, hinting at a lack of nuanced human resonance; still, it avoids major clichés.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the grease patch and hidden details, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
