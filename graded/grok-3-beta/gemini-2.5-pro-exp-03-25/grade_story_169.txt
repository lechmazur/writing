<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's role as a soul-broker real estate agent is intriguing, and his motivation to learn forgotten songs adds depth, but his personality lacks distinctiveness beyond grandiose modesty, and his voice feels somewhat generic despite the unique premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a clear arc, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between reading reversed labels and the soul transition lacks stronger causal grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating tea platform and static air create a surreal, evocative atmosphere that complements the tone of grandiose modesty, with sensory details like jasmine and ozone enhancing immersion, though the setting's connection to the action feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through themes of empathy and loss, with effective imagery like the dusty bottle, but the conflict is understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger lingering impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of forgotten songs and soul-brokering offers originality, but the narrative occasionally leans on overly ornate language and predictable emotional beats, missing nuanced human complexity in Alistair's reasoning and reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the contemplative tone, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaboration, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
