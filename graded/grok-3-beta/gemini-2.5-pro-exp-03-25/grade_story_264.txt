<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's unruliness is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation to disarm cynicism is clear but lacks depth in execution. Her hauntingly cheerful attribute is intriguing but feels surface-level in impact on her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of impressing driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax. Logical flow is maintained, though the ending lacks a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station setting enhances the celestial theme effectively, and sensory details like the projectorâ€™s hum add immersion. However, the atmosphere could better reflect the infinite caution tone consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes awe and wonder, with strong imagery in the projected light, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by underdeveloped character reactions. Subtext is present but not fully layered; dialogue feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of captured meteor echoes is original, some descriptions (e.g., "impossible blues and greens") verge on generic. Emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative lacks a truly unique stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the cracked lens and projector hum, but the brief length slightly undermines depth. It leaves a lingering sense of wonder, though not profoundly thought-provoking.</comment>
