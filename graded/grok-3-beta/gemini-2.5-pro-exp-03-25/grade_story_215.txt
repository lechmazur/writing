<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's rattled state and inward social nature are present but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack depth, and reactions to the postcard feel surface-level rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically through puzzles to a hidden room, with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lessons create an intriguing contrast, with sensory details like ozone and humming dampeners enhancing atmosphere, though the setting's connection to character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild dread and curiosity, with some subtext about hubris, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper emotional punch or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining occult and science, but sensory details are occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and while it leaves a question about hubris, the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
