<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alaric’s motivation to solve the labyrinth is clear and ties to his past betrayal, but his "earnestly frivolous" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes his personality beyond the confetti method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the confetti-coded proposals as a method feel forced and lack logical grounding in driving the labyrinth’s response, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of mystery, complemented by sensory details like tremors and lantern glow, though the setting’s connection to the weddings feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity through Alaric’s quest and uses effective imagery (kaleidoscope, lanterns), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext or a fully satisfying resolution within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like confetti proposals and a labyrinth’s consciousness, with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate phrasing and predictable quest tropes slightly diminish authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about the labyrinth’s nature, but overly complex language at times hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
