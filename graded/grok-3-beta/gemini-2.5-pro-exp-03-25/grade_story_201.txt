<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's impulsiveness and whimsical nature are evident in her actions, but her deeper motivation feels underdeveloped; the emotional inheritance is stated rather than deeply explored through her distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the tackle driving a climactic moment, but pacing feels rushed at the confrontation, and the shooting star method lacks clear causal impact on the discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the restless harmony tone and supporting Elara's urgency, though the connection between setting and music sheet feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the inherited grief, and imagery like shooting stars as witnesses is striking, but the conflict resolution feels abrupt, and subtext is underdeveloped for a deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality, some descriptions (e.g., "wild counterpoint") feel formulaic, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a fully lingering impact.</comment>
