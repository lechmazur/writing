<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and tied to the past as a child star, but the portrayal of "authentically odd" feels slightly exaggerated and lacks subtle depth; reactions to the artifact are intriguing but not fully explored in personal terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between the map and the glass, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between sonic waves and psychic energy are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone; sensory details like humming machinery are effective, though the atmosphere could better reflect the timeframe "after the last secret is revealed."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and tension through the concept of wild magic, with strong imagery, but the ending feels more provocative than satisfying; dialogue is minimal but fitting, though subtext is present yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining psychic energy with etched glass, but some descriptors (e.g., "beautiful, terrible enlightenment") verge on clich√©; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of unease, but the brief length slightly hampers depth; style supports the narrative, though clarity is occasionally muddled by dense phrasing.</comment>
