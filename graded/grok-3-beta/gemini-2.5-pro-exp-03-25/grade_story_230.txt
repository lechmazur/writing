<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's compassion as a mage is hinted at but underdeveloped; her motivation to uncover a key is clear but lacks depth in emotional stakes or backstory, making her actions feel somewhat mechanical despite alignment with her traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the banishing action driving the story forward logically, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; coherence is maintained, but the connection between beginning and end could be stronger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The intelligence center setting and submarine hull are vividly described and enhance the action, with a tone of hopeful brutality complementing the concept; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about family history, with some effective imagery (rivets as scars), but lacks emotional depth or subtext; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and the central conflict feels underexplored within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of magical frequency is intriguing, the story leans on familiar tropes of hidden family secrets without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but sensory details feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a choice, with only a faint lingering impact.</comment>
