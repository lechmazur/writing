<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jedediah’s motivation to learn healing traditions is clear and ties to his grandmother’s legacy, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond the “gracefully awkward” trait, which is mentioned but not deeply explored in action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the coded letter driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between nightmares and the ossuary’s history lacks clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient ossuary turned restaurant is a striking setting that enhances the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, and the bike rides as a timeframe feel underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some intrigue with the coded letter and ossuary’s secrets, and imagery like “polished femurs” is memorable, but the ending feels abrupt, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the ossuary-restaurant concept is original, the narrative leans on predictable mystery tropes without subversion, and some phrases like “harsh tenderness” feel forced rather than organic to the style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a fully resonant lingering impact.</comment>
