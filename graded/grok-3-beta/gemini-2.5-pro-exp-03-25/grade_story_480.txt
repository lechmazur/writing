<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kai's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing but underdeveloped; their motivation to seek raw experience feels surface-level and lacks depth in execution, with actions only loosely tied to this unique profession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reigniting curiosity driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between digital exorcism and physical exploration remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall settings are vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the tone of indifferent enthusiasm, though the link between setting and Kai's digital background feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild sense of curiosity and uses imagery effectively, but lacks a strong emotional impact or deeper subtext; the ending feels more observational than purposeful or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, and the writing avoids overt clich√©s, but some descriptions (e.g., "urban fabric") feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a moderate level of cohesion with creative use of elements like the grocery receipt, but the style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
