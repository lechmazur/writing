<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Elias's transition from city planner to doomsday prepper, but his motivations feel surface-level and lack deeper emotional grounding; the "rarely authentic" attribute is mentioned but not fully explored in his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the tremor and the distant handshake feels forced and disrupts coherence; pacing is uneven, with rushed conclusions undermining the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere of isolation, with sensory details like dust motes adding immersion; however, the timeframe of the handshake feels disconnected from the setting, weakening overall impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the ink blotter and broken constellations, but the emotional resonance is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying due to unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable doomsday prepper tropes without subversion; metaphors like "smudged uncertainties" feel generic, and emotional handling lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings rather than subtext, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
