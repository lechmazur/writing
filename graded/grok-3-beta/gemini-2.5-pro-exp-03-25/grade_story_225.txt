<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to track migratory butterflies as a form of resistance is intriguing, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single obsession; her reactions and voice feel somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of infecting the butterflies driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of battered marvel, though the connection between setting and butterflies feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet wonder and protective resolve, with effective imagery like “metallic dew,” but lacks deeper subtext or a fully satisfying resolution; the central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of tracking butterflies in a submarine is original, some metaphors like “stained glass” feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly impactful one.</comment>
