<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Jax's pursuit of waterfalls tied to Elara's memory, but his irate nature feels somewhat one-dimensional, lacking deeper nuance or growth within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the memorializing action driving emotional stakes, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between jogging and the larger goal of finding waterfalls remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly described with sensory details like cracked ferrocrete and biting wind, enhancing the desolate mood, but its connection to the chopstick and waterfalls feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Jax's longing and frustration, with decent use of symbolism (chopstick as anchor), but the ending lacks a strong punch, and the theme of revolt feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of tea leaf patterns offers a unique angle, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes of loss and gritty survival without significant subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it leaves a lingering sadness but lacks deeper resonance or innovation.</comment>
