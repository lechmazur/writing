<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's detachment as a brewer is clear, but his deeper personality and emotional nuance remain underdeveloped; motivation feels surface-level and lacks personal stakes beyond the generic resistance narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with brewing as a central action driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between brewing and systemic disruption are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus tent and transition from analog to digital create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by evocative imagery like "ghostly membrane"; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some thought on freedom and surveillance, with decent use of symbolism (photo frame as memory), but lacks emotional depth and a truly satisfying ending; conflict is present but resolution feels underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining brewing with resistance, some metaphors ("ghostly membrane") feel slightly overused, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
