<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's role as a "Social Media Exorcist" is intriguing, but her motivation feels surface-level, driven by curiosity without deeper emotional stakes or backstory. Her "quietly loud" attribute is mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the action of "reignite" feels abstract and lacks concrete stakes. Pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions between setup and climax, though coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting is evocatively described with moonlight and industrial decay, enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details like the low hum are effective, but the timeframe ("after the final chord") feels tacked on and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has a unique concept and some subtext about digital-human boundaries, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing emotions and conflict. Imagery is strong, yet the ending feels predictable, lacking a deeper emotional or intellectual punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, and metaphors like "digital shadows" are fresh, but some descriptions (e.g., "indifferent enthusiasm") feel forced. Emotional resonance is stated rather than evoked, and the tone occasionally shifts unnaturally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style sometimes obscures clarity with overly ornate language. It leaves a lingering idea of digital liminality, though the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
