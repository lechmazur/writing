<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to decode star maps is clear, but her personality as a "bright-eyed apprentice" feels underdeveloped; her actions are driven by determination, yet lack depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with "overcharge" driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links between notes and holographic projection are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement enhances the eerie tone and complements Aria's mission; sensory details like damp stone walls are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild hope through Aria's discovery, with some symbolism in the phone booth key, but subtext is shallow, and the ending feels more functional than deeply satisfying; conflict resolution is abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of star maps in a post-apocalyptic world is intriguing, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors like "spectral energy" feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; creative thinking is present, yet the style lacks the polish for immediate impact or lingering resonance.</comment>
