<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Aria's quest to solve her mentor's disappearance, but her "eagerly jaded" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance; her actions align with the investigation but her distinct voice is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure shows a clear arc within the word limit, with auditions driving the investigation forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (e.g., decoding coordinates) are abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" setting is evocative and ties to the tone of "graceless beauty," but sensory details are sparse beyond scuffed floors and faded curtains, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere and immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has potential for emotional impact with themes of loss and resilience, but overreliance on telling (e.g., "transforming grief into understanding") rather than showing through action or subtext diminishes impact; ending feels purposeful but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of dance as investigation is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable mystery tropes without subversion; metaphors like the glove "pulsing with anticipation" feel generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
