<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Captain Elena Reyes’ motivation to preserve human narratives is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond her mission; the spiritually secular attribute feels underexplored in shaping her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while the concept of unity drives the narrative, the pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect relationships are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of loss, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has subtext about unity and loss, with some effective symbolism (coffee stains, coat button), but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of reading futures in coffee stains is unique, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of a lone guardian saving humanity, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with its elements, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
