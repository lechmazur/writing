<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Helena's motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear and consistent, but her glamorous persona feels somewhat superficial and underexplored in shaping her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the mathematician's request and the broader narrative arc lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mortuary setting enhances the mood effectively with sensory details like the brass tape's gleam, though the social network archive feels disconnected and underutilized in building atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Helena's reverence, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some descriptors (e.g., "sacred inheritance") feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown; originality is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the brass tape, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
