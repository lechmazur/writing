<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode rock art is clear, but the "ruthless flower arranger" trait feels underexplored in shaping personality beyond a surface analogy to methodology; voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution within word limit, driven by the action to "distinguish," though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; spontaneous road trip conversations as a method integrate logically but lack depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stone circle setting and timeframe (pause between singer’s verses) are evocatively paired, enhancing mystery; sensory details like distant chords are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized in atmosphere-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intellectual curiosity but lacks deep emotional resonance; imagery and symbolism (stone circle as narrative) are present but not striking; ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to limited conflict depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clichés but lacks a truly unique voice; metaphors like stone breathing are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, missing deeper subtext or surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative; style supports clarity but lacks flair; brief length feels deliberate, though depth is sacrificed; leaves a lingering thought but not a profound one.</comment>
