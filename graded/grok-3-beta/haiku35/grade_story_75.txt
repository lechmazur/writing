<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to preserve extinct crafts is clear and aligns with her role as a guarded minstrel, but her personality lacks depth beyond the surface trait of being skeptically credulous; her reactions and voice feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the decryption of wedding vows driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit, and the connection between beginning and end is more implied than fully realized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vividly described with evocative details like crystalline circuits and light patterns, enhancing the atmosphere of surveillance and rebellion, though sensory immersion could be deeper with varied senses beyond sight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about cultural preservation and resistance, with strong symbolism in the wedding vows as weaving instructions, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by a lack of nuanced 'showing' over 'telling' in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of coded vows and nano-forest is original, some descriptions (e.g., "controlled burn") feel slightly clich√©d, and emotional portrayal occasionally lacks human nuance, leaning toward stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
