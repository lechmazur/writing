<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elenaâ€™s brazenness as a raider is evident, but her impulsively thoughtful nature feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action to warn, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between discoveries and outcomes are underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some intellectual curiosity, with decent use of metaphor (fractured glass as narrative), but lacks emotional depth and a truly satisfying ending; conflict resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the story leans on predictable tropes of suppressed genius and institutional betrayal without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
