<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of delayed justice is clear, but the seer’s nondescript nature feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or personal depth beyond analytical prowess.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between untangling the conspiracy and the rain’s scent is tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with petrichor and the decaying control tower enhancing mood; sensory details are evocative, though the surprise party hush feels underexplored in relation to setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (USB as time capsule) and subtext about systemic oppression; however, emotional resonance is limited by a lack of personal stakes for the seer, and the ending feels more intellectual than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in linking data decryption to systemic wounds, but metaphors like “labyrinth of connections” feel overused; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the USB drive and control tower, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
