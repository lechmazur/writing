<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a pickpocket seeking transformation is intriguing but underdeveloped; his shift from thief to introspective revolutionary feels abrupt and lacks depth in internal conflict or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with transformation driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the dummy's role as a catalyst is somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with a fitting eerie atmosphere that enhances the tone of transformation; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on personal reinvention with some effective symbolism (lighthouse as crucible), but dialogue from the dummy feels unnatural, and the theme, while present, lacks nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a speaking dummy offers originality, the execution leans on predictable supernatural tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like transformation and poetry, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped character depth; it leaves a lingering idea, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
