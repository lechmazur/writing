<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's motivation to silence regret is clear, but his internal struggle lacks depth beyond surface-level conflict; his personality feels archetypal rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the impossible choice drives the narrative, yet cause-effect links are somewhat predictable and lack nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef create a vivid, turbulent atmosphere that mirrors Aldric's emotions; sensory details are effective but occasionally overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the central conflict, but literary devices like mirrored reflections feel heavy-handed; dialogue is purposeful yet lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar knightly tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style borders on overwrought; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
