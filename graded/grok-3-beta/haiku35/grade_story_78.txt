<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena's portrayal as a late-blooming hero with soft militancy is intriguing, and her motivation to understand cosmic balance is unique, but her inner conflict and emotional depth lack specificity; her reactions feel somewhat predictable for the genre.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the approaching figure providing tension, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than narrative, lacking a stronger causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is vividly realized and complements the tone of reluctant awe, enhancing Elena's motivation; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through smell or sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet resilience and uses symbolism effectively (rooftop as regeneration), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of specific personal stakes; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a fresh take on post-apocalyptic survival, some descriptions (e.g., "landscape of perpetual uncertainty") feel generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans on ornate phrasing that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of resilience, though not powerfully so.</comment>
