<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mei Lin's motivation to resist through cryptic messages is clear, and her "reliably unreliable" trait is intriguing, but her personality lacks depth beyond the resistance role; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between reclaiming the future and the specific action of encoding messages lacks tighter causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope studio and timeframe between curfew and sunrise create a vivid, tense atmosphere that supports the story's mood; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through its theme of cultural preservation, with effective symbolism in the chipped tile, but the dialogue is minimal and lacks impact; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a fortune cookie writer as resistance is original, some metaphors (e.g., "kaleidoscope studio's fractured light") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the chipped tile, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
