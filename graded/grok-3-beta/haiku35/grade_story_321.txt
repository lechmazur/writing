<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maria's motivation to confront familial silence is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond controlled fury; her voice in dialogue is weighty yet underdeveloped due to brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit, with a strong setup but an abrupt ending lacking resolution; pacing is uneven, with heavy focus on internal conflict over action, causing coherence to waver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen setting effectively mirrors the simmering tension, and sensory details like copper pots enhance mood; however, the timeframe's integration feels abstract and underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the ribbon and hourglass evokes thought, and subtext around forgiveness adds depth; yet, emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the ribbon metaphor is fresh, the narrative leans on familiar family betrayal tropes without subversion; language occasionally veers into ornate territory, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style's complexity sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering question about reconciliation, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
