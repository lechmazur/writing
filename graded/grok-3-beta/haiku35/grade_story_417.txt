<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleanor’s unhinged zealotry is evident, but her motivations lack depth beyond obsession; Marcus feels underdeveloped, a mere observer without distinct voice or agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the concept of cultural transplantation drives the narrative, but pacing is uneven, with rushed escalation and an abrupt ending lacking resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor in the jungle is striking and enhances the absurdity, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion; atmosphere supports Eleanor’s mania but inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story prompts thought on cultural adaptability, with some symbolism (bottle cap), but emotional impact is muted; dialogue feels stilted, and the ending lacks punch or lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise is original, execution relies on predictable academic-obsession tropes without subversion; sensory details are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking fresh style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
