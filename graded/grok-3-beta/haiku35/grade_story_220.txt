<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the chance meeting driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth and wounded autumn season create a vivid, moody atmosphere that enhances the mystery, with strong sensory details like metallic clangs and rust-streaked walls; however, the setting’s connection to character motivation could be deeper.</comment>
