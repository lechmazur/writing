<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena’s solitary nature and artistic passion are evident, but her motivation lacks depth beyond the abstract goal of emotional translation; her "fiercely gentle" attribute feels underexplored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the act of painting as resuscitation drives the story, but pacing is uneven with an abrupt shift to cosmic revelation at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly realized with sensory details and enhances the intimate, otherworldly tone; it strongly supports Elena’s motivation, though some connections to terrestrial separation feel vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through imagery and subtext of cosmic connection, with a satisfying ending; however, the central conflict is more conceptual than tangible, and emotional depth is sometimes told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its cosmic-artistic premise, with fresh metaphors, but occasionally leans on ornate language and abstract emotion that borders on purple prose, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of wonder; however, the style’s complexity sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
