<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elena's daydreaming and scholarly nature are present, but her motivations feel somewhat abstract and not fully grounded in personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while thereâ€™s a sense of arc, the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on abstract ideas over concrete action within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative with the skating rink and submerged palace, but sensory details are sparse, and the cursed lake setting feels underutilized, not fully enhancing the action or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic imagery, but emotional resonance is limited by over-telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying, lacking a sharp central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly ornate language and generic metaphors; while the concept is intriguing, the execution feels formulaic at times, lacking nuanced emotional depth and relying on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative intent but lacks cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style leans toward complexity over clarity, diminishing the lingering impact.</comment>
