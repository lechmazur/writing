<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to chronicle elder wisdom is clear, but Aria's personality as a freelancer of life experiences feels underdeveloped and lacks distinct voice or depth in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of outwitting forgetting is conceptually intriguing but remains abstract without concrete progression or conflict.</comment>
