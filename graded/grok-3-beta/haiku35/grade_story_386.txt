<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to resurrect her civilization is clear and aligns with her identity as a time refugee, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her "trustworthy strangeness" feels mentioned rather than shown through distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the catapult launch as a climax, but the pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between the tablecloth and the action, while creative, lacks sufficient grounding in logical cause and effect within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is evocative and enhances the mood of isolation and defiance, with strong sensory imagery like the "borrowed dawn," though the integration of the timeframe "hush of a line that never moves" feels vague and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of longing and hope through Elara's mission, with effective symbolism in the tablecloth, but the emotional depth is somewhat surface-level, relying on stated purpose rather than nuanced "showing" of feelings; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a time refugee and coded tablecloth is original, some metaphors (e.g., "borrowed dawn") feel slightly overused, and the narrative occasionally leans on formal, ornate language that borders on purple prose, diminishing authenticity; emotional resonance is present but not deeply nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the lighthouse and tablecloth, but the style sometimes overcomplicates clarity; the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, though it leaves a lingering sense of potential recovery.</comment>
