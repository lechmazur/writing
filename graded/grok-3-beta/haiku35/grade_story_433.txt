<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena’s hardheadedness and brokenness are evident, but her motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks specificity in how it drives her actions beyond obsession. Her voice is not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the revelation. The struggle drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery and snow days create a cohesive, evocative atmosphere that enhances the mood of introspection. Sensory details like snow and glass sculptures are effective, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on internal power and humanity, with strong use of metaphor (snow as witness, art as transformation). However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a sharper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the internal journey trope feels familiar without significant subversion. Metaphors are fresh but not striking, and emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered. Writing style is clear but not uniquely memorable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate brevity, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative. It leaves a lingering thought about power, but the style occasionally leans toward over-description, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
