<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's portrayal as a repressed poet is clear, and his motivation to pen a cosmic verse is consistent, but his internal conflict lacks deeper nuance or specificity beyond general fear of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the spontaneous exploration driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like vines and silence, enhancing the mood of decay and introspection, though the timeframe's "pin-drop silence" feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood through imagery and symbolism (perfume bottle as memory), but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by a lack of specificity in Marcus's transformation; the theme of impermanence is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "ghostly tendrils") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but the style occasionally leans toward overwriting, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
