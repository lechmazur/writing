<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a focus on maritime justice, but Marcus lacks depth or distinct voice; his dry wit is mentioned but not shown through dialogue or action, rendering the trait superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the crossing of names leading to a climactic moment, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between dance and justice is underdeveloped, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively haunting with vivid imagery of the lighthouse and sea, enhancing the tone of vengeance, though sensory details are somewhat repetitive and lack variety beyond sight and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with maritime justice, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing relies on generic descriptors like "uncompromising resolve" and overused maritime tropes without subversion; lacks fresh metaphors and shows little individual style, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
