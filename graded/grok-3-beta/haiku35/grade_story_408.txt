<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thomas's conscientious objection is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation is consistent but not compellingly explored through action or dialogue, resulting in a somewhat flat character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; mapping migration routes drives the narrative but feels more conceptual than active, with pacing slowed by excessive introspection over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine create a vivid atmosphere with strong sensory detail, enhancing the tone of coy malevolence, though the setting's connection to character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild reflection on peace versus war, with decent use of symbolism (rusty nail, orchard), but lacks emotional depth or a satisfying ending; conflict is present but too abstract to resonate strongly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery (storm-battered branches) is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable themes of war and peace without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but they often overshadow a distinct narrative voice; length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and the impact is muted despite some creative integration.</comment>
