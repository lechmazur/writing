<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's nostalgic tailor persona is intriguing, but his motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional depth; his voice, while distinct, doesn't fully convey the weight of his mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the concept of parallel lives driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between stitching and reality transformation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck and stormy atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like rain and lightning, enhancing the mood of hopeful desperation; however, the setting's connection to the mirror feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about reality transformation and uses strong imagery (mirror rippling like mercury), but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling of Marcus's hope rather than showing nuanced reactions; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of stitching realities is original, some metaphors (e.g., "weavers of potential") feel generic, and emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than subtext; the style shows individuality but occasionally slips into ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the mirror and parallel lives, leaving a lingering question about reality's nature, but overly complex language sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
