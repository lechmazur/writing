<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's quest tied to loss, but his personality lacks depth beyond the woodsman archetype; the hairbrush connection feels symbolic yet underexplored in shaping his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between mapping railways and personal loss is intriguing yet not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is vividly described with sensory details and complements the tone of despairing cheer; the setting enhances the action, though the hospital timeframe integration feels slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through loss and discovery, with strong symbolism in the hairbrush and railways; however, the ending feels more conceptual than emotionally satisfying, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining electromagnetic imagery with personal grief, but some metaphors (e.g., "veins beneath translucent skin") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of connection and loss; however, style occasionally leans toward ornate, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
