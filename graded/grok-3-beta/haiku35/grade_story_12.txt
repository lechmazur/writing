<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elena's aloofness and motivation to learn the language of the soul are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice, leaving her personality somewhat flat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented with no clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the concept of memory ties drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed and lacks coherent progression from beginning to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is vividly described and contrasts well with the cracked tile, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting's connection to character motivation feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with strong imagery and subtext around memory, but the lack of clear conflict or emotional resonance, combined with an unsatisfying ending, diminishes overall craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors (e.g., fractures as memories) and a reliance on abstract language over concrete emotion; the narrative lacks a fresh perspective and feels somewhat formulaic despite creative elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; while some elements are integrated thoughtfully, the style leans toward overwrought prose, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
