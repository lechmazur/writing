<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn universal patterns is clear and drives Elena's actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this obsession; reactions to the coathanger feel symbolic yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and intriguing middle, but the resolution feels incomplete; pacing is managed well within word limit, though coherence suffers from vague cause-effect in debris communication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the orbital debris tracking station is vividly realized and enhances the action; sensory details like rustling postcards add atmosphere, though some connections between setting and tone feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes wonder through the debris's dance and uses symbolism effectively with the coathanger; however, emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character exploration, and the ending lacks full impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in the concept of debris communication, but metaphors like "branches of redemption" feel overused and slightly ornate; emotional nuance is present but not deeply felt, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of wonder; however, style occasionally overreaches with complexity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
