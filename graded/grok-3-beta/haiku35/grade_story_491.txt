<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Serene Fisher's motivation to resurrect extinct plants is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond obsession; the torn wristband as a symbol feels underexplored in revealing her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy exposition; connections between actions and outcomes are logical but lack tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is evocative and supports the theme of preservation, with sensory details like humidity noted; however, the lullaby's hush feels tacked on and underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of botanical illusion is somewhat original, the narrative relies on predictable themes of loss and revival without subversion; language is ornate at times, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it leaves a faint lingering thought of hope, yet lacks the depth for a prestigious publication.</comment>
