<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the transformation action lacks concrete grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with the crystal fortress and lunar imagery, enhancing the mystical tone, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity with layered symbolism and a satisfying ending, but emotional resonance is limited by a lack of nuanced 'showing' over 'telling' in key emotional shifts.</comment>
