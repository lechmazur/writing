<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape perceptual limitations is clear and drives Aldric's actions, but his "deeply superficial" attribute feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping his personality or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within the word limit with a contemplative resolution, but pacing is uneven, with overly dense exposition slowing the middle, and the connection between action and concept feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating library setting is vividly realized and enhances the mystical tone, effectively supporting the concept of consistent miracles, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the seashell and library, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by a tendency to "tell" rather than "show" Aldric's transformation; subtext is present but not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of perceptual miracles is intriguing, the narrative leans on abstract language that borders on purple prose, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown, lacking the raw specificity of human experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the lingering impact is muted by abstract delivery.</comment>
