<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a living statue is unique, the narrative leans on steampunk tropes without subversion; metaphors like calligraphy feel forced, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering question, yet feels constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
