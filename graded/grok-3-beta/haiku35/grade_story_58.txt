<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's fierce loyalty and role as a scout are evident, but her motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes; her voice is distinct but underdeveloped due to limited dialogue and internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of radicalizing driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than concrete, leaving some coherence gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a compelling atmosphere of sanctified dread that supports the story's tone; sensory details are present but could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its subversive theme of revolution via comedy, with effective symbolism (moth, journal), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of personal stakes; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of coded comedy is original, some metaphors (e.g., "internal storms") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated ideas than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped character depth; it leaves a lingering thought about subtle revolution, though clarity is occasionally hindered by abstract language.</comment>
