<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Helena's cunning and morally ambiguous nature are evident, but her motivation feels somewhat vague and lacks depth; her actions align with her traits, yet her distinct voice is underdeveloped within the limited dialogue and third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc and logical flow within the word limit, with decoding driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the grocery store opening lacks strong connection to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower and grocery store settings are intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Helena's motivation or the story's tone of gentle chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts some intellectual curiosity with its historical puzzle, and imagery like "delicate origami" is effective, but emotional resonance is minimal, and the ending feels more expository than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of decoding vintage seed packets is original, and metaphors are mostly fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable researcher tropes, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking deeper human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like seed packets, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a strong lingering impact.</comment>
