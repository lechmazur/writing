<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's subdued vigilante nature and motivation to master an ancient art are intriguing but underdeveloped; his personality lacks depth beyond surface traits, and his voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; while the concept of war's price shapes the narrative, the pacing feels uneven, and the connection between beginning and end is vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and tone of screaming silence create a compelling atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the mirror and bead feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its focus on war's narratives, with strong symbolism in the mirror, but the emotional impact is muted, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch; subtext is present but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the mirror distortions offer an original angle, the story leans on predictable war-as-narrative tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often overextended, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with ornate language; the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice, and the lingering impact is limited.</comment>
