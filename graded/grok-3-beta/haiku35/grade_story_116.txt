<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ezra's dismay is evident, but his minstrel identity feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice or influence on his actions; motivation to map the endless night is clear but not deeply explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the concept of boundaries shapes the narrative, though cause-effect links between memory fragments and mapping are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting of the sky-lounge is vividly realized and enhances the mood of liminality; sensory details are evocative, though garden secrets in the timeframe feel underexplored in connection to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery with the broken watch band and polaroids; subtext about time and perception is compelling, though emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids clich√©s and offers a unique take on mapping night, but some metaphors (e.g., "velvet darkness pulsing") border on overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully shown through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements; style supports the narrative, though depth is constrained by length; leaves a lingering thought about perception, but impact is not fully profound.</comment>
