<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as a professional cuddler shapes her motivation to heal through touch, but her deeper prejudice and personal growth remain underdeveloped, lacking specific backstory or emotional depth to make her truly distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the ticket punch and the overarching narrative feels forced; pacing is uneven, with the climax rushed and lacking clear cause-effect resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is evocative and supports the tone of decay, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Mayaâ€™s motivation or the concept of unspoken rules beyond surface-level mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of connection and vulnerability, with some effective symbolism via the ticket punch, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels more cryptic than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler in a spaceport is unique, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like "technological cathedral" feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
