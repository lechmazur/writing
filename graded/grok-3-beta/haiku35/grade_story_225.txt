<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Helena's motivation as a wayward apothecary is clear, driven by an unconventional love for butterflies, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of the misunderstood genius. Her actions align with her motivation, yet her voice and reactions feel somewhat generic, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of tracking butterflies driving the narrative forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end, while present, lacks a stronger emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details like creaking decks and copper pipes, enhancing the atmosphere of a battered marvel. However, the connection between the setting and the butterfly tracking feels somewhat tenuous, missing deeper integration with the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about butterfly migration but lacks a strong emotional impact or memorable subtext. Imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels more functional than satisfying. Conflict is introduced but resolved too neatly within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of tracking butterflies via morse code is original, the execution relies on predictable tropes of the ostracized scientist. Sensory details are adequate but not vivid, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic to the narrative.
