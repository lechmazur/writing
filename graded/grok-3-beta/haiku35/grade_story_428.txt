<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear as a city planner turned doomsday prepper, but lacks depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice; transformation feels stated rather than shown through specific, revealing actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect relationships are more implied than concretely developed, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of impending collapse is effectively tied to the mountain cabin and temple imagery, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story has some thematic depth with collapse and adaptation, and symbolism of the ink blotter is notable, but emotional impact is muted due to reliance on telling over showing; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows potential for originality, the execution leans on predictable prepper tropes without subversion; metaphors like "cracked leather" feel generic, and emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
