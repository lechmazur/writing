<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between musical notes and the manuscript reveal lacks sufficient buildup or logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with sensory details like musty air and ethereal notes, enhancing the haunted mansion cellar setting; however, the timeframe of winterâ€™s end feels underutilized in mood or symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through the theme of self-expression as hidden melody, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and dialogue is minimal, limiting character voice impact.</comment>
