<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation to connect past and present is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond her role as a historical investigator; her reactions to the sewing box and poltergeist activity feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with cleaning driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed revelations at the end disrupt coherence; cause and effect are logical but lack tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Roman villa is vividly rendered and enhances the cleaning action, with a tone of reverence fitting the concept; sensory details are present but not consistently evocative, missing deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through human connection across time, with some effective symbolism in the sewing box, but lacks a strong central conflict; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality in blending technology and spirituality, some descriptions feel generic, and emotional handling is more stated than shown; metaphors are occasionally fresh but not consistently unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought of connection, though not powerfully so, within the brief length.</comment>
