<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but the arc feels incomplete, with an overemphasis on setup and little resolution; pacing is uneven, lingering too long on introspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting on the variable star observation deck is evocative and ties to the tone of uncertainty, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolism around the nail, but emotional resonance is shallow due to excessive telling over showing; the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic metaphors and a predictable revolutionary trope; writing feels overly ornate at times, lacking nuanced emotional depth and individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but feels forced around them rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a limitation, not a choice.</comment>
