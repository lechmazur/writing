<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jack's motivation to preserve healing traditions is clear, but his personality as a "spirited lumberjack" lacks depth beyond physical description and "graceful awkwardness," which feels more stated than shown through distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between decoding the letter and the future war feels underdeveloped, with pacing rushed at the end, leaving cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ossuary-restaurant setting is evocative and ties to the bone motif, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the bike ride timeframe feels disconnected from the central mood and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of forgotten knowledge and future conflict, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; dialogue is intriguing yet too brief to feel fully natural or purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a lumberjack decoding future war messages is unique, the execution relies on generic descriptors and predictable "chosen guardian" tropes without fresh subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative elements like the ossuary setting, but the style lacks clarity in tying all threads together, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
