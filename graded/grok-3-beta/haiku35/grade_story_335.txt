<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra's portrayal as a shaky mercenary with a "carefully reckless" attribute is intriguing, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a generic quest for peace with the past; reactions to the amber are symbolic but not revelatory of unique personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "finalizing" feels vague and lacks a concrete resolution; pacing is uneven with overly reflective passages slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artist’s haven is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of improbable longing; however, the timeframe of the "echoing hour" feels underutilized and disconnected from the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through symbolism of the amber and spider, with effective metaphors, but the emotional impact is diluted by repetitive introspection; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., spider as confinement) feel familiar and not entirely fresh; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
