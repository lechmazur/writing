<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria's no-nonsense yet empathic nature is evident in her dedication to preservation, but her inner emotional landscape and personal stakes remain underexplored, limiting depth in character motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a distinct arc or conflict within the tight word limit; while the concept of preserved traditions shapes the narrative, the story feels more like a vignette than a complete structure with clear progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting Aria's mission, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of loss and resilience through strong imagery and symbolism, but the lack of a central conflict and over-reliance on telling rather than showing emotions dampens overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and perspective, some metaphors (e.g., "captured memories") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated themes rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive tone and leaves a lingering sense of remembrance, but the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, and the lack of a clear conflict hinders deeper engagement.</comment>
