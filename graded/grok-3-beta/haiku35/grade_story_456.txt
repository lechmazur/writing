<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand cosmic cycles through decay is clear, but Aria's personality feels underdeveloped beyond her profession; her "neutrally passionate" trait lacks depth in action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the subtle electromagnetic pulse as a climax lacks sufficient buildup or resolution, leaving the narrative fragmented despite thematic intent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is evocative and enhances the mystical tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the character's work feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (candle as life/death) and a reflective ending, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; lacks a sharp central conflict within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in the concept of a morbid florist, but reliance on generic descriptors (e.g., "profound poetry") and predictable life-death symbolism detracts from uniqueness; tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward ornate over clarity; brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
