<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena’s transition from cook to seismologist is intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond obsession; her personality doesn’t fully shape her actions with nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between forgotten letters and seismic prediction lacks clear cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility setting enhances the story’s tension, and the tone of frenzied tranquility fits well, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with geological communication, but emotional impact is limited by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a cook-seismologist is original, some metaphors (e.g., pencil eraser as relic) feel forced, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
