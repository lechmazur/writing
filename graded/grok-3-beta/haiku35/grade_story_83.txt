<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to expose dangerous experiments is clear, but the "suspiciously trusting" attribute feels underexplored in action or consequence; lacks depth in voice or nuanced reaction to the setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the burn pattern discovery drives intrigue but lacks resolution or clear progression, leaving the narrative fragmented and pacing uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of broken mirrors creates a striking atmosphere and complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the leaf-raking timeframe feels disconnected from the lab's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story hints at deeper meaning with mirrors and cryptid glimpses, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending lacks punch, and conflict remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Some originality in the mirror imagery, but reliance on generic descriptors and predictable cryptid tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than evoked.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate; leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
