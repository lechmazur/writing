<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation to resurrect human emotion is clear and aligns with her role as an awed astronomer, but her personality lacks depth beyond this mission; her reactions to the wedding veil feel symbolic rather than personal, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (Elena's mission), middle (her methodology), and end (her realization), but pacing feels rushed; the connection between snowflake patterns and emotional resurrection is conceptually intriguing yet logically tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a haunting, isolated atmosphere that complements the tone of loss and hope; sensory details like "frost-etched window" and "shifting ice floes" are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about emotion versus rationality and uses strong symbolism (wedding veil, snowflakes), but the emotional impact is diluted by overt explanation rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding emotions via snowflakes is original, the narrative leans on somewhat generic descriptors ("mathematical perfection") and overused metaphors (ice mirroring internal conflict); emotional handling is more stated than nuanced, and the style feels slightly formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering question about emotion’s value, though creative integration of elements is only moderately striking.</comment>
