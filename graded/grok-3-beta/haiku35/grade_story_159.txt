<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with an earnestly frivolous pursuit of the labyrinth, but Marcus lacks a distinct voice or deeper emotional layers; his transformation feels more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between betrayal and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are overly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the confetti-coded proposals and kaleidoscope as a tool, but some metaphors feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a thought but lacks the depth for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
