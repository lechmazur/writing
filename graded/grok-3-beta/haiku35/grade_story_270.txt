<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra's cynicism and humble arrogance are well-defined and shape his approach to the arcane, but his deeper motivations remain somewhat opaque, lacking emotional depth or personal stakes beyond intellectual curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with the awakening driving the narrative, but pacing feels unevenâ€”key moments are rushed while descriptive passages linger, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forgotten lighthouse library and eerie nostalgia create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like salt-encrusted walls; however, the setting's connection to character motivation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective on isolation and the ephemeral, some metaphors (e.g., "echo in a canyon") feel generic, and the tone occasionally veers into overly ornate prose, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style sometimes prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
