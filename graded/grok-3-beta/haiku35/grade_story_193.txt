<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of curing loneliness is clear, but Aleksander's personality lacks depth beyond exile and longing; reactions to the mortar and pestle feel symbolic but not personal enough to reveal unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning (exile), middle (encounter), and subtle resolution (transformation), but pacing feels rushed at the end; cause and effect between snowstorm and encounter are logical, though underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned customs office is evocative and enhances the liminal tone; sensory details like frosted windows and creaking floors immerse effectively, though smell and taste are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a sense of mystery and transformation through symbolism (mortar and pestle, key), but emotional impact is muted by lack of specific character depth; ending feels purposeful yet slightly vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s, but metaphors like "white canvas" feel somewhat generic; emotional resonance is present but relies on stated feelings over nuanced showing; style is distinct yet not wholly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements integrated in service of a larger theme of transformation; brief length works as a deliberate vignette, though depth is limited; leaves a lingering sense of potential but not profound impact.</comment>
