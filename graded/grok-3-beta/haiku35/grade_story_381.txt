<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems is clear, but Elena's personality as a hushed necromancer lacks depth; her spectral abilities feel tacked on rather than integral to her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; while the discovery of tunnels is intriguing, the pacing is uneven, and the story lacks a definitive resolution or clear middle progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like pulsing walls, enhancing atmosphere, but the futuristic nostalgia tone feels underexplored and disconnected from the mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a necromancer-geologist is unique, the narrative relies on generic descriptors like "spectral echoes" and predictable discovery tropes without fresh subversion or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style leans overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering curiosity but lacks profound depth or creative spark.</comment>
