<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elena's desire to navigate unspoken boundaries, but her personality lacks depth beyond a surface-level "carefully careless" demeanor; her voice feels indistinct in dialogue and internal thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the blood drive encounter and current events is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with the haunted mansion dining room and twilight timeframe enhancing the tone of "loud silence"; sensory details like the stillness and shadows are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild tension through subtext and unspoken agreements, with effective metaphors like the botanical specimens, but the emotional impact is limited by restrained character depth; dialogue feels purposeful yet slightly stiff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in the silent agreement concept, but metaphors like "spider silk" feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply resonant, leaning on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with a deliberate brevity, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly memorable impact; style supports clarity but doesn't elevate beyond functional.</comment>
