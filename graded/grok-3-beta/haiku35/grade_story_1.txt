<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's phobia is well-integrated into his identity as a stunt double, but his motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in execution; reactions to the net and setting reveal fear, yet his voice and personality remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between garage sales and the pyramid library feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with the climax feeling rushed and cause-effect links somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pyramid library setting is evocative with strong sensory details like dust motes and stillness, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the timeframe of garage sales feels disconnected and underutilized, weakening overall cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's transformation, with some effective imagery and subtext about courage; however, the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a phobia-ridden stunt double is intriguing, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of ancient mysteries without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often overextended, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the net and library, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a deeply resonant one.</comment>
