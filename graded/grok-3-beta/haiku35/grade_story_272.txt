<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's social awkwardness is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; it lacks depth beyond surface-level traits, and his interaction with the whistle reveals little new about his inner world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the decoding action driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more implied than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The diner setting during the late shift effectively complements the tone of restless acceptance and enhances Marcus's isolation; sensory details like flickering lights and clinking cutlery are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild intellectual curiosity about forgotten arts, but emotional resonance is limited; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and while imagery is present, subtext and deeper themes remain shallow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s but lacks a truly unique voice; metaphors like "tree of regret" feel slightly generic, and emotional portrayal leans toward telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but they often feel like scaffolding rather than organic components; it leaves a lingering thought about technological history, yet lacks the depth for a truly memorable impact.</comment>
