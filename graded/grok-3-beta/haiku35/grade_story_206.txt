<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation as a candy sculptor with a vendetta is clear, and her precise creativity shapes her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the revenge trope, and her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the counterattack driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between personal vendetta and broader historical truth is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the tone of loss and resistance, with evocative imagery of decay, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere could be more immersive to support Elena’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the theme of resurrection, and sugar sculptures as symbols of memory are compelling, but the ending feels more declarative than impactful, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of sugar sculptures as coded messages is original, the narrative leans on familiar rebellion tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like sugar sculptures, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
