<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to uncover a conspiracy tied to his wife's death is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond vigilance and determination; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from discovery to impending reckoning, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and some connections between evidence and conspiracy remain vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orchard setting is evocative and ties to Marcus's identity, but the paper airplane test facility lacks sensory detail; atmosphere supports the tone of suspicion, yet overall immersion is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at emotional depth through Marcus's loss, and the peacock tail metaphor is intriguing, but the impact is diluted by overt exposition and a lack of nuanced subtext or showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the conspiracy angle offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar revenge tropes without subversion; metaphors like the peacock tail feel forced at times, and emotional resonance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; it lacks a lingering depth or stylistic clarity that would elevate it beyond a functional draft.</comment>
