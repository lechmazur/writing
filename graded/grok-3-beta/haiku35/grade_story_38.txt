<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around non-violence is clear and consistent, but Marcus lacks a distinct voice or deeper personal conflict beyond his philosophical stance, making him feel somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the buildup to the after-party lacks resolution or a strong middle, leaving the narrative somewhat fragmented despite thematic coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting effectively enhances the mood of forgotten histories and quiet revolution, with evocative details, though sensory immersion could be deeper to fully ground the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with botanical samples and whispered warnings, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of non-violence through botanical metaphors is fresh, some imagery feels overly ornate and forced, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on non-violence, though depth feels constrained by the brief length.</comment>
