<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character development is solid with Marcus's repressed poet identity shaping his internal conflict and actions, especially through his interaction with the perfume bottle; however, his voice feels slightly underdeveloped due to limited dialogue or distinct narrative style.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from doubt to liberation, driven by the spontaneous decision and ambush of words, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The overgrown city street setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like ivy-draped walls and morning glories, enhancing the atmosphere of rebirth and complementing the character’s motivation exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with effective imagery and symbolism (perfume as memory, skin as canvas), evoking emotional resonance and deeper themes of fear and expression, though the ending feels slightly predictable, missing a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of writing on skin and the metaphor of repression as compost, but some phrases (e.g., “green womb”) veer into familiar poetic tropes, and emotional nuance occasionally lacks subtlety, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the perfume bottle and setting, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, though style occasionally overreaches into ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
