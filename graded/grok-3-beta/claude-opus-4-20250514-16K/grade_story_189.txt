<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's literal-mindedness shapes her unique approach to decoding and dismisses ghostly interference, but her deeper emotional depth and personal stakes remain underdeveloped, leaving her motivations somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by decoding star maps with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a nuanced emotional beat to ground the grand revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-water-war timeframe create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like phosphorescent algae, though the setting’s connection to Mira’s motivation could be more deeply explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes hope through its starlight imagery and offers subtext about survival, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the lack of dialogue limits character voice; it shows more than tells, yet emotional resonance is restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of star maps to water-rich worlds is original, some descriptions (e.g., "hope written in starlight") veer into cliché without subversion, and Mira’s logical approach lacks nuanced human emotion, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the phone booth key, leaving a lingering sense of possibility, but it struggles with deeper emotional impact and stylistic flair, feeling more functional than transcendent.</comment>
