<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's background as a trapper transitioning to hunting information is intriguing, and her motivation to combat collective despair is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the functional; her voice in dialogue feels slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning tied to Mara's hunt and an end focused on distributing hope, but the pacing feels rushed, and the black hole concept's integration into the narrative lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting is vividly rendered and complements the tone of gritty whimsy; sensory details like magnetized boots clicking and starlight on sea glass enhance immersion, though the atmosphere's connection to the black hole concept feels strained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through memories and hope, with effective imagery like "microdoses of joy," but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict of grief versus hope remains underdeveloped within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of emotional dark matter is original, some metaphors like "hunting for radiance" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the narrative tone wavers slightly in consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like sea glass and the observatory, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but overly complex ideas like the black hole of doubt hinder clarity and make the brevity feel somewhat limiting.</comment>
