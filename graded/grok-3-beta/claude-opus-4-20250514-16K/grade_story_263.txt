<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brother Tide's motivation is clear—grappling with doubt and morality through the plush and echoes—but his personality feels slightly underdeveloped beyond the 'calculatedly playful' attribute, lacking deeper emotional texture in his internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit through the ritual of reversed echoes, but pacing feels uneven, with heavy exposition dominating the middle, leaving the resolution somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coral reef city setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of introspection, with sensory details like parrotfish crunching coral adding depth; however, the timeframe of nature walks feels underutilized as a narrative driver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on morality's duality with strong subtext via the echoes, and the ending is purposeful; yet, the emotional resonance is muted by a lack of deeper character vulnerability, relying more on concept than feeling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in the reversed echoes concept and avoids overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., morality as refraction) feel familiar, and emotional depth occasionally leans on explicit statement rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the plush and echoes, and it leaves a lingering question on morality; however, the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
