<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seasoned woodsman’s motivation to map abandoned railways is clear and ties to his secretive nature, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; his despair and regret are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between short-circuiting the garden and the daughter’s consciousness upload lacks clear causality, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like “phantom flowers” and “rusted antenna sculptures,” enhancing the mood of loss, though the setting’s connection to the hairbrush feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the father-daughter bond and has strong imagery like “constellation of forgotten paths,” but the ending feels overly neat, and the theme of honesty freeing the daughter lacks deeper subtext or complexity beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story offers an original take on electromagnetic railways and radio gardens, avoiding clichés, with fresh metaphors, though some emotional descriptions (e.g., “tears mixing with his weathered smile”) feel slightly generic and lack nuanced showing over telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the hairbrush and radio garden, leaving a lingering emotional impact, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
