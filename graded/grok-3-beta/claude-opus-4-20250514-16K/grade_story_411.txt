<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to collect unspoken confessions is clear, but the sentient car mechanic's personality lacks depth beyond the role of curator; the "repulsively attractive" trait feels underexplored in influencing actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect relationships between soul fragments and orchard growth are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subterranean orchard and underground river of stars create a striking, evocative atmosphere that enhances the tone of exultant grief; sensory details like astral light are vivid, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through confessions and exultant grief, with strong imagery and subtext of loss, but the central conflict remains underdeveloped, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is imaginative, some metaphors (e.g., "river of stars") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable mystical tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
