<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Margot's dutiful nature and eager jadedness shape her actions, but her motivation feels surface-level; deeper internal conflict or nuance in her emotional armor (the glove) is missing, making her voice less distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between stolen phones and confessions are logical, yet the auditions' integration into the narrative lacks depth, diminishing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary setting is evocative and complements the tone of graceless beauty; sensory details like oxygen tanks and morphine drips enhance mood, though smell and touch are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through authentic voices of the dying, with strong subtext about mortality; the ending is purposeful, but dialogue is sparse and craft feels unevenâ€”some imagery shines, yet 'showing' over 'telling' is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of dying patients leaving recordings is original, the execution leans on predictable hospice tropes without full subversion; metaphors are fresh at times but emotions are occasionally stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative use of voice notes and the glove; it leaves a lingering thought on mortality, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
