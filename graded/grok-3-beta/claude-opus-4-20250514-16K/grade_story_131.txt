<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira’s aloofness as an orphan shapes her isolation and reluctance to connect, but her internal transformation feels slightly rushed within the word limit, lacking deeper exploration of her emotional barriers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the garage’s ascent symbolizing Mira’s surrender, though pacing feels mildly cramped; cause and effect are logical, but some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized with sensory details like floating objects and groaning foundations, enhancing the surreal atmosphere and supporting Mira’s transformation, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through Mira’s shift from fear to acceptance, with strong symbolism in the stones and garage; the ending is satisfying, but subtext could be deeper with more nuanced conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of floating due to a gravitational anomaly is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “guardian spirits”) feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the stones and anomaly, leaving a lingering sense of surrender to the unknown, though style occasionally leans on overt explanation over implication.</comment>
