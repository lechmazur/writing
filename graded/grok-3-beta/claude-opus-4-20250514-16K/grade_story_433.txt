<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness and brokenness are evident, shaping her initial stubbornness and eventual softening, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper backstory for full impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between prophecy and resolution could be more logically reinforced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the ephemeral art gallery amid snow days is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the mood of transience and isolation, though the atmosphere could more consistently reflect the character's inner struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on power and surrender with effective symbolism (pressed flowers, dissolving gallery), but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by overt exposition rather than deeper 'showing' of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a gallery existing only during snow days is original, some metaphors (e.g., "mountain's silence wrapped around her like forgiveness") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is present but not fully textured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the gallery and prophecy, leaving a lingering sense of peace, but stylistic choices occasionally lean toward overwriting, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
