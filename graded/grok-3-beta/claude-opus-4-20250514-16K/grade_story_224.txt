<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The minstrel’s yearning for escape is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single motivation; his "openly private" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though the meteorite's role in driving the story feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The giant’s dining room and rush hour setting create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the tone of gentle turmoil could be more consistently woven into the setting’s mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the minstrel’s transformation, with effective symbolism in the meteorite; yet, the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the ending feels more predictable than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., “cosmic dust in his eyes”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully explored in favor of stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brevity feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competently told tale.</comment>
