<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s tension as a bodyguard and his stubbornness are well-integrated into his motivation to gain freedom, but his inner conflict lacks deeper emotional texture; his voice feels distinct yet somewhat restrained in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a satisfying resolution within the word limit, driven by the action of ratification; pacing is managed well, though the buildup to the climax feels slightly rushed with limited exploration of intermediate tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of isolation and longing, complementing the tone of serene anger; sensory details are present but could be more varied to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Marcus’s quiet victory, with effective imagery like the photograph; however, the central conflict lacks deeper subtext, and the ending, while purposeful, misses a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the lunar setting and personal stakes offer some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of servitude and rebellion without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown through subtle action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the greenhouse and overheard stories, but the style occasionally lacks sharpness; it leaves a mild lingering thought of freedom, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
