<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as a social media exorcist shapes her actions uniquely, and her motivation to help others escape digital hauntings is clear, but her personal backstory feels underdeveloped. Her voice is distinct yet lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reigniting a lost ability driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end. Cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting enhances the ritualistic mood and complements the tone of indifferent enthusiasm. Sensory details like rusted tiles and forgotten meals are evocative, though more varied sensory input could deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about digital identity and has strong imagery (e.g., digital confetti), but the emotional impact is muted due to limited character depth. The theme of raw experience is clear, though subtext could be more layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, and metaphors like deleted posts dancing are fresh, but some descriptors (e.g., analog wonder) feel slightly generic. Emotional handling shows nuance, though not consistently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or question. Style supports clarity, though emotional resonance could be stronger.</comment>
