<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s guarded nature and skeptically credulous trait are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve crafts feels surface-level and lacks depth in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with decrypting vows driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between betrayal and action are thinly drawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is evocative and ties symbolically to containment, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully amplify Lyra’s emotional conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story hints at deeper themes of legacy and betrayal, emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but lacks resonance due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in the nano-forest concept, but character reactions lack nuanced emotion, and the narrative style feels somewhat formulaic, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering idea of freedom over control, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
