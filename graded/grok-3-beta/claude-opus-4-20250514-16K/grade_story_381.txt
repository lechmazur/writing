<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Vex's hushed necromancer trait is intriguing but her motivations feel surface-level and underexplored within the word limit, missing a distinct personal voice or nuanced reaction to her abilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the mapping action drives the story logically, though connections between nostalgia and necromancy are underdeveloped, leaving some cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing the futuristic tone and action; however, the atmosphere's connection to Vex's motivation feels slightly forced, lacking deeper emotional resonance with the timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the concept of resolve in crystals, but emotional resonance is limited by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks subtext or lasting depth, and dialogue with MORI feels functional rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining necromancy with quantum caves and movie references, avoiding overt clich√©s; however, sensory details occasionally feel generic, and emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it doesn't fully transcend the constraints of brevity; it leaves a lingering idea of nostalgia, yet clarity is hindered by underdeveloped character depth and thematic exploration.</comment>
