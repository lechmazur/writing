<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters like the bard and Mortimer have distinct voices and motivations, but their development feels surface-level; deeper emotional stakes or backstory are missing for true resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the bard's action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, sacrificing depth for resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has a satisfying end, with creative imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional impact; dialogue is purposeful but not always natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in concept with fresh metaphors, but relies on some predictable tropes (ghost humor, cosmic restoration) without subversion; emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
