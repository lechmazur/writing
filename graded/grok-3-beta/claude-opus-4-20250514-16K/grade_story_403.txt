<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with overemphasis on philosophical musings over action; coherence is maintained, though transitions are occasionally abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating library is vividly rendered with imaginative sensory details, enhancing the surreal tone; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery evokes thought and emotion, with subtext on perception and meaning; yet, the ending feels slightly overwrought, diluting its impact, and conflict resolution is abstract.</comment>
