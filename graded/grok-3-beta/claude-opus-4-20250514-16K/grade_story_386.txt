<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marya’s motivation to preserve her empire’s memory is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond quiet defiance. Her interaction with the tablecloth reveals cultural longing, yet her voice remains indistinct, blending into the narrative without a unique tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the alignment of stars driving a coherent climax. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the cause-effect link between the tablecloth and memory retrieval is conceptually intriguing but not fully grounded logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and temporal boundary create a striking, cohesive setting that enhances the mood of loss and hope. Sensory details are sparse but effective when used, though the atmosphere could be deepened with more tactile or olfactory imagery to match the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through its theme of remembrance, with strong symbolism in the lighthouse beam as a “borrowed dawn.” The ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and some emotions are told rather than shown, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its blend of sci-fi and emotional resonance, avoiding overt clichés. However, some metaphors (e.g., “luminous moths”) feel slightly overused, and emotional handling occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on explicit statements over subtext. Tone remains consistent but not uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope and purpose. The brief length works as a deliberate choice, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity at key moments.</comment>
