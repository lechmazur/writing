<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus Finch’s vigilance and orchardist background are well-integrated into his investigative drive, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; grief is stated rather than felt, lacking nuanced reactions beyond sardonic glee.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed in the resolution; the conspiracy unravels too quickly within the word limit, sacrificing depth for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is an intriguing backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the tone of sardonic glee or Marcus’s grief, missing opportunities for immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus’s vindication, with effective symbolism in the peacock seal, but dialogue feels stilted and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>While the conspiracy angle offers some originality, the story leans on predictable grief-driven revenge tropes without subversion; metaphors like “fruit ready for harvest” feel slightly overused, and emotional portrayal lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it feels complete yet lacks a truly lingering question or depth beyond the plot.</comment>
