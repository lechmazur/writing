<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as a professional cuddler shapes her outsider status and motivation, but her internal conflict and growth feel underdeveloped within the word limit; her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a symbolic resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the ticket punch and societal change is conceptually intriguing yet logically tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar enhances the theme of decay and forgotten dreams, with strong sensory details of rust and vastness, though the atmosphere occasionally feels disconnected from Mira’s immediate emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional resonance through themes of prejudice and connection, with decent use of symbolism (ticket punch as validation), but the ending feels more conceptual than impactful, and subtext is unevenly explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of touch workers and phantom tickets offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "stretched like taffy") are clichéd, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is more intellectual than emotional.</comment>
