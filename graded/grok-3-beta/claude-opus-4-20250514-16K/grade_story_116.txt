<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative details of the sky-lounge and endless city, strongly supporting the mood; however, sensory details could be more varied beyond visual imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and depth is constrained by the short length's impact on character exploration.</comment>
