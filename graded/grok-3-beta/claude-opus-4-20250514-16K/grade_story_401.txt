<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation tied to guilt and her sister’s death is clear, and her background as a wilderness guide informs her skills, but her emotional arc feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper internal conflict or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional beats; the action of equalizing is conceptually intriguing but not fully integrated into driving the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken pirate ship ballroom is vividly rendered with sensory details like barnacle-crusted chandeliers and fish, enhancing the atmosphere of loss and discovery; however, the coffee ritual feels slightly discordant with the underwater setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elena’s release of guilt and uses strong imagery (blanket as jellyfish), with subtext of forgiveness; yet, the ending feels a bit too neat, and the central conflict lacks sustained tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the underwater decoding of a blanket is original, some metaphors (extra oxygen tank) feel familiar, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; overall style is distinct but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of setting and theme, leaving a lingering thought about forgiveness; however, the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
