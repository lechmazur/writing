<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as a sincere rebel is evident, and her motivation to preserve building traditions is clear, but her internal conflict and emotional depth lack nuance; her reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between theorizing and plot progression is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms are evocatively paired, with strong sensory details like the "living throat" imagery, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone and less tied to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Maya's determination, with effective imagery and a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict resolution feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in the concept of a living passage, metaphors like "braided bitterness" feel forced, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
