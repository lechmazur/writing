<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's dry wit is present but underdeveloped, offering occasional insight into her personality but lacking depth in motivation beyond duty. Her reaction to the rope and dance reveals a personal connection, yet her voice feels somewhat muted in dialogue and internal reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the dance and eroding promises driving the narrative, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Pacing is managed decently, though the ghostly figuresâ€™ introduction disrupts coherence momentarily with insufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom is vividly rendered with salt-stained windows and moonlight, enhancing the eerie tone. Sensory details are effective, but the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly tied to the atmosphere of broken vows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism (rope as broken vows) effectively. The ending is purposeful, but dialogue feels sparse and lacks natural flow. Subtext around duty and tradition is present, though not fully layered or resonant enough for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story shows originality in linking dance to a binding ritual, avoiding overly formulaic tropes, but some metaphors (ink like tears) are predictable. Emotional nuance is attempted but leans on stated feelings rather than deep showing, and the style feels occasionally forced rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, showing creative thought in combining dance and rope. However, the style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper resonance.</comment>
