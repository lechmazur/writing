<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vera's ruthless flower arranger trait is intriguing and ties to her precision, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the watcher’s burden is mentioned but not deeply felt in her actions or dialogue. Her voice is distinct, though inconsistent at times between playful anarchy and serious purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of distinguishing petroglyphs driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed toward the end. The connection between beginning and end is present but lacks depth; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is vividly described and enhances the mood of secrecy and discovery. Sensory details like morning mist and the singer’s voice add immersion, though some elements (like the comb-stone connection) feel underexplored in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity with its hidden knowledge theme, and the comb as a cipher is a memorable device. However, emotional resonance is limited, and the ending feels more clever than satisfying. Dialogue is natural but not particularly impactful; subtext is present but shallow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers some originality with the comb as a key to ancient puzzles, avoiding overt clichés, but Vera’s character reasoning feels overly logical at times, lacking human nuance. Metaphors like “broken teeth” are fresh, though sensory details can be generic. Tone is mostly consistent but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with its elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface. Creative thinking is evident in combining elements, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
