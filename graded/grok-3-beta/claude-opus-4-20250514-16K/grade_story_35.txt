<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, tied to recovering emotional language, but development feels surface-level; the gardener's personality lacks distinct depth beyond quietude and trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; connections between memory flickers and the final journal reveal are logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the Translation Center enhances the theme of language and understanding; sensory details like bird calls are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with embroidery as emotional language; emotional impact is present but not fully resonant due to limited character depth; ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors (e.g., candlelight through fog) are fresh, but others feel familiar; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, yet the narrative lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with thoughtful integration of elements; brief length works, but depth is sacrificed; leaves a lingering thought about language and memory, though not profoundly so.</comment>
