<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s transition from surgeon to bartender to crystallographer is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from grief to obsessive collection lacks depth in emotional nuance. His actions align with the jaded trait, yet his voice remains indistinct, missing a personal edge in narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, connecting past failure to present triumph, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the doodle revelation. Cause and effect are logical, yet the global solution emerges too conveniently, straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The crystal lab setting and New Year’s Eve timeframe pair effectively to build tension, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to immerse in the sterile lab or festive atmosphere. The mood of optimistic desperation is supported, though inconsistently vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus’s redemption and offers subtext about healing from unexpected sources. The ending is satisfying, but literary devices like symbolism of the scalpel feel heavy-handed. Conflict is clear but resolved too neatly; theme of fate is present yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of doodles as a global cure is original, but the narrative leans on the trope of a fallen professional finding redemption without subversion. Emotional handling shows nuance in places, yet some descriptions (e.g., “optimistic desperation”) feel stated rather than shown. Style is distinct but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, though some feel forced (e.g., doodles as method). Creative thinking is evident in linking grief to science, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is moderate, not profound.</comment>
