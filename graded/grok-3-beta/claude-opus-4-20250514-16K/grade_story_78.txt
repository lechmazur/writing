<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elena's late-blooming heroism and softly militant demeanor are well-portrayed, shaping her leadership, but her motivation to dissect cosmic balance feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in action alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with coercion driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the cosmic balance concept's influence on plot direction remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is vivid and enhances the tone of reluctant awe, with strong sensory details like the spyglass and soil-hauling, though the timeframe's integration is less impactful on atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on loss and resilience with effective imagery (plants as memorials), but dialogue feels slightly stiff, and the central conflict resolves too neatly, missing deeper subtext in the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique perspective on loss, some metaphors (e.g., "persistent as rain") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies occasionally on telling rather than showing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate in exploring depth.</comment>
