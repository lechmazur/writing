<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with the exiled prince's loneliness and iconic status shaping his actions, but his motivations lack deeper complexity; the dialogue feels slightly contrived, missing a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat predictable, lacking a sharper twist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details of snow and decay in the customs office, enhancing the mood of isolation; however, the settingâ€™s connection to the broader timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of loneliness, with effective symbolism in the mortar and pestle, but the ending feels too tidy, lacking lingering tension or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is middling; while the concept of a healing prince is intriguing, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of redemption and connection without significant subversion, and some metaphors feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with thoughtful use of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a mild impression rather than a profound lingering thought.</comment>
