<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus Thorne’s role as a soul-broker is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; while his stillness and craft are unique, there’s little insight into why he pursues this path beyond surface-level duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between reading reversed labels and soul-matching feels tenuous and underexplained, leading to a slightly disjointed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating tea platform and recycling currents create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the ethereal tone; however, sensory details are sparse, limiting deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet melancholy and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., reversed labels as forgotten memories), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper character insight; dialogue feels purposeful yet limited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original premise with the soul-broker concept, avoiding overt clichés, though some metaphors (souls as moths) feel familiar; the tone is consistent, and emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the short length seems to constrain deeper development; it leaves a lingering thought about memory, though not powerfully so.</comment>
