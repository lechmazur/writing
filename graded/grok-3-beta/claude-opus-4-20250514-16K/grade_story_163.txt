<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a lost heiress with a family curse is intriguing, but Elara's personality lacks depth beyond "bitterly optimistic," and her actions feel driven more by plot necessity than distinct voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, and the action of unifying reality drives the story, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid, with the xenobiology research station and cloud migration creating a strong mood; sensory details like phasing walls are effective, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes thought on reality and inheritance, with decent imagery like "jellyfish through cosmic oceans," but the ending lacks profound impact, and subtext on unification feels surface-level rather than layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is mixed; the fragmented reality concept is fresh, but execution leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting deeper resonance.</comment>
