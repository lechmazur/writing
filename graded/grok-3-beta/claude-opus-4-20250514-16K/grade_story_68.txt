<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by the action of restoring Cassia’s name, with a clear arc despite the word limit. Pacing is managed well, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman marketplace is vividly realized with sensory details like holographic awnings and metallic clinks, enhancing the futuristic atmosphere. The setting supports the action, though the connection to tea steeping feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about humanity in machines, with strong imagery like “gardener’s gloves.” The ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character depth. Theme of redemption is clear, though subtext could be richer.</comment>
