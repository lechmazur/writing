<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for mastering time is clear, and the "polite bandit" trait shapes Maya's courteous demeanor effectively, but her deeper personality lacks nuance and her silent eloquence feels more stylistic than revealing of character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the concept of shattered allegiances drives the conflict, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The electronic wilderness refuge and classroom timeframe blend creatively, with evocative imagery like firewalls as pine trees, though sensory details beyond sight and sound are sparse, limiting full atmospheric immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on time and betrayal, with decent use of metaphor (time as origami), but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels more symbolic than deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining digital and natural imagery, avoiding overt clich√©s, though some metaphors (glass against silicon) feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than deeply felt, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
