<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development of Vera as a cold-natured knight is intriguing, with her motivation to preserve traditions clear, but her emotional shift feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict to fully ground her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax of her realization, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret agent center setting is evocatively sterile, enhancing the theme of cold preservation, and sensory details like the mitten's texture stand out, though the deserted intersection feels underutilized in atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Vera's awakening, with strong symbolism in the mitten and altars, but the ending lacks a sharper punch, and the theme of incompleteness could be woven more subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., frost vs. fire) feel familiar, and emotional resonance relies occasionally on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mitten and altars, and it leaves a lingering thought about preservation, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity.</comment>
