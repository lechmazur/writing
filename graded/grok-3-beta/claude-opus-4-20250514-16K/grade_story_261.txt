<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Yvette's borderline immortality and rigid flexibility shape her actions, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; her reactions to the earbud cover are intriguing yet lack deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to launch is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between ink patterns and restoration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is vividly realized and enhances the action, with bioluminescent histories adding atmosphere; sensory details are evocative, though some elements like smell or touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes hope and reflection, with strong imagery like "whitewash dissolving like sugar in rain"; the ending is satisfying, but subtext is somewhat surface-level, missing deeper thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a particle garden is original, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of hidden histories and restoration without subversion; metaphors are fresh but emotions are often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with complex imagery, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering sense of hope, though not profoundly so.</comment>
