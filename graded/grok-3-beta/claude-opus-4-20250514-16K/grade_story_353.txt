<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Martha's cynically gentle nature is well-reflected in her actions and backstory, but her inner conflict and voice lack depth; the motivation to dethrone the tyrant feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical cause-effect with the lunar timing and contagion, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the time machine calibration, reducing coherence and impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mystical atmosphere of speaking shadows and the time machine garage enhances the tone effectively, though sensory details are sparse, limiting full immersion in the bakery and underground settings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with bread and seeds as revolution, and the ending is purposeful; however, emotional resonance is muted by telling over showing, and the central conflict lacks nuanced escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining baking with temporal revolution, but some metaphors (e.g., "yeast of justice") feel forced, and emotional portrayal occasionally lacks human nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like moon patterns and shadows, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
