<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Marcus's guilt and desire for redemption driving his actions, but his internal conflict feels somewhat surface-level and lacks deeper nuance in his voice and reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution hinges too heavily on a single symbolic gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of resilience, with some effective symbolism, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the deeper subtext is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the execution relies on predictable redemption tropes without sufficient subversion, and emotional resonance is stated more than shown through nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
