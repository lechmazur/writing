<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth architect's motivation to uncover sacred geometry is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this obsession; her reactions and voice feel somewhat archetypal rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with evasion driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the elevator scene, and cause-effect relationships are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive setting enhances the thematic depth and complements the desperate tone, with evocative details like "cold steel wall," though sensory immersion is inconsistent and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional resonance through the unspoken bond and has strong imagery like "living mathematics," but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of labyrinthine migrations is original, some metaphors (e.g., "stars mapping an escape route") feel overused, and emotional handling occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate, and the style, while evocative, sometimes sacrifices clarity for ornate language.</comment>
