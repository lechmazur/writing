<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brother Kaine's motivation to bridge physical and digital realms is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond the cyber-templar archetype; the "patiently frantic" attribute is mentioned but not deeply explored in his actions or voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of proving a theory driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that enhances the tone of euphoric agitation; sensory details like vulture screeches and lightning are evocative, though some descriptions lack deeper tactile or olfactory grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes intellectual curiosity about reality's nature and uses strong imagery (light bending, storm recoiling), but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character depth; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a profound lingering impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of merging digital and physical is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "lightning threading purple veins") feel slightly overused; character reactions show nuance, but the narrative occasionally relies on explicit statements over subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the prism and sky burial, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a thought-provoking idea about reality, though not deeply emotional.</comment>
