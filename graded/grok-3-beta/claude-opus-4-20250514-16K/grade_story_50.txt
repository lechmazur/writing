<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Margot’s portrayal as an unconvinced missionary with capriciously consistent faith is intriguing, but her inner transformation lacks depth due to limited exploration of past struggles; motivation is clear but reactions feel somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with decoding piano echoes driving the story, but the resolution feels rushed and the connection between faith and magic isn’t fully earned; pacing is uneven with heavy focus on the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass desert setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like singing dunes, enhancing the tone of solitary intimacy; however, the butterfly migration timeframe feels slightly underexplored in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (fork, piano, butterfly) and subtext about doubt and transformation evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by abstract language; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers an original take on faith and magic, some metaphors (fork dissolving into light) feel overly ornate; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability in tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the glass desert and piano echoes, but overreliance on abstract concepts slightly hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about faith’s transformation, though impact is inconsistent.</comment>
