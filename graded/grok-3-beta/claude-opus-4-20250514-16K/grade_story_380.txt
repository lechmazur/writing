<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped; the dream thief's mathematical struggle and fragmented self are compelling concepts, but her actions and voice lack depth and consistency to fully embody these traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure feels incomplete; the arc from longing for thunder to the final plunge is ambitious but rushed within the word limit, with unclear cause-effect links between actions and fragmented self-concept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The treehouse library and post-human timeframe create a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of quiet mania, though sensory details are sparse and could better immerse the reader in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with strong imagery (album pages as white birds), but the emotional resonance and central conflict remain vague; the theme of fragmentation is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of a dream thief in a post-human world, but metaphors occasionally feel forced or generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative integration of elements, but cohesion suffers from underdeveloped character and plot; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks the polish for immediate publication.</comment>
