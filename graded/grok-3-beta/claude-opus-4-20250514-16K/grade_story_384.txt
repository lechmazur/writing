<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maria's frantic nature as a cook is clear, but her deeper personality and motivation lack nuance; her transition from cook to seismic predictor feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, connecting the walking stick discovery to seismic prediction, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of 'frenzied tranquility' is stated more than evoked through vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story offers a unique metaphor of earth as a kitchen, but emotional impact is limited by 'telling' over 'showing'; dialogue is functional but lacks distinct voice, and the ending feels more clever than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of culinary-seismic parallels is original and avoids common tropes, but some metaphors (e.g., earth as a recipe) feel slightly forced; emotional depth is present but not fully nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally prioritizes cleverness over emotional depth; it leaves a lingering idea, though not a profound impact.</comment>
