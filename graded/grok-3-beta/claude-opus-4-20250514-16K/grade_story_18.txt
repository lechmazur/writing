<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minerva's telepathy and tragic joy shape her actions convincingly, and her motivation to expose truth is consistent; however, her inner voice lacks distinctiveness, and secondary character Charlotte's transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a strong resolution, and the action of weatherizing drives the narrative effectively, but pacing feels uneven with some revelations packed too tightly at the end, risking coherence under the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly realized with sensory details like hissing pipes and soot-laden fog, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness and supporting Minerva's motivations; however, some atmospheric elements feel underutilized in relation to secondary characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through Minerva's revelations and Charlotte's crisis, with strong imagery like "writing truth in water's honest hand"; yet, the central conflict's resolution feels slightly too neat, and deeper subtext is only partially explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality with the living statue's telepathic revelations, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors like "lies crumbling like old mortar" feel familiar, and emotional nuance in secondary characters is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like telepathy and weatherizing, leaving a lingering question about sacrifice and purpose; however, the style occasionally leans ornate, slightly hindering clarity in a brief format.</comment>
