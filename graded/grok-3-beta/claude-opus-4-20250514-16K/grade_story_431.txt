<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by the knitting and decoding action, with a clear arc from discovery to resolution within the word limit; yet, the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a deeper exploration of the final revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cipher decoder's office and desolate wasteland setting enhance the tone of isolation and possibility, with evocative sensory details like "old paper and possibility"; however, the connection between the setting and broader timeframe could be more explicit to ground the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on resilience and hidden knowledge through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending; yet, the central conflict lacks a sharper edge of tension, and the theme of survival feels slightly understated for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original blend of dance, knitting, and decoding, avoiding common tropes, with fresh metaphors; however, some descriptors like "forgotten echoes" feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance occasionally leans toward stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
