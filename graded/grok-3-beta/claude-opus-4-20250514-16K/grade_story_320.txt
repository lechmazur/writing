<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's shy nature is portrayed adequately but lacks depth; her motivation to right a cosmic imbalance feels somewhat detached from her personality, missing a personal stake or emotional nuance that would make her actions more compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence within the word limit with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; the concept of regret drives the narrative effectively, though cause-effect links between timelines could be sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater market setting is evocative and supports the mood of hidden truths, with sensory details like trembling webbed fingers and flaring gills; however, the atmosphere could be further tied to Marinaâ€™s internal conflict for greater impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through the theme of regret, with some effective symbolism in the photographs; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying, lacking a stronger personal resolution for Marina.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of timeline-hopping and regret is inventive, the execution relies on somewhat predictable tragedy loops without fresh subversion; sensory details are specific but emotions are often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length exposes a lack of deeper emotional stakes; it leaves a lingering thought about regret, yet the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
