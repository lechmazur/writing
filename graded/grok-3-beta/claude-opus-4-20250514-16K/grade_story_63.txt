<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra's reserved nature and oracle role are evident in her measured actions and foresight, but her motivation to preserve art feels slightly underdeveloped; her personal connection to the cuffs is touching yet lacks deeper emotional conflict or stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to restoration is clear and cohesive within the word limit, with mending driving the narrative effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a moment of deeper tension or doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized and enhances the story’s mood of rediscovery, with choir vibrations adding sensory depth; however, some sensory details remain generic, missing an opportunity for sharper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the revival of lost songs, with strong imagery and symbolism in the cuffs and stitches; the ending is satisfying, but dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, lacks a bolder thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of sound in embroidery is original and well-executed, avoiding clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., "mending silence") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, though character nuance is not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the cuffs and laboratory; it leaves a lingering thought about memory, but the style occasionally leans ornate, slightly hindering clarity over depth.</comment>
