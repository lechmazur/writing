<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eloise's obsession for decoding, but her morally ambiguous nature feels underdeveloped; her theft lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance beyond a fleeting mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the xerograph revelation; causal links between grocery store and tower are tenuous and abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere at the smoke signal tower is evocative with strong sensory detail of dusk and stone, enhancing mood; however, the grocery setting feels underutilized and lacks vivid immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining seed packets with encoded secrets, but metaphors like "burning against her hip" are somewhat clich√©d; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a mild lingering thought about hidden knowledge, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
