<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transition from city planner to doomsday prepper is intriguing, and his motivation to escape self-imposed chains is clear, but his inner conflict lacks deeper nuance; his voice feels somewhat generic despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the ritual of unbinding driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between confessions and liberation are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative and complements the tone of daring caution, with strong imagery of broken constellations; however, sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional resonance through Marcus's confessions, and symbolism of chains and constellations is effective, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on self-liberation, some metaphors (e.g., "walls of own making") feel overused, and emotional depth is sometimes stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies; still, it maintains a consistent tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the ink blotter and constellations, but the brief length slightly hampers depth; it leaves a lingering thought about authenticity, though not powerfully so.</comment>
