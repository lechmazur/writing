<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Chen’s actions and the rumor’s resolution lacks depth, leaving some cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The futuristic headquarters and fractured tone create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like echoing footsteps and gleaming walls, though the setting’s connection to Chen’s motivation could be more explicitly tied to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about identity and reality through strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and dialogue from Voss, while purposeful, lacks natural flow, slightly diminishing emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of duplicated consciousness is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "toxic flower") feel generic, and emotional portrayal occasionally leans on telling rather than showing, missing deeper nuance; still, the style shows individual flair.</comment>
