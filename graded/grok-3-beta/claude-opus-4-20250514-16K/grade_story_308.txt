<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira’s bashfulness and role as an executioner are intriguing, but her inner conflict and motivation feel underexplored, lacking deeper emotional nuance beyond the surface narrative of preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the preservation of dance drives the story effectively, though pacing feels slightly rushed toward the end, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio and tidal imagery create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, strongly tied to the soothing tides concept, though some sensory details remain generic and could be more specific to heighten impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mira’s connection to her heritage, with strong tidal metaphors and a satisfying ending, but subtext is somewhat repetitive, and the central conflict lacks sharper stakes within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the tidal metaphors and cultural preservation are fresh, some imagery feels overused (e.g., “gentle as foam”), and emotional handling occasionally leans on explicit statement rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with thoughtful integration of elements like the tides and keychain, leaving a lingering sense of legacy, though it lacks the piercing depth or stylistic flair for top-tier impact.</comment>
