<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's vendetta is a strong motivator and shapes her actions consistently, particularly in her use of candy as a subversive tool. However, her personality lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice beyond her revenge, limiting the depth of character development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc from discovery to counterattack within the word limit, and the use of candy as a method is inventive. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and some causal links, like the sudden rebel breach, are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the atmosphere of secrecy and rebellion, and sensory details around sugar crafting are evocative. Yet, the broader world beyond the market feels vague, missing opportunities to deepen the totalitarian context through specific imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elara’s transformation from scorn to hope, and metaphors like sugar as evidence are striking. However, the central conflict’s resolution feels abrupt, and subtext, while present, lacks the sharpness needed for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés by subverting candy-making into a weapon of resistance, with fresh metaphors like “molten caramel” for anger. Still, some emotional descriptions are surface-level, and the hidden continent trope feels slightly predictable without a unique twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, with creative use of candy sculpting as a narrative driver. It leaves a lingering thought of hope, but stylistic choices occasionally lean ornate, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
