<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcel's transformation from pickpocket to poet is intriguing, but his motivation feels somewhat forced; the shift lacks deeper internal conflict or gradual realization, relying heavily on the dummy's influence rather than personal agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments of transformation, and the connection between beginning and end relies on a somewhat abrupt resolution without fully exploring the process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone, with strong sensory details like rusted gears and steam, though the timeframe "between appointments" feels underexplored and disconnected from the setting's potential depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on personal change through symbolism like the dummy and poetry, but the emotional impact is diminished by overt telling of transformation rather than nuanced showing; the ending feels purposeful yet slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a talking dummy driving transformation is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "crucible," "morning fog") feel overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than subtle subtext, risking a formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brevity feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on change, though not profoundly so.</comment>
