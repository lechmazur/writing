<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evangeline's motivation to recover her family’s legacy is clear, and her status as a broke aristocrat shapes her actions, but her inner conflict lacks deeper emotional nuance; her transformation feels slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the roller coaster's sudden activation lacks sufficient grounding in logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone and complements the concept of legacy’s burden; sensory details like fog and creaking wood are evocative, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Evangeline’s burden-to-purpose shift, with decent use of symbolism (illustrations as living recipes), but the ending feels predictable and lacks a truly striking impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of botanical recipes and a supernatural amusement park offers originality, some metaphors (creditors as vultures) are overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown with subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the botanical illustration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
