<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear as an obsessed crossword creator driven to help lost souls, but Elias's personality lacks depth beyond his purpose; his voice is indistinct, and reactions to the key ring feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with rewriting diaries driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the exponential growth of whispers introduces coherence issues with abrupt scale shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whisper collection point and starless night create a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of noble chaos and enhances the concept of reconciliation; sensory details like jangling keys are evocative but sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through souls finding peace, with strong symbolism in crosswords as maps home, but subtext is underdeveloped, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch; conflict is present but resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in combining crosswords with supernatural redemption, but relies on trope of "haunted helper" without subversion; metaphors like "seeds of reconciliation" are fresh yet inconsistently nuanced; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the key ring and diaries, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; brevity feels deliberate, yet depth is sacrificed, leaving impact somewhat surface-level.</comment>
