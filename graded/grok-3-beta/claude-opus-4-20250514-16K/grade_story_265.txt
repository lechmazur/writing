<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Deputy Martinez's impassive nature is well-integrated into her role as a stoic guardian, but her internal motivations lack depth; her emotional connection to the miracle feels stated rather than felt, missing nuanced personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; connections between uncharted echoes and the final revelation are intriguing yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lush orchard in an abandoned cathedral is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the mystical atmosphere; the setting powerfully supports the tone of cautious bravery and the concept of grace, though the timeframe of oil changes feels slightly detached.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of wonder through imagery and symbolism (orchard-cathedral marriage), with a satisfying ending; however, the central conflict is understated, and emotional resonance relies more on description than subtext or nuanced action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending nature and sacred decay, with fresh metaphors like roots as veins; yet, some descriptions (e.g., "pure possibility") lean toward generic abstraction, and emotional depth occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like beesâ€™ language and the cathedral orchard; it leaves a lingering sense of wonder, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
