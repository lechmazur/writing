<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's naivety as a gambler shapes her actions and hopefulness, but her motivations lack deeper exploration beyond surface-level desperation; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped due to limited internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a minimal arc within the word limit, with gambling driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than structural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting and candlelit dinners blend effectively to create a moody, isolated atmosphere; sensory details like crashing waves and flickering candles are vivid, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes bittersweet emotion and has clear subtext about futility, with a satisfying if melancholic ending; however, dialogue feels slightly expository, and the theme of inevitability could be shown more subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the perspective of a doomed station crew is somewhat fresh, the gambling trope feels predictable without significant subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a lingering sense of loss, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
