<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve lost wisdom is clear and consistent, shaped by her real visions as a faux fortune teller, but her personality lacks depth beyond the peaceful anger, and her voice isn't distinctly memorable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing is uneven—rushed visions disrupt the flow, and the action's impact on the narrative feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Extinct Language Archive setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood, paired well with the timeframe of planting season; sensory details like "cathedral light" are strong, though some atmospheric elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on lost knowledge with effective symbolism (bone flute), but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending is satisfying, though the central conflict lacks sharpness within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique angle on lost languages, some metaphors like "morning glories that bloom once" feel slightly clichéd; emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored, and the style lacks a distinct authorial stamp.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the bone flute, leaving a lingering thought on impermanence, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, and the style occasionally hinders clarity.</comment>
