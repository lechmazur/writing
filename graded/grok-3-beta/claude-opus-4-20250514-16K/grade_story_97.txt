<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Vera's fact-minded nature clashing against newfound empathy, but her transformation feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuanced progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed in the tight word limit, and the resolution lacks depth, leaning heavily on the concept of empathy without fully earning it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is vividly described and enhances the mood of disorientation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere occasionally feels detached from Vera's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Vera's heartbreak, with effective imagery like "whispered minute," but the theme of empathy feels overly explicit, lacking subtext or subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of an oracle learning empathy is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "sunrise") feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the compass, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is muted by a lack of depth.</comment>
