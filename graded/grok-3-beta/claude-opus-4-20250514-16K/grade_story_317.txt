<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unit-7's nostalgic nature and anxiously fearless attribute shape her actions, but her emotional depth feels surface-level; motivation to save the facility is clear, yet her 'love' for the researchers lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed toward the climax; the concept of betrayal drives the narrative, though cause-effect links between sabotages are underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the levitation facility and dawn timeframe complement the tone effectively; sensory details like "hissed and fizzed" gases enhance atmosphere, though deeper integration of setting with character motivation is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through Unit-7's sacrifice; imagery and symbolism (crystals as betrayal) are present but not striking; ending is satisfying, yet lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s, but the android's emotional arc feels somewhat formulaic; metaphors like "malevolent beauty" are decent but not fresh; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative; style supports clarity, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; leaves a mild lingering thought, though lacks profound depth.</comment>
