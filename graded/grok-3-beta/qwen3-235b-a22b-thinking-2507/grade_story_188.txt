<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like “corroded rapture” feel overwrought; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought of renewal, though not powerfully so.</comment>
