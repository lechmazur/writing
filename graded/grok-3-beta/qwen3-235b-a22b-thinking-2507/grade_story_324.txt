<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the action of jabbing driving a climactic moment, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and some cause-effect links, like the sudden rival presence, are abrupt and unexplained within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The simmering future and secret agent headquarters blend effectively to create a haunting atmosphere, with sensory details like echoing footsteps enhancing mood, though some connections between setting and object feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some thought with its theme of creation over duplication, and imagery like the fractured idyll is potent, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending feels more conclusive than lingering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of the dreamerâ€™s calling offers some originality, the narrative leans on sci-fi tropes without fully subverting them, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, with occasional overwrought phrases detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with dense phrasing, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
