<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to regret is clear, but Elias’s personality as a fireworks designer feels underexplored beyond the symbolic; lacks distinct voice or deeper nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a discernible resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the revelation; connection between frost and firework design is logical yet not fully seamless within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Waterfall library setting is vividly described with strong sensory detail (mist, roar), enhancing atmosphere and mood of transience; complements motivation, though car in cavern feels slightly incongruous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through regret and redemption, with effective frost symbolism; ending is purposeful, but lacks deeper subtext or lingering tension; shows more than tells, yet impact feels constrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in frost-firework metaphor, but overall narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; language is purposeful, though some descriptions (e.g., “emerald secrets”) verge on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity seems to limit depth rather than enhance it; leaves a mild lingering thought on transience, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
