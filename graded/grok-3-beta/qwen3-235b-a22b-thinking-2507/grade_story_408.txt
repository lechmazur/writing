<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s portrayal as a conscientious objector is clear and ties to his protective role over the orchard, but his motivation feels slightly repetitive and lacks deeper emotional nuance beyond duty and tradition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from guarding to subtle confrontation with the developer is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ravine orchard setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of danger and vigilance, though sensory details could be more varied beyond storm imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet tension and uses symbolism (rusty nail, storms) effectively, but the emotional impact is restrained, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the guardian-of-nature trope feels familiar without significant subversion; metaphors are functional but not striking, and emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally leans on exposition over showing, limiting depth; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
