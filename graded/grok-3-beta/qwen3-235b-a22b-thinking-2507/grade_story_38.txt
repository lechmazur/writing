<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to pursue non-violence is clear but feels underdeveloped; the insomniac poet's personality lacks distinct depth or voice beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a discernible resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and connections between confessions and botanical evidence are somewhat forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
