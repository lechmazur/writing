<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation to heal is clear and ties to his lumberjack past, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond "gracefully awkward," lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the coded letter driving tension, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolutions and unclear cause-effect links between nightmares and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ossuary restaurant setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of harsh tenderness, enhancing the healing theme, though sensory details are sparse and could be more immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Silas’s journey, with decent use of symbolism (bones, biking), but dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, lacks depth; it shows more than tells but isn’t fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, the narrative relies on predictable tropes of hidden agendas and healing as resistance without fresh subversion; metaphors are functional but not striking, and emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound one.</comment>
