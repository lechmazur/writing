<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of vapor-induced dreams and rewritten laws is original, some metaphors like “calcified trust” feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing, hinting at a lack of raw human texture.</comment>
