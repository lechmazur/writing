<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Elias Thorne’s coldly intense attribute shapes his focused determination, but his motivation lacks deeper nuance beyond survival and guilt; reactions to the diary reveal past betrayal, yet his voice feels distant and lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from betrayal to reckoning is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the concept of freedom drives the narrative, though cause-effect links between forest and theater are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly realized with sensory detail, enhancing the alien atmosphere and supporting Thorne’s motivation; however, the theater setting feels disconnected and underutilized in tone and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (fire, diary) evoke wonder and guilt, with a satisfying ending; yet emotional resonance is more stated than shown, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the brief scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the forest’s coding and burning diary as transformation, but metaphors like “liquid starlight” feel generic; emotional handling leans on explicit statements, and the dual setting risks feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration of forest and freedom; style supports imagery but overreaches with ornate phrasing at times; lingering impact is present but muted by rushed depth.</comment>
