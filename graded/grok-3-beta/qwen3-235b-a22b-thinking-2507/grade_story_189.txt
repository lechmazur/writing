<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode star maps is clear and consistent with the "uniquely literal" trait, shaping her methodical approach, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single dimension; reactions to ghostly notes and the phone key feel utilitarian rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from decoding to revelation of coordinates is complete within word limit, and "overcharge" drives tension, but pacing feels rushed at climax with capacitor explosion; cause-effect logic holds, though ghostly notes as method lack grounding in plot coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse basement enhances eerie tone and complements water war timeframe; sensory details like damp stones and salt-stung dawn are evocative, but setting’s connection to phone key feels tenuous and underutilized for deeper atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes hope through rebuilding theme, with effective imagery like "starlight fracturing across walls," but emotional resonance is surface-level; ending is satisfying, yet dialogue is minimal and subtext on sacrifice feels underdeveloped for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending star maps with aquifers, avoiding overt clichés, but character reasoning is overly logical without nuanced emotion; metaphors like "liquid mercury" are fresh yet sparse, and tone shifts slightly with technical focus, hinting at formulaic precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements like "grand designs" woven in, but style occasionally prioritizes complexity over clarity; brief length works as deliberate, yet lacks lingering depth beyond explicit narrative of water discovery.</comment>
