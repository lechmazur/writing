<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Li Wei’s motivation to weave emotional honesty into illusions is clear and drives his actions, but his "rationally impulsive" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes his decisions beyond surface mentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to performance is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the cold-case solving method, while central, lacks detailed grounding in the narrative’s logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Chinese palace and post-oil timeframe are vividly realized with evocative sensory details like “sunlight through debris,” enhancing the anxious serenity tone and supporting Li Wei’s motivation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a lingering sadness and uses symbolism (the doll’s dress as lost innocence) well, but the emotional depth is somewhat told rather than shown, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of blending cold-case solving with performance is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat predictable post-apocalyptic tropes, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than organically shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper resonance.</comment>
