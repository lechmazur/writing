<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation to map abandoned railways and confront his buried guilt is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond grief; the "artfully messy" attribute lacks deeper integration into his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, confession, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the short-circuit action drives tension briefly but isn’t fully tied to the larger narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is evocative with strong sensory details like ozone and static hum, enhancing the mood of loss; however, the hospital monitor timeframe feels detached from the primary setting, weakening atmospheric unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes grief and relief through Elias’s confession, with resonant imagery like the echo as truth; yet, the ending feels slightly overwrought, and subtext about duty and denial isn’t fully explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the radio wave garden and echo-measuring method are unique, emotional expression occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; metaphors like "resonant frequency" are fresh but not consistently sustained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brevity feels intentional; however, the style occasionally overreaches with dense imagery, slightly obscuring clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
