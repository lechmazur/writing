<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to find hidden waterfalls aligns with the smuggler’s guilt and need for redemption, but the irate trait feels underexplored in action or voice, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete with a clear shift from despair to resolve, but pacing is uneven—introspection slows momentum, and the tea-leaf method’s impact on plot feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport setting enhances the tone of desolation and supports Kael’s isolation; sensory details like “cracked permacrete” are evocative, though some atmospheric connections to motivation feel overstated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (waterfalls as absolution) and subtext around guilt create impact, but the ending lacks a sharper emotional punch, and some imagery (steam as ghosts) feels slightly clichéd.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original elements like tea-leaf patterns offer uniqueness, but metaphors occasionally veer into overuse (“stardust” for loss); emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of waterfalls and tea leaves, but overwrought language sometimes obscures clarity; lingering thought is present but not profound.</comment>
