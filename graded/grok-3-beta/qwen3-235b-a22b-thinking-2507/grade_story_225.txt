<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Elara Voss's motivation to protect the Monarchae butterflies is clear and ties to her past exile, but her personality as a "wayward apothecary" lacks depth beyond surface traits; her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a clear conflict and resolution attempt, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the Morse code signals and the butterflies’ infection isn’t fully logical within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details like the groaning hull and bioluminescent algae, enhancing the battered tone, though the timeframe of broken treaties feels underexplored in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara’s desperation, and imagery like the "wounded leviathan" is striking, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the theme of beauty amidst ruin feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of weaponized butterflies is original, some descriptions (e.g., "unjustly fair reality") lean toward purple prose, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the submarine and butterflies, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
