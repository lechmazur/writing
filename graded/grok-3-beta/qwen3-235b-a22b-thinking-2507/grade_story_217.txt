<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena’s portrayal as an underestimated rebel is evident in her actions, but her motivations lack depth beyond the surface desire to preserve the park; her voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the park’s closure as a central conflict, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though the developer’s change of heart is somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like decaying rides and chive scents; atmosphere effectively supports the ephemeral gloom and Lena’s motivation, though timeframe integration feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response and uses symbolism (dumplings as connection), but the ending feels overly optimistic and lacks subtext depth; conflict is present but resolved too neatly within constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some imagery (decaying Ferris wheel) feels familiar; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown; writing style is clear but lacks a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like dumplings and adaptation, but the brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering warmth, though depth beyond the narrative is limited.</comment>
