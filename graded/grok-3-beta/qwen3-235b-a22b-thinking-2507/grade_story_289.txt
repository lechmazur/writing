<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Aris Thorne’s brainy observer trait and motivation to find lost civilizations are clear, but her social awkwardness feels underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond a surface mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between ephemeral art and enforcing memory isn’t fully convincing as a climactic action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay setting is vividly described and enhances the ethereal tone, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on impermanence and memory, with strong symbolism in the doll and art, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by overt telling rather than showing character growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of ephemeral art is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “dissolving like mist”) feel generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
