<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aris’s unique ability to taste memories shapes his introspective journey, and his motivation to sever toxic ties is clear, but his emotional transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven—introspection overshadows action, and the stadium setting’s relevance to the resolution is underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The yodeling valley and stadium settings are evocative with strong sensory details (rain trails, yodels), enhancing mood, though the connection between the two settings feels somewhat tenuous and underexplained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through forgiveness and uses potent imagery (paperclip as apology), but the central conflict’s resolution feels rushed, and subtext, while present, lacks deeper layering for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of memory-tasting is original, some metaphors (e.g., “vinegar on raw nerves”) feel familiar, and emotional expression occasionally leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting resonance.</comment>
