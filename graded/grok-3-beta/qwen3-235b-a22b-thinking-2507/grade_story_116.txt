<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map the endless night is clear and drives action, but the minstrel's personality feels underdeveloped; "dismayed" and "subjectively rational" lack depth in shaping distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness with map creation as resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; connections between polaroids and map-making are logical yet lack deeper causal impact within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the sky-lounge and endless city is vivid with strong sensory details like jasmine scent and neon; setting enhances mood, though garden secrets timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected from action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection through the map as a metaphor for capturing fleeting moments; imagery is strong, but emotional depth is surface-level, relying more on stated feelings than nuanced showing; ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with poetic metaphors, but some imagery (e.g., "velvet void") feels slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuance; narrative avoids clich√©s yet follows a predictable introspective artist trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like polaroids and broken watch band; style supports clarity, but depth is limited by brevity; leaves a lingering thought about time and memory, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
