<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but the "unseen observer" lacks depth or distinct voice, feeling more like a plot device than a fleshed-out entity; "aggressively kind" is intriguing but underdeveloped in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning (whale’s call), middle (flinging the whistle), and end (tradition rescued), but pacing feels rushed; connections between dancer, whale, and whistle are imaginative yet strain coherence at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse watch room sets a compelling mood, enhanced by sensory details like "salt-encrusted window" and "storm-lashed sea"; atmosphere supports the tone, but connection to dancer’s stage feels forced and less immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story evokes a sense of mystery and deeper meaning through symbolism (whistle as beacon of tradition), but emotional impact is muted by abstract language; ending is purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch; theme of continuity emerges but isn’t fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in linking whale calls to human artistry, but metaphors like "cosmic threads" feel overused; tone is consistent, yet emotional resonance relies on stated concepts rather than nuanced showing; writing borders on purple prose at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced; style is ambitious but occasionally obscures clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; leaves a lingering idea of tradition, but impact is inconsistent.</comment>
