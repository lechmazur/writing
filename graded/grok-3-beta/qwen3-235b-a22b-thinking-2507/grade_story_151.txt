<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Aris’s portrayal as an awed astronomer is clear, but her motivation feels overly cerebral and lacks depth; her reactions to the idol and veil are logical but emotionally hollow, missing nuanced personal stakes despite the story’s premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the idol’s destruction as a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between snowflake patterns and action are intriguing yet underexplored within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a striking, cohesive setting that enhances the cold, isolated tone; sensory details like groaning ice are evocative, though some descriptions lack varied textures to fully immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imagery like “shattering stars” and the veil’s symbolism are strong, but the story struggles to evoke deep emotional resonance or subtext; the ending is purposeful but lacks a lingering punch beyond its surface resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a post-emotion world is original, the execution leans on overly precise, logical reasoning and generic descriptors like “crystal shadows”; metaphors are occasionally fresh but not consistently inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it feels constrained by length rather than deliberately concise, missing a deeper lingering impact.</comment>
