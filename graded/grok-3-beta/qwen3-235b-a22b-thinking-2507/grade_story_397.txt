<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Leo's jadedness and past as a surgeon are clear, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; the shift from bartender to seeking cosmic answers lacks depth in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed; the connection between doodles and fate is intriguing yet forced, undermining coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystal lab setting is vividly described and enhances the strange tone, but sensory details are uneven, and the atmosphere only partially supports Leo’s desperate optimism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Leo’s hope, but symbolism (scalpel as redemption) feels heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of doodles as fate is original, the execution relies on overused redemption tropes; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking fresh subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but feels constrained by its elements; creative ideas are present, yet the style and depth fail to leave a lasting impact for top-tier publication.</comment>
