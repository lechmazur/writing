<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map caves is clear, but the "hushed necromancer" trait feels underexplored; losing his voice to spirits is mentioned but lacks depth or impact on actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with mapping as the central action, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional punch within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like light refraction, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone and supporting the character's mission effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes nostalgia and loss through memories of Elara and movies, with some effective symbolism (cap as connection), but subtext is occasionally heavy-handed, and emotional depth could be shown more subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is unique, some metaphors (film rewinding as mapping) feel predictable, and emotional resonance relies too much on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; writing style lacks distinct flair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the cap and movies, but style occasionally overexplains, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
