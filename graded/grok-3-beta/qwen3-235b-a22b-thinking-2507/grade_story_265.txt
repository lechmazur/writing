<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Deputy Aris’s impassivity is well-portrayed and consistent with his cautious bravery, but his motivation to witness pure grace feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper backstory or internal conflict to fully ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a clear arc, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax of witnessing grace, and the connection between the action of stretching and the broader narrative feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lush orchard in the cathedral rafters is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of reverence and supporting Aris’s motivation, though the timeframe of oil changes feels slightly disconnected from the ethereal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through the moment of grace, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the lack of deeper subtext or lingering conflict limits its impact; the theme of resilience is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and concept, some metaphors (e.g., orchard’s “silent song”) feel slightly generic; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but character nuance is constrained by the brevity, risking a formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of quiet awe, but the brief length somewhat hinders depth; style supports clarity, though it occasionally verges on overly ornate description.</comment>
