<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to reunite with courage is clear but underdeveloped; the "loudly introverted" trait feels tacked on without shaping actions or voice distinctly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; meandering as an action drives the story but lacks urgency or deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Neon cathedral and post-human timeframe create a striking atmosphere; vivid sensory details like "jagged emerald shadows" immerse, though setting-object connection could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes quiet emotional resonance with the CD as a symbol of courage, but subtext feels repetitive; ending is purposeful yet lacks a sharper punch or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Imagery like "spectral moss" is fresh, but some metaphors ("phantom thrum") border on clich√©; emotional handling shows nuance, though overall style lacks a fully distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity feels slightly limiting; leaves a subtle lingering thought, yet lacks the depth for immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
