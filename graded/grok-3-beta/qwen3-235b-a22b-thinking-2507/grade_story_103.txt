<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight’s motivation to silence regret over his son’s death is clear and drives his internal conflict, but his personality feels slightly underdeveloped beyond the trope of a haunted warrior; the grudgingly sweet bond with the boy is a highlight, though it lacks deeper nuance in expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning (confinement), middle (dilemma), and end (sacrifice), but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the mirror pattern and escape is logical yet underexplored, weakening cause-effect depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef setting effectively enhances the mood of entrapment and danger, with strong sensory details like “salt-crusted window” and “waves shattering”; however, the atmosphere occasionally over-relies on predictable marine imagery, slightly dulling immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the knight’s sacrifice and the boy’s laughter, with solid imagery like “waves shattered like broken promises”; yet, the central conflict’s resolution feels somewhat predictable, and subtext about duty versus love lacks deeper layering for a truly profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a personal take on sacrifice, some metaphors like “seaweed choking” feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the narrative style lacks a truly distinctive voice, leaning on familiar tragic tones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with the lighthouse and impossible choices driving a unified narrative; however, the style sometimes overcomplicates imagery, hindering clarity, and while the ending lingers emotionally, it doesn’t fully transcend the constraints of its brevity.</comment>
