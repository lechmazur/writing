<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Celeste’s glamorous undertaker persona is intriguing, and her motivation to preserve narratives is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the role; reactions to the brass tape are symbolic yet feel slightly forced, missing a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action of elongating the archive drives the plot, but the story feels incomplete within the word limit, lacking a fully resolved arc; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional beats, though the concept of ordinariness ties to the narrative logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is evocative and complements the tone of jubilant remorse; sensory details like cerulean fumes and flickering fluorescents enhance immersion, though the timeframe of paint mixing feels underutilized in building atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes bittersweet emotion and uses strong imagery (ochre swirling into sunset hues), with subtext about memory and ordinariness; however, the ending feels more repetitive than satisfying, and the conflict remains too abstract for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining digital archives with undertaker traditions, but some metaphors (e.g., “holy relics”) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style occasionally veers into ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the brass tape and social network archive, but the style sometimes obscures clarity with dense symbolism; it leaves a lingering thought about memory, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
