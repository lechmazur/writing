<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Silas’s wry and warmly aloof nature is evident, but his deeper motivations feel underexplored within the word limit, leaving his actions slightly detached from a fully fleshed-out inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but feels rushed at the resolution; the connection between tracking cloud paths and vanishing lacks sufficient grounding, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The space pirate ship cargo hold and nebula setting are vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the mood of isolation, though the integration of the outdated phone’s timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (time as fraying thread) and imagery creates emotional resonance, but the ending’s impact is diminished by a lack of clarity in the central conflict’s resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors are fresh, the narrative occasionally leans on predictable sci-fi tropes about time and isolation without subversion; emotional nuance is present but inconsistently deep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth and leaving some lingering questions unanswered.</comment>
