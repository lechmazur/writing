<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt as a swordswoman is clear and drives her motivation, but her "reservedly bold" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in execution; her distinct voice is muted by descriptive over narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the climax; the connection between petal fall and door opening is contrived, and pacing stumbles with excessive internal reflection within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop and mellow intensity create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like ozone and flickering light; however, the rosebush timeframe feels symbolically forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara’s guilt, and symbolism of the mask is effective, but the ending feels predictable; subtext is present but lacks deeper resonance or a truly memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the narrative follows a familiar redemption arc without significant subversion; sensory details are decent but not uniquely vivid, and emotional handling leans toward stated rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they sometimes overshadow organic storytelling; style supports clarity, yet the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, missing a lingering depth.</comment>
