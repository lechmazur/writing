<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s uptight nature as a scribe is well-portrayed through her precision and rigid posture, but her motivation lacks depth beyond the witch’s directive; the transformation feels slightly abrupt without deeper internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically through the adhesive analysis, but pacing feels uneven with heavy exposition early on; the arc is complete, yet the resolution lacks a stronger emotional punch within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse and gravestone hill setting creates a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone of buried optimism; sensory details like fogged panes and cold flagstones are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional shift and uses symbolism with the bulb effectively; however, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme of empathy, while present, lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a resonator bulb is original, some descriptions (e.g., “arms of steel”) feel clichéd without subversion; emotional handling is shown rather than told, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
