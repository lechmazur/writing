<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a professional cuddler is clear, reflecting a struggle with emotional vulnerability, but her internal conflict feels somewhat repetitive and lacks deeper nuance in action beyond introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, connecting the hangar discovery to personal growth, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between the acceptance speech and hangar revelation lacks seamless causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of decay and isolation, though the link between setting and character motivation occasionally feels overwrought rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on vulnerability with strong symbolism (hangar as isolation), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of connection, while present, lacks a truly surprising or profound resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "cracked riverbeds") feel slightly clich√©d, and emotional resonance relies more on stated introspection than nuanced showing through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the phantom punch, leaving a lingering thought on vulnerability, but overly elaborate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
