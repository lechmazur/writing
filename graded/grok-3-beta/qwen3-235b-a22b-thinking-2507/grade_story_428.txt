<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's transition from city planner to doomsday prepper is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth; they feel stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict. His voice is indistinct, missing a personal edge despite the dramatic shift in identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the handshake. The connection between studying constellations and the temple deal is tenuous, weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is vividly described with sensory details like incense and crumbling sandstone, enhancing the mood of daring caution. However, the linkage between the setting and the ink blotter feels forced, missing a deeper thematic tie.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on paranoia and authenticity, with decent use of symbolism (ink blotter as anxiety). However, the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a visceral punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story attempts originality with broken constellations and the blotterâ€™s symbolic weight, it leans on predictable prepper tropes without subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh but often overextended, and emotional nuance is inconsistent, feeling stated at times.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels somewhat cohesive, with elements like the temple and prepper identity working in service of the narrative. However, the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
