<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mei’s motivation to restore traditional practices is clear and aligns with her role as a cryptic fortune writer, but her personality lacks depth beyond this purpose; her reactions to the tile and revelations feel predictable rather than revealing unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from seeking the oracle to discovering Chen is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the kink in the shadow as a plot device is intriguing yet underexplored, leaving cause-effect relationships slightly vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope studio and pre-dawn timeframe create a vivid, whimsical atmosphere that supports the tone and motivation; sensory details like frosted glass and fractured light are evocative, though deeper integration of setting with action is lacking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Mei’s duty of renewal, with strong symbolism in the chipped tile; however, the ending feels slightly pat, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow; subtext about communal hope is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining fortune-writing with oracle traditions, but some metaphors (e.g., “forgotten stars”) feel overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet the overall style lacks a distinct authorial voice, risking generic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of hope, but not with exceptional depth.</comment>
