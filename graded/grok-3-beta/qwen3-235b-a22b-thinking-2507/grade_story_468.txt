<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of imitating the spiritsâ€™ song driving progression, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and causality is occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and timeframe of night-to-dawn are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details (brine, decay, golden embers), enhancing the atmosphere; tone aligns well with the concept, though object connection to setting feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of singing spirits and dream journals offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar mystical tropes without subversion; sensory details are specific but occasionally generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
