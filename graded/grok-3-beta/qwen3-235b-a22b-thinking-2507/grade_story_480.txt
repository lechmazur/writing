<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to seek raw, unfiltered reality is clear and consistent, driving his actions as a social media exorcist, but his personality lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice beyond the concept; his reactions and observations feel somewhat surface-level for a character in a top-tier literary piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, and the action of reigniting connection drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and coherence is occasionally disrupted by overemphasis on symbolic elements like receipts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall timeframe create a haunting atmosphere that complements the concept of familiar strangers; sensory details like plaster dust and warped violin notes are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response about digital versus real connection, with effective use of symbolism (receipts as relics), but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by limited character depth; the ending feels purposeful, yet dialogue and subtext could be sharper for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist offers originality, and metaphors like receipts as prayer flags are fresh, but some sensory details feel generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; the narrative avoids major clichés but lacks a fully distinctive style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story coheres around its assigned elements with creative integration, leaving a lingering thought about connection, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength; it shows promise but isn’t yet at a publishable elite level.</comment>
