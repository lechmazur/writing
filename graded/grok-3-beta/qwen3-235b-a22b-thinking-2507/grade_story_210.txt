<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s amiability is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams is clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth or distinct voice to fully humanize him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of navigating shadows driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like funding irrelevance, are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly realized with strong sensory details like salt-bleached wood and vibrating timbers, enhancing atmosphere and supporting the concept, though the timeframe metaphor feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on past and future harmony, with effective imagery like the lighthouse beam weaving light; however, the ending feels slightly pat, and subtext lacks deeper complexity for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of navigating shadows is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., “damp cobwebs”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated outcomes than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like vibrating timbers, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity exposes underdeveloped emotional stakes, limiting lasting impact.</comment>
