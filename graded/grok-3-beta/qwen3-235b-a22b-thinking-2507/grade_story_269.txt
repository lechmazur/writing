<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s nostalgia as a tailor is well-integrated into his motivation to ascend, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single trait; reactions to the mirror feel predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the mirror’s revelation driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like ozone and steam; however, the setting’s connection to parallel lives feels under-explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of longing through imagery and subtext, and the ending is purposeful, but the central conflict lacks sharp tension, and some metaphors feel overextended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel lives offers originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of mirrored selves without significant subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic, though the tone is consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the mirror and confessions, leaving a lingering sense of transcendence, but overly ornate language sometimes obscures clarity.</comment>
