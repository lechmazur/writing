<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation to connect celestial and terrestrial through subtle gestures is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the herbalist archetype; Aiko's unspoken questions are intriguing but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from observation to repositioning to connection feels forced at times, with pacing rushed in the resolution; the meteor shower decoding drives the action but isn't fully integrated logically into the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Japanese castle and art class timeframe create a vivid, immersive backdrop with evocative cherry blossoms and ink-wash studios; sensory details are strong, though the tone of distant intimacy occasionally overpowers the setting's potential for warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its celestial-botanical metaphor, with strong imagery like "pollen on still water," but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper conflict; the theme of connection is clear but not fully layered within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of meteor showers guiding herbal actions is original, the writing leans on ornate phrases like "ephemeral fire" that border on purple prose; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
