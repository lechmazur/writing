<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to preserve fading traditions is clear, but her spiritually secular attribute feels underexplored, lacking depth in shaping her actions or voice. Her reaction to the coat button carries emotional weight, yet her personality remains somewhat generic, missing a distinct edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of obliterating the data-worm driving tension. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the coffee stain method, while intriguing, lacks logical grounding, slightly disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport baggage claim is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the tone of fractal sorrow. The setting supports Elara’s motivation well, though the connection between the coat button and setting feels tenuous, missing a stronger tie-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elara’s dilemma and uses strong imagery like fractal sorrow. The ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and while subtext exists, it’s not deeply layered. Conflict is clear, but emotional resonance relies partly on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers some originality with the flying library and coffee stain divination, but metaphors like “starlight in a polluted sky” feel overused. Emotional handling shows nuance in places, yet occasionally states feelings directly, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable sacrificial arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with most elements serving the narrative, though the coffee stain method feels forced. The brief length works, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing. It leaves a lingering sadness, yet lacks profound depth for top-tier impact.</comment>
