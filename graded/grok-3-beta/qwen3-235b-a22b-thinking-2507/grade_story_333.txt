<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s portrayal as a sincere rebel is clear, and her motivation to preserve traditions aligns with her actions, but her character lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice beyond the surface-level defiance and determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between theorizing and the building’s response is not fully logical or convincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like damp stone and thunder, though the setting’s connection to the object (sticky note) feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara’s struggle and uses symbolism (building as anxiety), but the impact is diminished by occasional telling over showing and a resolution that feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a building reflecting fear is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar gothic tropes without significant subversion, and some metaphors (e.g., “braided bitterness”) feel overwrought and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought of resilience, though the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
