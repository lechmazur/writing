<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve art techniques is clear and consistent, but the "reserved oracle" lacks depth in personality beyond dedication; reactions to scrawls and cuffs feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with mending driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—discovery and repair overshadow emotional resolution; coherence is maintained but lacks sharp tension within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (sighs of birds, choir vibrations), enhancing atmosphere and action; tone of poignant levity complements setting effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on art's survival, with strong imagery (dust motes, divine annotation); ending is satisfying, but subtext feels slightly heavy-handed, and conflict remains understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original setting and concept avoid clichés, with fresh metaphors (altar of echoes); however, emotional nuance is more stated than shown, and style occasionally veers into ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought on preservation; style is clear but sometimes overwrought, and brevity feels slightly constraining rather than deliberate.</comment>
