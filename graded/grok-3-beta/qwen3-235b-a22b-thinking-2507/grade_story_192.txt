<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear and drives her actions, but her personality as an "eager lookout" feels underexplored, lacking a distinct voice or deeper nuance in her reactions to the poltergeist activity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and the connection between digital anxiety and poltergeist activity, while creative, lacks fully logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Roman villa reimagined as a digital detox center is vividly rendered with sensory details like beeswax scent and marble floors, enhancing the atmosphere, though the timeframe "throughout cleaning" feels incidental rather than integral to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about digital disconnection and has strong symbolism with the sewing box, but the emotional impact is uneven due to limited depth in secondary characters and dialogue that, while purposeful, lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of digital poltergeists is original, the narrative occasionally leans on predictable themes of technology vs. humanity without fully subverting them, and some metaphors, like "hollow pings," feel slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the sewing box and digital anxiety, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
