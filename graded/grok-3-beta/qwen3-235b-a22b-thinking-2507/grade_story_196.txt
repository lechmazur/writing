<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation to find his sister and his fierce apathy are clear, but the shift from apathy to action feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance to fully flesh out his character within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from resignation to renewed purpose is coherent with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the transition to action; the connection between meteors and overcoming weariness isn’t fully justified logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery and quiet breakroom setting enhance the isolating atmosphere effectively, with vivid imagery like dust motes and meteors, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Kael’s quiet defiance, with strong metaphors like the meteor spark, but the ending feels more symbolic than satisfying, and the conflict’s resolution lacks depth due to brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of following meteors is unique, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of weary warriors finding purpose without significant subversion; metaphors are fresh but emotions are sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like meteors as a guide, leaving a lingering sense of quiet determination, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
