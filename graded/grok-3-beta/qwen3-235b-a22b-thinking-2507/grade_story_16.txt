<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by the action of outwitting the turbine malfunction, with a clear arc from problem to resolution within the word limit.

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steampunk airship engine room is vividly realized with sensory details like hissing pistons and clanking gears, enhancing the atmosphere of tension and repair.

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Hemlock’s confession and Elara’s realization, with strong symbolism in the amber ring. The ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels slightly stiff.
