<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo’s portrayal as an apologetic thug is intriguing, with his motivation to learn resilience clear and consistent, but his internal conflict lacks deeper nuance; the dialogue, though steady, feels somewhat rehearsed rather than raw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of outlasting driving tension, but pacing feels uneven—key emotional beats are rushed, and the connection between museum meetings and the garden climax isn’t fully seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the volatile atmosphere and mirroring Milo’s turmoil, though its connection to the crate slat feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through resilience as a theme, with effective symbolism in the slat, but the ending lacks a sharper punch; subtext is present but not as layered as it could be.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in the garden setting, metaphors like “storm within” feel familiar, and emotional handling occasionally leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but uneven pacing and surface-level emotional depth prevent it from reaching the highest literary standard.</comment>
