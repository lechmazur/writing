<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elara's "fading caretaker" role and motivation to cradle the unknown are intriguing, but her emotional transformation feels surface-level and lacks a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from apathy to wonder, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between hacking and the gorge’s discovery is underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details (salt, lavender, damp stone), effectively enhancing the tone of enthusiastic apathy and the allure of the forbidden; minor disconnect between caravan station and gorge transition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes wonder through sensory logs and imagery, with a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext or conflict beyond Elara’s internal shift; theme of craving the unknown is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of sensory data and the gorge as a cathedral, but metaphors like "newborn galaxy" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown but not nuanced enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally leans toward ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; leaves a lingering feeling of wonder, though not profoundly memorable.</comment>
