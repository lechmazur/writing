<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The aloof orphan’s detachment is evident, but his emotional shift from fear to courage feels somewhat abrupt and lacks deeper introspection. Motivation is clear, yet his distinct voice is underdeveloped in the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit. The gravitational anomaly drives the story, but its resolution lacks grounding in cause and effect. Pacing is uneven, with the ending feeling slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as a setting is intriguing and ties to the tone of detachment, but sensory details are sparse. Atmosphere supports the concept of adaptation, though the garage lacks vivid, immersive description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the theme of resilience, with effective symbolism in the stones. However, the ending is only moderately satisfying, and the conflict’s resolution feels more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the metaphors (e.g., stones as constellations) are not entirely fresh. Emotional nuance is present but often explicitly stated rather than shown. Originality is moderate but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language. The brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, though a lingering theme of adaptation remains.</comment>
