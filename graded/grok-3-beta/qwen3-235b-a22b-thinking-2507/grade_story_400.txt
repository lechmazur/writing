<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glacial orchard and post-human timeframe create a striking, cohesive atmosphere, with vivid sensory details like "blue ice" and "frost-berries glowing like captured starlight" enhancing the mood, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
