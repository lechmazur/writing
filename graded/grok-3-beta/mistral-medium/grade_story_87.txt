<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to bury hatred is clear, and the librarian's patience is implied through deliberate actions, but the personality lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions to the sticker sheet feel symbolic yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within constraints, with a subtle resolution, but pacing is uneven—introspection overshadows action, and cause-effect links between memory and present action are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Steampunk dining hall is vividly described with sensory details (whirring gears, hissing pipes), enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the character's motivation and the sticker sheet feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (sticker as reclaiming self) add depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by over-telling; conflict is present but lacks sharp tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending steampunk with personal reckoning, but metaphors like "ghost of what she’d lost" are generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
