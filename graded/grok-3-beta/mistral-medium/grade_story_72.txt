<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between actions and the concept of "paper trails" are vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the domed vineyard on an alien plain is evocative with strong sensory details, enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe's integration feels abstract and disconnected from the mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in imagery and setting, but metaphors like "sky bled starlight" feel overused; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward overwriting, hindering clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
