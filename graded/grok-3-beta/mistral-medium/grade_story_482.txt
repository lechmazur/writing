<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the Mayor’s portrait as the central conflict, but pacing feels rushed toward the end; cause and effect are logical, though the resolution lacks a deeper punch within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop among giant mushrooms is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like bioluminescent fungi and damp earth; it supports the tone, though the classroom timeframe feels underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
