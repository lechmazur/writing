<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena’s portrayal as a "smiling saboteur" is intriguing, but her motivation to channel a star’s wrath feels vague and underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional grounding or backstory within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the connection between Lena’s actions and the star’s wrath feels forced; pacing is uneven, with the climax rushed and lacking clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the tone of "angry peace," though the setting’s connection to the mannequins and star feels somewhat tangential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story employs strong imagery and metaphor (e.g., "constellation of cracks"), evoking some emotional response, but the central conflict is murky, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable decay-and-rebellion tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the style lacks distinct individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is competent but not striking, and the short length exposes gaps in depth rather than feeling deliberate.</comment>
