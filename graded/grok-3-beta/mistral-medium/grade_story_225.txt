<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation to track butterflies as a form of redemption is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this obsession; the “wayward apothecary” trait feels underexplored, and his voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of infecting butterflies driving a quiet narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on imagery, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like hissing pipes, enhancing the battered marvel tone, but the connection between setting and butterflies feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic mood and uses symbolism (butterflies as hope), but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of tracking butterflies with Morse code is original, the prose occasionally leans on generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats, lacking nuanced subtext or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the short length feels deliberate, but the style lacks the polish for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought, yet not a profound one.</comment>
