<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena’s profession as a cuddler and her prejudice against touch provide a compelling backstory, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and her transformation somewhat abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the speech as a climax, but the connection between the ticket punch and the resolution feels tenuous, and pacing suffers from an overly introspective middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar sets an evocative tone of decay, and sensory details like rusted beams are effective, but the farmer’s market feels incongruous with the setting, diluting atmospheric coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with Lena’s shift in perspective, and symbolism of the punch is intriguing, but the theme of connection feels underexplored, and dialogue lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a cuddler and ghostly object shows originality, some metaphors (e.g., “eyes like faded stars”) feel clichéd, and emotional expression occasionally leans on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but their integration often feels forced; the brevity limits depth, and the lingering impact is muted by underdeveloped themes.</comment>
