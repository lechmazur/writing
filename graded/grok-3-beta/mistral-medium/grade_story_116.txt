<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the minstrel's dismay is stated but lacks depth in action or internal conflict. Motivation to map the endless night feels abstract and disconnected from a distinct personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a thematic arc of seeking understanding, the narrative lacks a clear beginning-middle-end progression within the word limit, feeling more like a meditation than a story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sky-lounge and endless city create a vivid, surreal atmosphere with strong sensory imagery, but the integration of garden secrets feels vague and underutilized in enhancing mood or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has evocative imagery and symbolism (broken watch band, photographs), but the emotional impact is muted by over-reliance on abstraction rather than showing nuanced emotion or conflict; the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by repetitive metaphors (petals, boundaries) and overly ornate language that borders on purple prose; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is moderate; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced or overly symbolic, and the style prioritizes flourish over clarity, limiting the story’s lingering impact.</comment>
