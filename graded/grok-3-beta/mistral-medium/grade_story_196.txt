<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the spark of defiance driving the swordsman’s actions, but the fiercely apathetic attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between meteors and overcoming duty is somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, complemented by evocative meteor imagery; however, sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery like meteors as a path is striking, and there’s a central conflict of duty versus defiance, but emotional impact is diminished by telling over showing, and the ending feels more abrupt than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh take on defiance through the meteor motif, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., spark to fire) are predictable, and emotional depth lacks nuanced subtext, feeling somewhat stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but overall impact is hindered by uneven emotional resonance and a lack of lingering depth or question.</comment>
