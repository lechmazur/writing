<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between returning the wallet and deeper emotional resolution is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The beekeeper’s sanctuary is vividly rendered with sensory details like honey scent and bee hums, enhancing the atmosphere, though the timeframe of the band stopping feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through the paper plane symbolism, but the impact is diluted by overly explicit emotional exposition rather than nuanced showing; the ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the story leans on predictable tropes of emotional healing without subversion, and certain metaphors feel generic rather than unique to the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
