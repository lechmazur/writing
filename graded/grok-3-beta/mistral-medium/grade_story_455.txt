<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is present but shallow; the attendant’s disgruntlement and relaxation are noted, but motivations remain vague and reactions to the coins lack depth. Distinct voice is missing in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is incomplete; the arc feels unresolved despite the word limit. Pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are murky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong imagery of moonlight and shadows, enhancing mood, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual cues, and the setting’s connection to action feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic scars and coins, but emotional resonance is limited by overt telling rather than showing. Dialogue is functional but not memorable; subtext is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors (e.g., ghosts, scars) without subversion; writing style feels occasionally ornate with generic descriptors. Emotional handling lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced rather than organic. Style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
