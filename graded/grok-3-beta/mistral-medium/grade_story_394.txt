<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as "aimlessly passionate" is intriguing but underdeveloped; the archer’s drive lacks depth beyond vague longing, and her distinct voice is absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels forced by the word limit; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution, and connections between elements like the bent fork and legacy are unclear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the subterranean colosseum is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery (paper airplane, bent fork) carries symbolic weight, but emotional resonance is shallow, and the central conflict feels underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story leans on familiar quest tropes without subversion; metaphors like the airplane feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is attempted but strained by forced integration of elements; the brief length feels limiting, and the lingering impact is minimal due to underdeveloped themes.</comment>
