<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exiled prince's motivation to cure loneliness is clear and drives his interaction with the mortar and pestle, but his personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of a burdened outcast; his voice, while evocative, does not fully stand out as unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing is uneven within the word limit, with rushed emotional shifts; the connection between grinding the past and personal revelation feels forced at times, lacking tighter cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and sudden snowstorm create a strong, immersive atmosphere of isolation that complements the tone of the familiar unknown; sensory details like the storm’s howl are effective, though some connections between setting and action feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective emotional response and employs symbolism (mortar as past, reflection as self) effectively; however, the central conflict feels understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch to fully satisfy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a fresh take on exile and loneliness, some metaphors (storm as emotional weight) are predictable; emotional nuance is present but often explicitly stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a distinctly personal flair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels intentional, leaving a lingering thought about loneliness; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
