<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes of light vs. darkness without subversion; metaphors like "darkness slithered" are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but lacks depth or lingering impact; style is functional but not distinctive, and brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
