<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The leaf classification office and cosmic blink create a surreal atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to nonviolence feels underdeveloped despite strong tonal bitterness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes reflection through nonviolence as a theme, with potent symbolism in the mask and marble, but the emotional impact is diluted by overly abstract language and a lack of concrete conflict resolution.</comment>
