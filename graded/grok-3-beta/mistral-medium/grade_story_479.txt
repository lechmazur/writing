<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Madame Liora's glamour and undertaker role are intriguing, but her motivation to preserve ancient practices feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit; her distinct voice is present but lacks deeper nuance in reaction to challenges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the act of painting as a resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between beginning and end is clear yet lacks a stronger causal thread to elevate coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is evocative and enhances the theme of forgotten stories, with ghostly screen flickers adding atmosphere; however, sensory details are sparse beyond visual cues, limiting immersion.</comment>
