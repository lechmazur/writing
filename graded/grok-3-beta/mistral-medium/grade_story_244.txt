<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyssa’s guilt as a swordswoman is evident, but her inner conflict lacks depth due to minimal backstory or specific emotional nuance; her motivation feels surface-level and lacks a distinct voice in her actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the pursuit of the door driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a fully satisfying causal link to the beginning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop creates a unique, moody atmosphere with flickering lights, complementing the mellow intensity, and sensory details like the hum of the shop enhance immersion, though connections between setting and mask feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Lyssa’s reckoning, and symbolism with the mask and door adds subtext, but the dialogue feels cryptic without purpose, and the central conflict resolves too quickly to feel fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique setting, some metaphors (e.g., petals as forgotten promises) feel generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated guilt rather than nuanced showing; tone remains consistent but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, with creative intent evident in the setting and concept, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped emotional depth.</comment>
