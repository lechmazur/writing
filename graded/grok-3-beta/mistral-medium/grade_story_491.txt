<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is ambitious but uneven; connections between beginning and end exist, but pacing feels rushed and coherence is strained by abstract elements within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor and concept, but writing leans toward purple prose with overly ornate language; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in combining elements, but cohesion suffers from stylistic overreach; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice, leaving depth underdeveloped.</comment>
