<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cyber-templar’s motivation to confront reality is hinted at, but his personality lacks depth beyond the assigned “patiently frantic” attribute; reactions to the bridle feel symbolic but not revealing of nuanced character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; the action of proving worth through refracting light drives the story, yet cause-effect links are vague and coherence is strained by overpacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a vivid atmosphere, with sensory details like howling wind and lightning enhancing mood; however, the setting’s connection to the bridle feels tenuous, and the tone of euphoric agitation overshadows subtler atmospheric potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional impact and uses symbolism (prism, storm), but the impact is dulled by overwriting; the ending feels purposeful yet predictable, and tension is present but not sharply defined within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the narrative leans on genre tropes of a lone warrior facing a cosmic test without subversion; metaphors like “prism” and “storm” feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often obscures clarity with dense imagery; the brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and lingering impact is minimal due to underdeveloped depth.</comment>
