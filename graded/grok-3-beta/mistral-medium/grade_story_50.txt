<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as an unconvinced missionary is clear, but depth is lacking; internal conflict feels surface-level and reactions to the fork and faith are predictable, missing nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution, and the connection between seeking magic and the fork’s purpose lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass desert and butterfly migration create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like crunching shards, but the setting’s connection to the fork and motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (fork, butterfly) evoke thought, but emotional impact is muted; the ending is purposeful yet lacks resonance, and the theme of transformed faith feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat unique, metaphors like “fragile hope” feel overused; emotional handling is more told than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on generic descriptors, lacking distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; creative thinking is present but not fully realized, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
