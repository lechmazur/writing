<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elias’s loyalty as a scout is mentioned but not demonstrated through actions or backstory, and his motivation for meditation feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his storm-tracking past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc within the tight word limit; the shift from chaos to clarity feels abrupt, and the pacing is uneven with excessive focus on symbolic elements over narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create an evocative atmosphere of dread, but sensory details are repetitive (moths and storm imagery dominate), and the setting’s connection to meditation feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism (moths, journal code), but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of Elias’s transformation rather than showing nuanced reactions; the ending feels more confusing than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in metaphor (moths as coded nonsense), but relies on overused storm imagery and lacks distinct style; emotional resonance feels stated rather than earned, with generic descriptors undermining authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
