<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's hopeful and cleverly naive nature shapes his belief in redemption, but his inner depth and voice remain underdeveloped, lacking distinct personal conflict or nuanced reactions beyond the mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the action of neutralizing the machine driving the narrative, though pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than causal, slightly weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard and streetlamp timeframe create a haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details like apples and rust, enhancing the tone of agonizing bliss, though the settingâ€™s influence on action feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
