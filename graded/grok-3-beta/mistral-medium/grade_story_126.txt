<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to shatter the illusion is clear, but development feels surface-level; the "honestly strange" trait lacks depth in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, undermining the impact of ascending through illusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Space station setting and post-tree timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like flaking poster edges, though connections to the butter churn feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism with the poster and illusion, evoking reflection on truth, but emotional resonance is limited by overt telling over showing; ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but reliance on predictable "gilded cage" metaphors and stated emotions rather than nuanced subtext dulls uniqueness; tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion despite constraints, with creative element integration, but lacks the depth and polish for a top-tier lingering impact; style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
