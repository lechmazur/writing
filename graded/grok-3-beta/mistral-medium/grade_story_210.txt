<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams is clear, but the amiable nature feels underdeveloped and doesn't distinctly shape actions or voice; reactions to the crossword are intriguing but lack depth in revealing personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc from puzzle-solving to revelation feels complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven with overly dense middle sections; logical flow is maintained, though the connection between action (vibration) and resolution feels forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like creaking timbers and flickering light, enhancing atmosphere and supporting motivation; however, timeframe integration with "waiting room" feels vague and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild curiosity with symbolic use of crossword as a bridge, but emotional resonance is shallow; ending is purposeful yet predictable, lacking deeper subtext or a compelling central conflict within the tight scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in metaphor (crossword as bridge), but leans on repetitive phrases like "doubly singular" and generic shadows; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative, but style often overcomplicates clarity with ornate language; length feels deliberate, yet lacks lingering depth or a truly striking thought beyond the explicit.</comment>
