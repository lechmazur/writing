<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of seeking liberation is clear, but Liam’s personality as an elevator repair technician feels underdeveloped and disconnected from his ghost-seeing ability; his "elegantly clumsy" trait is mentioned but not deeply explored in actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the ghost’s sudden appearance and departure; the action of dissecting ghost stories is logical but underutilized in driving tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is vividly rendered and complements the theme of fragility, with sensory details like sterile air and whispers enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of lunch breaks feels incidental and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a quiet emotional response through imagery of crumbling petals and sand castles, with symbolism around impermanence; yet, dialogue is minimal and lacks depth, and the central conflict resolves too abruptly for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in metaphor (ghosts as stubborn glue), but relies on predictable tropes of ghostly encounters without subversion; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brevity feels deliberate; however, style occasionally leans into overly ornate language, and while it leaves a lingering feeling of acceptance, it lacks deeper questioning or innovation.</comment>
