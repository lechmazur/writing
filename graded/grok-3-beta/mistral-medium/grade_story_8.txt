<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the noble's "dazed" state and rebellious nature are stated but not deeply explored through nuanced actions or internal conflict, limiting depth and distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; while the act of chalking messages drives the narrative, the story feels repetitive and incomplete, missing a clear progression or turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sound garden setting is evocative with strong sensory details like chimes, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the nobleâ€™s motivation and the timeframe feels underdeveloped and incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with imagery like "cosmic dances," but the emotional resonance and central conflict are undercut by repetitive themes and a lack of deeper subtext or satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors like "cracks in the world" and a lack of nuanced emotion; the narrative feels somewhat formulaic, with stated feelings rather than shown complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is moderate; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced, and the style leans toward ornate over clarity, with limited lingering impact or depth beyond the surface rebellion.</comment>
