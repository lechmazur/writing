<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to step out of the father’s shadow is clear, but the wreck-diver ghost whisperer persona feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in how it shapes actions or voice beyond surface-level mentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the act of rebellion drives the story, yet causal connections between events are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery is vividly evoked with sensory details, enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting the character’s emotional journey; however, the timeframe connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a subtle emotional response through symbolism (amber, insect), and the ending feels purposeful; yet, the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the theme of breaking free, while present, isn’t deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the ghost whisperer’s rebellion and use of amber as a metaphor, but reliance on familiar tropes of haunted pasts and ruins without subversion, paired with occasionally generic descriptors, dims uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the carnival and amber, leaving a lingering sense of release; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
