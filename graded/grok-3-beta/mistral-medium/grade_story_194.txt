<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliasâ€™s motivation to learn healing traditions is clear, but his "gracefully awkward" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between bike rides and decoding the letter lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is evocative with strong sensory details like "bone dust" and "aged wine," enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to bike rides and the timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (bones singing, nightmares as guides) add impact, but emotional resonance is uneven due to telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable war-as-lie tropes without subversion; emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating feelings rather than showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
