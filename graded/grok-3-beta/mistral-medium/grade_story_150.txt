<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to spark curiosity is clear, but the outlaw cowboy poet's personality feels underdeveloped beyond archetypal traits; reactions to the dice and walls lack depth in revealing inner conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of misaligning fates driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between dice and wall text shifts are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome and coffee shop walls create a vivid, unique atmosphere with strong sensory details like oil and old paper, enhancing the tone of ambivalence; setting supports motivation well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through the reunion, with decent symbolism in the dice and walls, but subtext is shallow, and the ending feels predictable rather than deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows ingenuity in blending steampunk and fate, metaphors like "walls writing" are somewhat generic; emotional handling leans on stating rather than showing, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering question about fate, though depth remains surface-level.</comment>
