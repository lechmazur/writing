<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s aloofness as an orphan is evident, and his motivation to transform fear into courage is clear, but his emotional depth remains surface-level, lacking nuanced internal conflict or a distinct voice to elevate the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the anomaly and message driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the stones and transformation are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly in the garage creates a compelling, surreal atmosphere, and sensory details like the humming stones enhance mood, but the setting’s integration with character motivation feels somewhat forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias’s shift from fear to resolve, with decent use of symbolism (stones as burdens), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of stones as emotional anchors is somewhat original, metaphors like “tomb of stagnation” and “womb of possibility” feel overused and slightly ornate, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with florid language, and the lingering impact is muted by a lack of profound depth.</comment>
