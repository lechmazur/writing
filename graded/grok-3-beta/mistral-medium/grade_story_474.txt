<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is inconsistent; Elias's ability to hear the dead is intriguing but underexplored in shaping his actions beyond a generic burden. Motivation to outrun a nightmare feels vague and lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; while there is a discernible arc, the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between rebellion and personal struggle is underdeveloped. Cause and effect are logical but lack impact within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows create a vivid atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery. The setting supports the tone but isn't fully integrated with character motivation or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolism like the chessboard, but emotional resonance is shallow due to telling over showing. The ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying; subtext is present but not layered enough.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by generic metaphors and predictable resolution. Emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating feelings rather than showing them. Some imagery feels formulaic, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired. Assigned elements are integrated but feel forced at times, and the style lacks distinct clarity or depth. It leaves little lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
