<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn forgotten languages is clear, but the "timidly loud" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed and does not deeply shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between storm chasing and buttons is tenuous, impacting coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in pairing buttons with languages, but metaphors like “dance of words” are overused, and emotional portrayal leans toward telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like buttons and storms, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and depth beyond the narrative is moderate at best.</comment>
