<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is evident through the mercenary's longing to resolve his past, tied to his brother’s memory, but the "shaky" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the door’s appearance, and the connection between rumor chains and the outcome lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like dust and fading light, enhancing the atmosphere of longing and decay, though the timeframe’s “echoing hour” feels more poetic than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (spider, amber) create subtext about entrapment and release, but emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition of the mercenary’s realization, reducing the “show, don’t tell” effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the spider and mural imagery offers fresh metaphors, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of rewriting the past without significant subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements woven in purposefully, and the brevity feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
