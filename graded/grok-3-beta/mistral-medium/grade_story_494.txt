<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the swordsman’s internal conflict between arrogance and doubt, but his transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation; his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are clear, yet the action of authorizing lacks sufficient buildup to feel impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and atmosphere are evocatively described with sensory details like fading light and brittle reeds, enhancing the mood of harsh tenderness, but the connection between setting and object feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with effective imagery (e.g., shackled potential), but the emotional resonance is undermined by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is adequate with assigned elements integrated into the narrative, but the story feels constrained by its length rather than deliberately concise; lacks a lingering depth or truly creative synthesis of elements.</comment>
