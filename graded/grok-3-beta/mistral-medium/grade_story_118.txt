<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character of the hive-mind therapist lacks depth; motivation to anchor the ephemeral feels vague and underexplored, failing to drive actions with clarity or reveal nuanced personality through dialogue or reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the action of draining minds is present but lacks clear causality or resolution within the tight word limit, resulting in an incomplete arc and rushed pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like ozone and wax, effectively supporting the peculiar tone and setting, though the connection between the secret agent facility and the therapistâ€™s actions feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling shows promise with symbolic wax imagery and subtext of impermanence, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors (wax as minds) and a lack of fresh emotional nuance; writing feels ornate at times, veering into purple prose, diminishing authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall cohesion suffers from forced integration of elements; style is occasionally compelling but overly complex, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
