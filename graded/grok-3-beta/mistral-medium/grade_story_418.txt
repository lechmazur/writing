<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyssa’s headstrong nature and merry bitterness are evident, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; the confession’s emotional depth lacks grounding in prior actions or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the confession driving transformation, but pacing feels rushed at key emotional beats, and the connection between beginning and end is more symbolic than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms create a vivid, contrasting backdrop that enhances the theme of color returning; sensory details are strong, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lyssa’s revelation, with effective symbolism in the stained glass box, but the ending feels slightly pat, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of personal truth transforming a world is fresh, some imagery (e.g., “living storm”) feels familiar, and emotional handling occasionally leans on explicit statement over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length exposes thin character depth; it leaves a lingering feeling of hope, though not profound depth.</comment>
