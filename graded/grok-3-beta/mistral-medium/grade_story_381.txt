<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters Elias and Lira lack depth; their motivations are stated but not deeply explored or nuanced. The necromancer trait feels underutilized in shaping personality, and dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax. Cause and effect are logical, though the action of dominating the cave lacks specificity in execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing atmosphere. However, the futuristic timeframe feels tacked on and underintegrated with the setting's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks significant emotional impact or subtext; imagery is present but not striking. Dialogue is functional but not memorable. Conflict is clear but resolved too neatly without lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable necromancer tropes. Emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown. Some imagery is fresh, but overall style lacks a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but integration is surface-level. Style is clear but unremarkable. Length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and depth is limited.</comment>
