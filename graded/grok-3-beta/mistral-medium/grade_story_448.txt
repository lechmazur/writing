<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's distrustful nature and rebellious docility are present but underdeveloped; motivation to rewrite the guild's legacy feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional stakes or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the candlestick driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between visions and guild transformation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chimney sweep guild hall setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of nostalgic innovation; sensory details like soot and brass are effective, though underutilized for deeper atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has potential for emotional resonance and uses symbolism (candlestick as promise), but it leans on telling over showing, with limited subtext and a resolution that feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of unknown histories offers originality, the narrative relies on familiar mage-rebel tropes without subversion; language is occasionally ornate, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style borders on overwrought, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks depth.</comment>
