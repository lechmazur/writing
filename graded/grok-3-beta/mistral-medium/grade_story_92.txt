<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and unresolved tension at the end, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the action of justifying presence is underdeveloped in driving the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout, with evocative sensory details like the scent of rust and old roses enhancing the haunted mansion setting; tone of loud silence powerfully supports the mood and concept.</comment>
