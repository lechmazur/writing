<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to break free is clear and tied to the tense bodyguard persona, but development feels surface-level; lacks deeper emotional nuance or distinct voice to elevate the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the escape plan's execution lacks detailed logic, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the lunar greenhouse is vivid and enhances the theme of growth versus control; sensory details are effective, though atmosphere could further amplify the protagonist’s inner conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of freedom, with some effective imagery (vines, Earth’s glow), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending feels purposeful yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with some fresh metaphors, but relies on familiar sci-fi tropes of corporate control without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than deeply shown, limiting originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but brevity seems to constrain depth; it leaves a lingering thought of freedom, yet lacks the polish for immediate top-tier publication.</comment>
