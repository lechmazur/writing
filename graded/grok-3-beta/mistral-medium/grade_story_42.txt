<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt as a master forger is evident and drives the narrative, but lacks deeper exploration or distinct voice; motivation is clear but feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning, middle, and end within the word limit; pacing is managed, but the skirmish feels underexplored as a plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the cliffside temple with turbines is vivid and enhances the mood; sensory details like wind and sound are effective, though smell and taste are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with imagery and symbolism (pen as guilt), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable impact; ending is satisfying but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in concept, but metaphors like "ink into parchment" feel familiar; emotional nuance is present but not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally leans ornate, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
