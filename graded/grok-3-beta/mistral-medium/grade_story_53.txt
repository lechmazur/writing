<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora's rashness as a protector is evident, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth in execution; her reactions to the postcards reveal longing, yet her distinct voice and nuanced development are missing within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the chance encounter, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between elements like the fortress and postcards lacks clarity, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and howling caverns create a vivid, mystical atmosphere with strong sensory details like moaning caverns and pulsing stars; however, the timeframe of moving day feels underexplored and disconnected from the setting's impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of wonder and uses symbolism effectively with the postcards as celestial keys, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully earned due to underdeveloped conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on cosmic connection, it leans on mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like the cosmos as an embrace feel slightly generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like postcards and the fortress, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
