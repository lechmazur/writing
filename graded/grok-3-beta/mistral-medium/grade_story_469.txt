<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a longing for the past tied to the necklace, but the "logically emotional" trait feels underexplored, lacking depth in internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the countdown driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery and subtext, but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of survival feels surface-level rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in imagery, but reliance on predictable tropes like hidden truths in tunnels and glowing relics undermines uniqueness; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks a lingering impact or depth; style is clear but not distinctive enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
