<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to recover stolen memories is clear, and the midwife’s secretive nature shapes her quiet urgency, but her deeper personality lacks distinctiveness; her voice feels more symbolic than individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc from loss to realization, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between diaries and transcendence is underdeveloped, weakening cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orchard island and maelstrom create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details (herbs, fruit, earth), effectively supporting the dissonant calm tone and enhancing the midwife’s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on memory and growth through potent imagery (vines, ashes), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional depth relies more on metaphor than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "seeds in the dark" are fresh, but the narrative leans on familiar healer-transformation tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is present but lacks raw, human specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of renewal, but overly poetic style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
