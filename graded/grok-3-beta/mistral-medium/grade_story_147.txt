<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's earnest naivety shapes actions, but motivation feels somewhat surface-level; reactions to the letter opener lack deeper personal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connection between wind chime interpretation and surpassing past failures is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are evocative with strong sensory details like the creaking swing; however, the puppet master's workshop feels underutilized in enhancing action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "between rust and gold" are intriguing but overused; emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing; overall style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally obscures clarity; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
