<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a sense of reunion, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and cause-effect relationships are vague, relying heavily on metaphor rather than clear progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is vivid with sensory details like neon glow and holographic waterfalls, enhancing the mood of disconnection, though the connection between setting and cracked tile feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic emotional response with symbolism of the cracked tile, but dialogue feels stilted, and the central conflict of reconnection lacks tension; subtext is present but not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While metaphors like the cracked tile are creative, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of lost love and reunion without fresh subversion; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is evocative yet overwrought at times, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
