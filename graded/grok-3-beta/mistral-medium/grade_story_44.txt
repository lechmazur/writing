<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena’s feistiness and intellectual playfulness are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve ancient methods feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the lamp’s transformation driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between riddles and redemption are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The space debris studio and carnival memories create an intriguing contrast, with decent atmospheric use of light and void, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in blending space and carnival, the execution relies on somewhat predictable redemption tropes, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
