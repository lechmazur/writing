<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to study sacred development is clear, but the faux fortune teller’s personality lacks depth beyond the visions; reactions to the bone flute are evocative but not revelatory of nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at times; the connection between exploring and the manuscript discovery is logical yet lacks deeper causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively eerie with the bone flute’s melody and archive setting, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the city or archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with the extinct language theme, and the flute symbolism is potent, but emotional resonance is shallow; the ending is purposeful yet not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining visions and extinct language, but metaphors like “bridge between past and present” feel overused; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the flute and archive, but style occasionally veers into overwriting; it leaves a lingering idea of revival, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
