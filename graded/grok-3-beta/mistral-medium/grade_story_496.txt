<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a repressed poet with lingering doubts is clear, but the internal conflict lacks depth in execution; reactions to the perfume bottle and ambush feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the ambush providing tension, but pacing feels uneven—key moments like the stranger’s shift are rushed, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overgrown city street is vividly rendered with sensory details like damp earth and ivy, enhancing atmosphere and mirroring the poet’s doubts; tone of knowing naivety complements the setting well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through symbolism of the perfume bottle as a poem’s first line, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of doubts rather than showing; ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending naivety and cosmic ambition, but metaphors like “ink on wet paper” feel overused; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
