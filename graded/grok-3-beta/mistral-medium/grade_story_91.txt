<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's backstory as an escaped lab experiment is intriguing, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a vague desire for redemption; his gentle nature feels inconsistent with the fedora's violent history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is somewhat coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Elias's actions and the storm's transformation is not fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is vividly rendered with sensory details like ozone and old paper, enhancing the mood of quiet revolution; however, the ghost stories timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through imagery of clouds as wings, and the ending is satisfying; yet, it leans on telling over showing with Elias's internal chaos, and the central theme of beauty feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of controlling weather via cloud shadows is unique, some metaphors (bullet holes filled with starlight) feel overwrought, and emotional resonance is diminished by stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the fedora and weather station, but the style occasionally verges on ornate, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks profound depth.</comment>
