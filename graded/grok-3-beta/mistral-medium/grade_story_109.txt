<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric’s cold nature is evident, but his shift to warmth feels abrupt and lacks depth; motivation is present but not fully explored within the word limit, missing nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the action of supporting altars drives the story, though connections between elements sometimes lack clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The setting and timeframe create an intriguing mood, but sensory details are sparse; the secret agent center feels underutilized in enhancing the action, and atmosphere only partially supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through symbolism of the mitten and altars; subtext is present but not deeply layered; the ending is purposeful but not striking, with limited reflection prompted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative leans on predictable knightly transformation tropes without subversion; metaphors like “spark of warmth” feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profound one.</comment>
