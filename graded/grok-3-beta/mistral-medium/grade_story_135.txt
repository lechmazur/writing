<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Elias’s ambition as a brewer feels tangential, and Mara’s loyalty lacks depth in action or dialogue, though their shared peculiar faith is intriguing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between deciphering bruises and finding Mara is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details, though the timeframe’s relevance is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a sense of mystery and uses symbolism effectively with the straw, but emotional resonance is limited by shallow character reactions; the ending feels purposeful yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., “graveyard of lost voices”) feel overused; emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels constrictive, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
