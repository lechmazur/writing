<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to track social changes feels vague and lacks depth; the "strongly weak" attribute is mentioned but not convincingly explored through actions or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete; levitation as an action lacks grounding in cause and effect, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of an ancient Celtic village is evocative with strong sensory details like mist and thatched roofs, but the atmosphere only partially supports the character's motivation and tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
