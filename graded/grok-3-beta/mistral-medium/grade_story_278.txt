<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the brooding sculptor’s motivations are stated but lack depth or complexity, and the “theoretically spontaneous” trait feels forced rather than organic to his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc but feels rushed and incomplete; the disappearance via dust in a sunbeam is intriguing but lacks logical grounding within the narrative’s constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The impact crater research base setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through imagery (dust and sunbeam), but the emotional resonance is superficial, and the theme of rebirth lacks subtlety or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overly poetic language and generic metaphors (e.g., “carved from light”); the narrative feels formulaic at times, lacking a truly unique voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; while creative in parts, the elements feel stitched together rather than seamlessly integrated, and the style often overshadows clarity.</comment>
