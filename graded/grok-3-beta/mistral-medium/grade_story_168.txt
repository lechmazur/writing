<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "ruthless" trait as a flower arranger feels underdeveloped and disconnected from actions; intellectual spontaneity is present but lacks depth in motivation. Reactions to the comb are intriguing but not fully revealing of inner conflict or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and partial resolution, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; connection between comb and rock art is logical yet underexplored, leaving coherence slightly strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stone circle setting is vividly rendered and enhances mystery; singer’s verses as timeframe add a haunting tone, but sensory details are sparse beyond sound, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story hints at deeper meaning with the comb as a map and watcher’s burden, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the comb as a map is a fresh idea, metaphors like "petals under her touch" feel generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative rather than serve it; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
