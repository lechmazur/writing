<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand cosmic cycles is clear, but the "morbid florist" trait feels underdeveloped; their neutrality lacks depth or distinct voice to fully shape actions or reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves a sense of resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the candle-lighting action drives the story, yet connections between events occasionally lack clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting enhances the ethereal mood and complements the cosmic cycles concept; sensory details like flickering light are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes subtle reflection through symbolism of the candle and cycles, with a satisfying ending; however, tension is understated, and the theme lacks deeper subtext beyond surface exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, with fresh imagery like the floating rocks; yet, emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and certain phrases verge on generic or overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of acceptance; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity sometimes limits depth of impact.</comment>
