<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's wariness and introversion are implied but underdeveloped; motivation to find courage is clear but lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within constraints, but pacing is unevenâ€”middle drags with fog imagery, and resolution feels rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and metaphor, but reliance on predictable transformation trope and overused light imagery dulls impact; tone is consistent but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering idea of courage, though not deeply provocative.</comment>
