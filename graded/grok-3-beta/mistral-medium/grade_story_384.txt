<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of subverting driving the narrative, but the pacing feels uneven, and the connection between analyzing notches and the broader revelation is tenuous, lacking logical clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility and centuries of dust create an intriguing backdrop, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of frenzied tranquility is inconsistently conveyed, missing depth in immersion.</comment>
