<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to chase aurora patterns is clear, but the self-taught wizard lacks depth or a distinct voice; ethereal nature is underutilized in shaping personality or actions beyond description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect with the teddy bear and auroras are logical yet lack deeper narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Virtual reality archive setting is vividly realized with sensory details like alien frequencies, enhancing the elegant chaos tone; however, connection between setting and teddy bear feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and has symbolic depth with the teddy bear as a vessel, but emotional impact is muted by lack of nuanced character reaction; ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining ethereal wizard and digital realm, but metaphors like “mist” and “fireflies” are generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the teddy bear, but style occasionally veers into overwritten descriptions, hindering clarity; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
