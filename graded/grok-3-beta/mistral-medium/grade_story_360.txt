<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The meek necromancer’s sincerity and motivation to decode a universal riddle are clear, but the character lacks depth and a distinct voice; their transformation feels surface-level and predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between the action of regaining clarity and the method of light reflection is somewhat forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of light and dew as revelation is creative, the narrative relies on familiar mystic tropes without subversion, and some metaphors feel generic rather than fresh or nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a lingering sense of introspection, but the style borders on overly ornate at times, and the integration of assigned elements feels somewhat mechanical rather than organic.</comment>
