<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eli's "assertively meek" trait feels inconsistently applied and lacks depth in action or dialogue. Motivation to escape the labyrinth is clear but not emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc; the connection between beginning and end feels forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mirage oasis setting is evocative but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of desperate optimism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or memorable subtext; the labyrinth metaphor is heavy-handed, and the ending feels predictable rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clich√©d metaphors and generic emotional descriptors; the narrative feels formulaic with little unique voice or surprising perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated, and the story lacks depth or lingering impact despite creative potential.</comment>
