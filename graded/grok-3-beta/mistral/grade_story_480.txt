<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but his motivation to feed curiosity feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; his actions align with this trait, yet his distinct voice and emotional nuance are missing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of reigniting authenticity feels vague and lacks a concrete resolution; pacing is uneven, with the ending feeling abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting is evocative and supports the mood of decay and hidden truths, with some effective sensory details; however, the connection between setting and object (grocery receipt) feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has a thoughtful premise and some subtext about authenticity, but it lacks emotional resonance and a satisfying ending; imagery is present but not striking, and the central conflict remains too abstract to grip the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a social media exorcist is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable themes of digital facades; metaphors like "quietly loud" feel forced rather than fresh, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive edge, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
