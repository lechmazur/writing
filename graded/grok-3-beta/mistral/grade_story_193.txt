<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation to cure loneliness is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the trope of the exiled prince; reactions to the mortar and pestle are predictable, missing a distinct voice or nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the snowstorm driving the encounter, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the resolution lacks a stronger causal link to prior events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a fitting atmosphere of isolation, with some evocative details, but sensory immersion is inconsistent, and the settingâ€™s connection to the mortar feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with loneliness as a theme, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable literary devices; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar exile and mystical object tropes without subversion; metaphors like "dry leaves rustling" are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but unremarkable, and while it leaves a faint lingering hope, depth is limited.</comment>
