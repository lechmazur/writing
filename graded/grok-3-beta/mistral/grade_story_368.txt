<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's streetwise nature is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation to harvest hope feels somewhat generic and lacks specificity in how it ties to her background. Her interaction with the brooch reveals little unique personality, and her voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the brooch and temple shifts driving the story forward. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the brooch's patterns and temple changes are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lost orchard temple is vividly described with fruit-laden vines and sensory details like scent and glowing light, enhancing the atmosphere. The setting supports the mood of mystery, though its connection to the timeframe 'unwritten calendar' feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with Lyra's hope, and the brooch as a beacon offers some subtext. However, the ending feels predictable, lacking deeper impact, and the theme of hope from darkness is surface-level without nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a cursed brooch and shifting temple is intriguing, the story leans on familiar tropes of cursed objects and hidden truths without subversion. Metaphors like 'reversed patterns' feel forced, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity. The brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is minimal due to predictable resolution.</comment>
