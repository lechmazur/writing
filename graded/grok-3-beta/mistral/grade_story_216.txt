<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eamon's role as a professional scapegoat is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth beyond a generic desire for meaning; his reactions to the washer and symbols feel somewhat mechanical, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the decoding action driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a fully satisfying causal link to earlier events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cloud city setting is evocative and complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to immerse the reader fully; the library's atmosphere supports the obsessive calm, though inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has potential for emotional impact and a discernible theme of truth versus deception, but it leans too heavily on telling over showing, and the ending feels more abrupt than purposeful; literary devices are underutilized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a scapegoat in a cloud city offers originality, the narrative relies on predictable puzzle-solving tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering idea of truth, though not powerfully enough to stand out in a competitive market.</comment>
