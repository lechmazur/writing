<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's nervousness and insincerity are well-established, but his transformation to determination feels abrupt and lacks depth in internal conflict or gradual growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the transition to Eli's decision, and the connection between the photograph and star patterns lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bacteria-powered city is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with Eli's journey, but symbolism (stars, photograph) feels heavy-handed, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the setting is unique, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of 'finding purpose through journey' without subversion, and emotional expression often states rather than shows nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative elements like the bacteria-powered city, but it lacks a lingering depth or question, feeling more like a surface-level tale than a profound piece.</comment>
