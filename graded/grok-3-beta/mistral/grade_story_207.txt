<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's meekly assertive nature is somewhat reflected in his actions, but his motivation lacks depth and specificity; the blood-sealed oath feels vague and underexplored, weakening character consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of dividing the bouquet feels symbolic yet forced; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and overemphasis on metaphor over substance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned space station medical bay is evocative and ties to the tone of desolation, but sensory details are sparse; the atmosphere supports redemption's path, though the universe's "secret song" feels overly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through symbolism of the bouquet, but it leans too heavily on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks impact due to underdeveloped conflict and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of redemption in a space station is somewhat unique, the narrative relies on predictable tropes of past guilt and symbolic objects; metaphors like the universe's song feel generic and overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
