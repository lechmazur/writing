<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eli's naivety and gambling nature are present but underdeveloped; motivations feel surface-level and lack depth or nuance in reaction to the candle mold and sea bargain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the tide gamble as a climax, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between lectures and the final gamble are tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal station setting is evocative and ties to the sea's unpredictability, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully amplify Eli's desperation or the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the sea and candles, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept of bargaining with the sea offers some originality, the execution relies on predictable gambling tropes, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with little lingering impact.</comment>
