<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eiji's drive to reveal a forbidden tale, but his personality lacks depth beyond being a "dutiful scholar"; reactions and actions align with motivation but feel predictable and lack a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of contaminating the timeline driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect relationships are somewhat vague regarding the well's role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting for time travelers is intriguing and supports the concept, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional weight of Eiji's decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional impact with the forbidden tale, but it relies on telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks subtext or deeper resonance, and tension is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the premise of a time-travel capsule hotel is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of forbidden knowledge without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
