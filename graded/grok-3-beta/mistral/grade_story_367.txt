<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Edmund's "thoughtfully thoughtless" attribute is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; his motivations shift without clear internal logic, and his personality lacks a distinct voice or depth beyond surface-level paradox.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete; the goose's introduction disrupts pacing, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to earlier actions, making the story feel fragmented despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass-walled observatory setting is evocative and ties well to the ocean tides, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the fervent indifference tone or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story has moments of symbolism with the goose and tides, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of perfection's price offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of isolation and obsession without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks clarity or lasting impact, failing to leave a lingering thought or question despite creative potential.</comment>
