<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ser Alistair's earnestness is evident, but his personality lacks depth beyond the quest; motivation is clear but not nuanced, and his reactions to the map feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of triggering power driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
