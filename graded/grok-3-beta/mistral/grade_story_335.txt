<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelis's shaky mercenary background and motivation to make peace with the past are present, but his personality lacks depth beyond surface-level tremors and longing; actions align with motivation but lack a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the amber.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with searching for the unknown driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though the mural-as-map device feels somewhat convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street art haven is vividly realized with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of improbable longing; the setting supports Kaelis's motivation, though the timeframe's "echoing hour" feels underutilized beyond poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kaelis's closure, with decent use of symbolism (amber as trapped past), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is satisfying but not striking, and conflict feels understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the mercenary-seeking-redemption trope isn't subverted; imagery like "web of fate" feels slightly generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated longing than nuanced showing; still, the setting offers some originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the cathedral and amber, but the style occasionally leans on poetic excess over clarity; the brief length feels deliberate, yet the lingering impact is moderate, lacking a profound question or feeling.</comment>
