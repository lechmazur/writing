<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmund's cunning and morally ambiguous nature are hinted at but not deeply explored; his motivation to decode the forgotten feels surface-level and lacks emotional depth or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the sudden shift from grocery shopping to obsession feels rushed and lacks sufficient grounding in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower setting is evocative and ties to the concept of forgotten history, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's obsession or the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with the decoding theme, but it lacks emotional resonance and relies on telling rather than showing; the ending feels abrupt and unsatisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the execution feels formulaic with generic descriptors and predictable progression; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice; it leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
