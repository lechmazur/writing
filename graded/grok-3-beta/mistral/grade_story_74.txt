<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eamon's aloofly intimate nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to escape AI feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the tide-turning action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the cards and the tidal shift lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The setting of the ripple effect study center and pre-land timeframe is imaginative, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the mundane enchantment tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact with the tide's turn, but relies on telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking, and the theme of nature over AI feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the execution leans on predictable rebellion-against-technology tropes, and emotional resonance lacks depth due to generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks clarity in places, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
