<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Elara’s motivation to uncover the past is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond curiosity; her cybernetic nature feels underutilized in shaping her emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between dives and personal growth is somewhat superficial.</comment>
