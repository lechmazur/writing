<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Élodie's motivation as a blameless smuggler driven by survival is clear, but her "logically emotional" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes her decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of overreaching driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and night garden scent create a vivid atmosphere, with strong sensory details like jasmine and rose, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Élodie's mission, and symbolism of the skeleton key is effective, but the ending lacks a powerful punch, and the theme of forgotten histories feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality, the execution relies on predictable tropes of hidden tunnels and forgotten histories; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and some descriptors feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches into ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking deeper resonance.</comment>
