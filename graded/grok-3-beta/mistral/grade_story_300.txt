<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Cassius's tragic past driving his quest, but his personality lacks depth beyond "wistfully pragmatic," and his voice feels generic without distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between smudges and power source is somewhat contrived.</comment>
