<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thorne's "comfortingly pessimistic" attribute is intriguing and shapes his worldview, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and shifts too abruptly from pessimism to yearning for hope without sufficient internal conflict or buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc; vectorizing the flyer drives the story but feels more like a device than a meaningful action, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, leaving the resolution unsatisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The giant mushroom house is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, but its connection to the timeframe of the windmill's final rotation feels forced and underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style feels overly ornate at times, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth, leaving little lingering impact or thought.</comment>
