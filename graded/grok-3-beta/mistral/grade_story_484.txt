<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation to embody his values is stated but lacks depth or specificity; his grogginess as a brewer feels superficial and doesn't distinctly shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the protest and Edgar's personal journey is tenuous, lacking logical cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting is evocative and supports the tone of encroaching darkness, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Edgar's motivation or the protest's context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the broken mirror and darkness, but the emotional impact is muted due to telling rather than showing; the ending feels abrupt and lacks a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable gothic tropes without subversion, and metaphors like "encroaching darkness" are generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, lacking nuanced character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
