<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Edmund's seasickness and awkward charm are mentioned but not deeply integrated into his actions or decisions; his motivation feels vague and lacks specificity beyond a generic longing for transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between moon phases, the bulb, and transformation are underdeveloped, leading to a lack of logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon are visually striking, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only superficially supports the nostalgic tone and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with themes of hope and defiance, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending feels predictable and lacks a deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing leans on generic imagery and overused metaphors like "sailed into the sunset"; lacks originality in emotional portrayal and shows signs of formulaic structure without subversion of tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style feels overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering depth or creative spark to elevate it beyond a surface narrative.</comment>
