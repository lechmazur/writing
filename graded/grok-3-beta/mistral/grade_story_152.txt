<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marco's motivation to salvage his art and past is clear, but his "frenzied" nature feels underexplored, lacking depth in personality or distinct voice beyond melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the action of isolating lacks strong causal impact on the story's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The decaying theater as a "yawning void" effectively mirrors Marco's emotional state, with strong atmosphere, though sensory details are sparse and could be more vivid to enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marco's release of the past, with effective symbolism in juggling ghosts, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "void as a canvas" feel somewhat generic; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the love letter, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
