<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Edgar's phobia-ridden nature as a stunt double is mentioned but not deeply explored; his fears lack specificity and fail to consistently shape his actions or voice beyond surface-level trembling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete with a clear resolution, but pacing is uneven, and the unraveling of the net as a method feels repetitive and lacks deeper narrative propulsion within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a pyramid creates an intriguing atmosphere, and "echoes in the dark" enhance the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to garage sales feels forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through the net as a metaphor for self-discovery, but emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing; the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept of unraveling knots is somewhat original, the narrative leans on clich√©d themes of overcoming fear without fresh perspective; emotional portrayal lacks nuance and feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style often feels overwrought, and the short length exposes a lack of depth; it fails to leave a lasting impression or provoke deeper thought.</comment>
