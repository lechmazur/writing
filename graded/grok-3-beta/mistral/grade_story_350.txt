<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eumolpus as a back-alley puppeteer lacks depth beyond the symbolic connection to puppet strings and human nature. Motivation to uncover truth feels vague and lacks personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of remodeling the gown drives the narrative but feels forced as a method of revelation. The arc is present but lacks a compelling middle, and pacing feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting in an ancient Greek temple is evocative and supports the tone of intimacy, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and object (stamp album) feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact; while symbolism (puppets, gown tears) is present, it feels heavy-handed. The ending is unsatisfying, lacking depth or resonance, and the theme of love and loss is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors like "symphony of truths" and generic descriptors. Emotional handling is surface-level, and the narrative feels formulaic, lacking a unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. The style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the story lacks a lingering impact or depth.</comment>
