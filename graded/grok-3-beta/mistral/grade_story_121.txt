<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eli's "shifty" nature and spontaneity are mentioned but not deeply explored or consistently reflected in actions; motivation to unify hearts feels vague and lacks personal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tailing circuses and reviving the drive-in feels tenuous; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in setting is evocative and ties to the theme of revival, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere supports tone of anguished joy inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact but often tells rather than shows; imagery like "shimmering remains" is intriguing but underdeveloped; ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks polish; brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; lacks lingering depth.</comment>
