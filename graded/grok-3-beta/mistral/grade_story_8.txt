<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edgar's rebellious nature and dazed demeanor are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to blend logic and madness feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with chalking messages driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are surface-level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sound garden setting is evocative and ties well to the musical and natural themes, enhancing the atmosphere, though sensory details are somewhat sparse beyond visual imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and mild wonder through Edgar's creations, with decent use of symbolism, but the emotional impact and subtext remain shallow; dialogue is purposeful but limited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of chalked messages is creative, the narrative leans on predictable artist-as-rebel tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but not consistently striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks profound depth or lingering impact; style is clear but not distinctive enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
