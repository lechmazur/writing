<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Isolde's fierce nature and playful methodology are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to "hush illusions" feels abstract and lacks personal depth, diminishing character resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the zeppelin and dreams connecting beginning to end, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is vividly rendered with decay and silt, enhancing the eerie tone, though sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe "between radio static" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with shared dreams and illusions, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a strong lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of shared dreams offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar ghostly tropes without subversion, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
