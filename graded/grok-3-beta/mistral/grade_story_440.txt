<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaito's "lovingly detached" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to consecrate vows feels noble yet lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory, making his actions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of meddling driving the story forward, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between collage scraps and reaching the sea is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The futuristic city recycling center is vividly described with neon lights and skyscrapers, enhancing the atmosphere of sterile progress, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Yumi's fulfilled vow, and symbolism of sea pottery is effective, but the lack of dialogue and deeper subtext prevents a stronger impact or lasting reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a swordsman as a vow-weaver is original, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of rebellion against a dystopian city, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
