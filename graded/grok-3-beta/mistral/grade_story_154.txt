<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks depth; the connection between tracking urban legends and finding the ink pot feels forced, and pacing is rushed, undermining a complete narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting blends technology and tradition intriguingly, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the tone of jubilant despair or Cian's motivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from clichéd elements like the magical artifact and wise old woman; metaphors are generic, and emotional portrayal feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the story lacks a lingering depth or unique style.</comment>
