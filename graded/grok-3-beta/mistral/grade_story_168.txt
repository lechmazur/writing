<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Edith's ruthlessness and intellectual spontaneity are mentioned but not deeply explored; her motivation to decode the rock art feels surface-level and lacks emotional depth or nuance in reaction to the comb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the comb and the stone circle feels forced; pacing is rushed, and cause-effect links are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle is evocative and supports the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of the singerâ€™s pause feels disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance or subtext; symbolism of the comb and circle is stated rather than shown, and the ending feels predictable without deeper impact or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing relies on repetitive descriptors like "ruthless" and "spontaneous" without fresh nuance; lacks originality in combining elements, feeling somewhat formulaic and predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but lacks depth or lingering impact; style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
