<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Sister Elara's stage fright and exorcist role feel underexplored and disconnected from her actions. Motivation is stated but lacks depth or nuance in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of confronting fears is present but feels rushed and lacks a strong causal link within the tight word limit. The arc is incomplete, with an abrupt shift to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the key, but emotional resonance is limited by overt telling rather than showing. The ending feels purposeful but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats. Metaphors like "ashes of never" feel forced, and the narrative lacks a distinct authorial voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and depth is lacking.</comment>
