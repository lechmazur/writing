<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Edmund's ghost-whispering trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to break free from family expectations is clear but lacks depth in execution. Reactions to the amber are symbolic yet feel forced, and his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from entrapment to liberation is present but feels rushed within the word limit; cause and effect are logical, but pacing suffers from overemphasis on introspection over action, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocative and complements the joyfully melancholic tone well; sensory details are present but not consistently vivid, and the connection between setting and amber feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Edmund's struggle, with decent use of symbolism (amber as rebellion), but the ending feels predictable, and the theme of liberation lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a ghost-whispering wreck-diver is unique, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of family pressure and rebellion without subversion; metaphors like "thawing heart" are overused, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or truly creative synthesis of ideas.</comment>
