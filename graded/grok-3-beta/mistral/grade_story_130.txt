<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eli's "privately open" nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, and his motivation feels generic rather than uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; the reverse-engineering action drives the story but feels disconnected from a broader conflict, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there is some symbolism with the nest, emotional resonance is weak, and the ending lacks a powerful punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable themes of self-acceptance; metaphors like the nest feel overused, and emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story lacks cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth rather than showcasing deliberate brevity.</comment>
