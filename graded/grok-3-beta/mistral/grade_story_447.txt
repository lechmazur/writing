<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edith's dutiful defiance is clear, but her motivation to mend the community feels somewhat idealized and lacks depth in personal conflict or nuance; her voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the unraveling of future news feels contrived and disrupts logical flow; pacing is uneven, with the resolution feeling rushed for the word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amber prison setting is evocative and ties to Edith's isolation, but sensory details are sparse beyond the apple pie aroma; atmosphere supports the tone, though inconsistently developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its community focus, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable literary devices; the ending is purposeful but not striking, and conflict resolution feels overly tidy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of future news bulletins is creative, the execution relies on predictable tropes of small-town redemption; metaphors like "amber prison" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
