<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as a morbid florist is intriguing, but his neutral passion feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in shaping his actions or voice; motivations shift without enough internal conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the candle lighting driving a transformation, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the cosmic cycle concept overshadows logical cause-effect progression within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and lantern's last flicker create a unique, evocative atmosphere that complements the morbid tone; sensory details are present but could be sharper to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on life cycles through symbolism of the candle and plants, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist in a floating dojo shows originality, the narrative leans on predictable transformation tropes without subversion; metaphors like "spectral fingers" feel slightly overused, lacking fresh nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
