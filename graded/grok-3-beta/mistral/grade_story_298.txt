<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Wei’s “rationally impulsive” trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to weave emotional honesty into illusions feels noble but lacks depth in execution. His reaction to the doll’s dress is symbolic but not revelatory of personal stakes. Actions align with motivation, but his voice and personality remain indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reproducing the princess’s story driving the narrative. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between solving mysteries and societal decay isn’t fully logical or fleshed out, leaving coherence slightly strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace reimagined in a post-oil world is evocative, and sunlight through debris enhances the tone of anxious serenity. Sensory details are present but not consistently vivid; the setting supports Wei’s motivation well, though the doll’s dress connection to the palace feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional impact and deeper meaning through societal reflection, with some effective symbolism (sunlight, debris). However, it often tells rather than shows emotions, the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the word limit. Theme is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a chameleon actor solving mysteries in a ruined palace is unique, the execution relies on familiar tropes of lost innocence and societal decay without subversion. Metaphors like “dust of history” feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced. Style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate. However, style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing, and creative integration of elements is uneven. It leaves a lingering thought, but depth beyond the narrative is limited.</comment>
