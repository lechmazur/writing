<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation to restore his lost world is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "trustworthy strange" attribute, which feels superficially applied rather than integral to his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the star alignment and time travel lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is evocative and complements the tone of borrowed dawn, with sensory details like the hum enhancing atmosphere, though other sensory elements are underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eamon's hope, and the lighthouse imagery is strong, but the ending feels predictable, and thereâ€™s little subtext or deeper theme beyond surface longing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a time refugee is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion, and emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the tablecloth, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
