<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn the language of dreams is clear, but Echo's blank-faced nature and "uniquely typical" attribute lack depth or impact on actions; personality feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a decision point, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connection between tracking moon paths and approving dreams is vague, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the orchard with giant ferns and waterfalls is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the character's motivation and the plastic ring feels tenuous.</comment>
