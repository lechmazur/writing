<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Thaddeus's jovial nature and precarious confidence are mentioned but not deeply explored or consistently reflected in actions; motivation to tame darkness feels abstract and lacks personal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between enduring and taming darkness via the metronome feels forced and lacks clear cause-effect logic; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The attic setting is evocative and fits the inventor's theme, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere supports the concept of darkness minimally, with tone feeling inconsistent against fervent indifference.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with darkness as a metaphor, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; ending feels abrupt and lacks resonance; central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on predictable tropes of the eccentric inventor; language is occasionally ornate without purpose, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels constructed around them rather than organic; style lacks clarity at times, and brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
