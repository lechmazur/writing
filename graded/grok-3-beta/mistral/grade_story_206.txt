<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between photographs and the sugar map is somewhat forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a candy sculptor in rebellion is unique, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of resistance without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
