<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to rebuild from ruin is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "restless tailor" trope; reactions to the lantern are intriguing but underdeveloped, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete despite the word limit; the lantern's role in driving spectral visits lacks clear causality, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolutions, though the concept of endurance loosely ties the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The biodome on Mars is evocative and supports the tone of cautious abandon, but sensory details are sparse; the setting enhances isolation, yet its connection to the lantern and action feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Eli's journey, with some effective imagery (Martian silk gown), but lacks deeper subtext or a satisfying conflict resolution; it shows rather than tells at times, yet the theme feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the Mars setting offers some originality, the spectral visits and redemption arc lean on familiar tropes without subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and metaphors like "sculpt a new tomorrow" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
