<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative feels formulaic, leaning on tropes of hidden chambers and cloaked figures without subversion; emotional portrayal is surface-level, and the style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion among assigned elements, feeling constructed around them rather than using them organically; it lacks a lingering impact or creative depth.</comment>
