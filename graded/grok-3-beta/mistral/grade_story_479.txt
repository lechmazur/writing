<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Vivienne's glamour and patience are mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or internal conflict, making her motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but the action of elongating the coffin feels more like a backdrop than a driving force, and the pacing is uneven with too much focus on description over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is intriguing and ties to the theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of jubilant remorse feels inconsistently conveyed, lacking emotional immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while the theme of ordinariness is present, emotional resonance is weak due to telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a powerful punch or lingering thought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic descriptors and predictable undertaker tropes without subversion; the writing lacks a distinct style, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but not seamlessly, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, lacking depth or lasting impact.</comment>
