<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Evelyn's role as a careful poisoner is intriguing but underexplored; her motivation to preserve the forgotten is clear but lacks depth in connection to her dangerous skills.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt drives the plot effectively within the word limit, with a clear arc, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; logical flow is maintained but lacks deeper conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The found object museum setting is vividly realized with sensory details like dusty halls and skateboard clatter, enhancing the tone of dusty starlight, though the timeframe connection to skateboarding feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Evelyn's kinship with the past, with decent use of symbolism (gravity, dance), but lacks a strong central conflict and deeper subtext; the ending is satisfying but not impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "dancing on the edges of gravity" feel somewhat overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the museum and rapier, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought about preservation, though not profoundly.</comment>
