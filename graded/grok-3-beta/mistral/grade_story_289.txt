<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's portrayal as a brainy observer is somewhat developed through his chronicler role, but his motivation to find lost civilizations feels abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes; his reaction to the doll is symbolic but not emotionally revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of enforcing change via street art feels underdeveloped in execution; pacing is uneven, with the ending rushed, and cause-effect links between art and societal change are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay setting is evocative and ties to the mood, but sensory details are sparse; the timeframe of faster-than-light travel feels underutilized, and the atmosphere only partially supports Eli’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about history, with some symbolism around the doll, but lacks emotional depth or a strong central conflict; the theme of strength in weakness is present but not deeply explored, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of ephemeral art is somewhat original, the narrative leans on clichéd ideas of history as a teacher without subversion; metaphors like the doll as fragility are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
