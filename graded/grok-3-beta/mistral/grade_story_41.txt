<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edgar's cosmic powers and factory worker background are intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; the transformation from doubt to decision is abrupt and lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Edgar's powers and his decision to leave the factory is not fully explored or logically justified.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to Edgar's internal struggle feels more symbolic than visceral or immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has a clear theme of breaking free, with some emotional resonance, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful but lacks a lingering impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic powers in a factory worker is unique, the execution relies on predictable tropes of self-discovery without subversion; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style is unremarkable, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it lacks a profound lingering thought or question.</comment>
