<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation to stand for justice is clear, but his "skillfully incompetent" attribute feels inconsistently applied to his personality and fighting style, lacking depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between Edgar's past and present actions lacks clarity within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dusty attic with clockwork animals creates a unique atmosphere, and the chisel strike is evocative, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the action feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Edgar's redemption, but literary devices like the shard's symbolism are heavy-handed, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the redemption arc relies on familiar tropes without subversion, and emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
