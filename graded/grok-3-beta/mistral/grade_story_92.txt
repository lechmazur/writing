<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Edgar's motivation to justify his existence is clear, but his personality as a dog walker for the ultra-rich feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice; his actions align with the motivation but reveal little depth beyond surface-level defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the ghost's resolution; cause and effect are logical, yet the dare as a plot driver lacks sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The haunted mansion dining room and twilight timeframe create a fitting atmosphere of "loud silence," enhanced by sensory details like dust and shadows, but the setting's connection to Edgar's motivation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through Edgar's connection to the plants and ghost, but it leans on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks lasting impact, and literary devices like symbolism are present but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on predictable haunted mansion tropes without subversion; metaphors like the wilting plants are generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, lacking a truly unique authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and while thereâ€™s a lingering thought of breaking silent agreements, it lacks depth for a prestigious publication.</comment>
