<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Althea’s motivation to enlighten humanity is clear, but her "righteously flawed" attribute feels underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes her internal conflict or actions beyond a surface mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the organ’s reverberation and plot progression is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Roman bathhouse reborn as a concert hall is vividly rendered and complements the tone of fierce tenderness; however, sensory details beyond sound are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity through its cosmic themes, and the organ-cosmos metaphor is effective, but the emotional impact is diluted by telling rather than showing Althea’s tenderness and students’ transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise of an alien teacher is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of hidden knowledge without subversion, and emotional descriptions lack nuanced subtext, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
