<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eli's hesitance and awkwardness are mentioned but not deeply explored or reflected in his actions; motivation to restore systems feels stated rather than felt, lacking depth in emotional stakes or personal connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the postcard as a catalyst, but pacing feels rushed at the transition to the new world; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks specificity and feels incomplete within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and enhances the otherworldly tone, but sensory details are unevenly applied; the setting supports the concept of bridging worlds, though its connection to Eliâ€™s motivation feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the postcard and bridging worlds, but emotional impact is minimal due to telling over showing; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, and tension is underdeveloped within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the concept of bridging worlds offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar fantasy tropes without subversion; metaphors like hermit crabs feel forced, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
