<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Edmund's crisis as a labyrinth architect is clear, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level isolation; reactions to objects like vintage calling cards feel symbolic but underdeveloped in revealing character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a fully satisfying resolution or logical cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the migration pattern archive is evocative and supports the tone of desperate hope; sensory details like the radio hum are effective, though some elements feel disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through unspoken bonds, with some effective symbolism in the map of the heart; however, dialogue is minimal and subtext feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on predictable tropes of isolation and longing without subversion; metaphors like "map of the heart" are somewhat generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than integral; style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
