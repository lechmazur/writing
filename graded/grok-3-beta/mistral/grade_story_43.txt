<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's "loudly introverted" nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to find courage feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with meandering driving the exploration, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The neon cathedral setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of crooked hope; sensory details like flickering lights and fog enhance atmosphere, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of rediscovered courage, but relies heavily on telling over showing; symbolism of the CD is effective yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a neon cathedral is unique, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of lost hope and rediscovery without subversion; metaphors like "dying candles" feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
