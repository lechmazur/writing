<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elara’s motivation to overcome shame is clear, but her free-spirited nature feels underexplored and her voice is not distinct enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the sewing kit and her transformation could be more organic.</comment>
