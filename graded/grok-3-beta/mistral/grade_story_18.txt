<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; cause and effect are logical, though the concept of recognition drives the story unevenly at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like fog and engine puffs, enhancing the gloomy tone; atmosphere supports the theme, though setting-object connection feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of truth, and imagery like "ink in calligraphy" is striking, but the ending feels slightly pat; conflict resolution lacks depth within the word limit.</comment>
