<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to uncover truth is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "forgotten noble" trope; reactions to the drone and ticket stubs feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; the reassembly of ticket stubs as a method feels underdeveloped and disconnected from a satisfying conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The spontaneous combustion lab setting is vivid and complements the tone of hollow recklessness, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery (flames, ashes) is evocative, but the story lacks emotional depth or a memorable perspective; the ending feels unresolved, and the central conflict is vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable noble-downfall tropes without subversion; metaphors like "dance of truth and deceit" are generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
