<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eolande's portrayal as an old-fashioned mage with a purposefully aimless nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to claim an uncharted frontier feels vague and lacks depth in driving his actions consistently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the unfolding riddle driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the arctic setting and ancient Egypt is not fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arctic research greenhouse is vividly described and contrasts effectively with the tone of sanctified dread, enhancing the mood; however, sensory details are uneven, and the setting's connection to the pharaoh’s coffin feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Eolande’s rediscovery of past lives, with strong imagery and symbolism in the mirror reflections; yet, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mirror reflections and past lives offers originality, the narrative occasionally leans on familiar tropes of lost memory without subversion; emotional resonance is present but sometimes stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks depth.</comment>
