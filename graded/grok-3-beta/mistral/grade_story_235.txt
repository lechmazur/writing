<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters Yumi and Hiroshi lack depth; their motivations are stated but not deeply explored or convincingly shown through actions. Yumi's fascination with meteor showers feels more like a plot device than a personal trait, and Hiroshi's interest in her remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels underdeveloped within the word limit; the connection between meteor showers and unspoken love is intriguing but lacks logical progression or emotional weight, making the resolution feel abrupt and unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ancient Japanese castle setting is evocative and complements the tone of distant intimacy, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the characters' motivations or the central concept of intertwined fates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional resonance through silent dialogues and symbolism of flowers and stars, but it overly relies on telling rather than showing; the ending feels more poetic than impactful, lacking a strong central conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding meteor showers is unique, the execution leans on predictable romantic tropes without subversion; language is occasionally ornate ("distant intimacy blossoming") and lacks fresh metaphors, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
