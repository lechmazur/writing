<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Evan's aloofness as a cartographer is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to learn the language of the soul feels lofty but lacks grounding in personal stakes or backstory, making his actions feel somewhat detached from a distinct personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between memory and mapping drives the story, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The futuristic shopping mall setting is intriguing and visually described with holographic ads, but sensory details are sparse beyond the visual, and the atmosphere only moderately supports the emotional tone of memory and resignation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Lily’s journey, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery like the map’s blues and greens is evocative, yet the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the theme of memory feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping memories is somewhat original, the execution leans on predictable emotional beats without subversion; metaphors like “language of the soul” feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with its elements, but they often feel forced into service rather than naturally integrated; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
