<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eli's hardheadedness and brokenness are mentioned but not deeply explored; motivation for solace feels surface-level and lacks nuanced development within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but the struggle with the prophecy feels rushed and lacks clear cause-effect progression; pacing is uneven within the word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery and snow days create a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone of demure audacity; sensory details are present but not consistently evocative or tied to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional depth and uses imagery, but the impact is muted by overt telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful but not particularly memorable or layered with subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of redemption and prophecy without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
