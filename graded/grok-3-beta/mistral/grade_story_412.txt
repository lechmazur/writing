<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmund's bookish nature and assassin role are intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to establish a new order feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the sudden code revelation; logical flow is maintained, though connections between nightmares and action are somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Frequency monitoring station setting is evocative and ties to the plot, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere; tone of mournful elation aligns with concept but lacks vivid grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through mournful elation, but relies heavily on telling over showing; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying; lacks strong subtext or memorable literary devices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but writing leans on predictable assassin tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced; metaphors like "labyrinth of memories" are generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels like a limitation, not a deliberate choice.</comment>
