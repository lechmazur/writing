<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation for redemption is clear, but his personality as a subdued vigilante lacks depth and distinctiveness; his "artfully clumsy" attribute feels superficial and underexplored in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between tracking distortions in the mirror and the action of pursuing Victor feels forced and lacks logical grounding; pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area is evocatively described with sensory details like "screaming silence," enhancing the mood, but the setting's connection to the mirror and virtual calls feels tenuous and underutilized for deeper atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with the price of war, but it relies on telling rather than showing Eli's burden; imagery like the mirror is intriguing but lacks deeper subtext or a satisfying thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the mirror-tracking method is original, the story leans on predictable vigilante tropes without subversion; emotional portrayal is stated rather than nuanced, and the prose occasionally feels formulaic with generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the narrative lacks a lingering depth or memorable impact.</comment>
