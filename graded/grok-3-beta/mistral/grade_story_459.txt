<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmund's character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, but his "elegantly clumsy" trait feels superficial and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from burden to resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between staking out ghost tours and personal liberation is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is unique but underutilized in enhancing the ghostly atmosphere or action; sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen the mood of silence and loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Edmund's journey, with some effective symbolism in the flower crown, but the writing often tells rather than shows, and the theme of redemption feels surface-level without deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality, the execution relies on predictable ghost story tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions lack nuance, feeling somewhat generic and stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought of redemption, though not powerfully enough for a top-tier publication.</comment>
