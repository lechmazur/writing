<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Thaddeus's motivation as a pickpocket is clear, but his sudden defiance and transformation lack depth or gradual build-up, feeling abrupt and unearned for a character with little distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the dummy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between Thaddeus's encounter and his transformation feels forced, with pacing rushed at the resolution, undermining coherence and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is evocatively described with sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, but the setting's connection to the dummy and transformation concept feels superficial, missing deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional impact through Thaddeus's change, but it relies on telling rather than showing, with dialogue from the dummy feeling unnatural and the ending lacking a satisfying or layered resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on predictable horror tropes without subversion, with generic descriptors and a lack of fresh metaphors; emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, suggesting formulaic construction over unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While some elements are creatively combined, the story lacks cohesion and depth, with the brief length feeling like a limitation rather than a choice, and failing to leave a lingering impact or question for the reader.</comment>
