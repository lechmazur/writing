<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Brother Alistair's stubbornness is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; the connection between his traits and actions is surface-level, with little distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the flute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the dream, flute, and dark reflection feels forced, with pacing that rushes key revelations without sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aerial gondola setting and cautious enchantment tone are evocative and complement the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the flute and motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with the dark reflection, but lacks emotional resonance or strong subtext; the writing shows rather than tells at times, yet the ending feels predictable and lacks impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on familiar tropes of inner conflict without subversion, and descriptions like "cautious enchantment" feel generic; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels constrained by them rather than elevated; it lacks a lingering thought or depth, with style that neither hinders nor enhances clarity significantly.</comment>
