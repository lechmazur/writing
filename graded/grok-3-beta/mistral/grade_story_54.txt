<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Kaelanâ€™s even-tempered nature and rebellious streak are stated but not vividly shown through actions or nuanced reactions, making his motivations feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit, but the action of offloading artifacts feels underdeveloped as a central driver, and the pacing is uneven, with the ending feeling abrupt rather than resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocative and ties well to the melancholic tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance, particularly with the unsent letter, but relies too heavily on telling rather than showing emotions; literary devices like symbolism are present but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by somewhat generic metaphors and a predictable narrative arc; emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating feelings directly, and the style feels formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but not in a way that feels essential or innovative, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
