<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Kaito's arrogance and doubt are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or dialogue, and his motivation feels somewhat generic despite the potential for complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit but feels rushed; the arc from doubt to resolution is abrupt, lacking sufficient build-up or tension to make the transformation convincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is evocative and supports the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with the phoenix symbolism, but the emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on familiar tropes of the doubting warrior and wise mentor; metaphors like "darkness as canvas" feel overused, and emotional handling lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; it incorporates assigned elements adequately but lacks the creative spark or depth needed to stand out in a competitive literary market.</comment>
