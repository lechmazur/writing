<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amelia's amiable nature is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation to fuse lore and dreams is clear but lacks depth in execution. Her interaction with the crossword feels somewhat superficial, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to fully reveal her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed. The concept of navigating shadows drives the story, though cause and effect between the vibrations and revelations are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly rendered and complements the tone of humble rebellion well. Sensory details like creaking timbers enhance atmosphere, though some descriptions lack specificity, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Amelia's purpose, and imagery like the lighthouse as a "beacon for stories" is effective. However, the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict is too subtle, lacking sharp tension or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "tide of time" feel overused. Emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly unique style or surprising twist, leaning on familiar gothic tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but it doesn't fully transcend the constraints of its brevity. Creative thinking is present but not striking, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking profound depth or a haunting question.</comment>
