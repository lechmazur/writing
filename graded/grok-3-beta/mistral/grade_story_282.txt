<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's brashness and wild demeanor are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to preserve community feels sudden and lacks depth in connection to his established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "detonating" a spark feels metaphorical rather than concrete, weakening coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The discount store at closing time sets a melancholic tone that supports the theme of loss, and sensory details like dancing dust particles are evocative, but the setting's connection to the war medal feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with themes of community and nostalgia, and the medal's symbolism is effective, but the impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on familiar tropes of a rough exterior hiding a soft heart; metaphors like "dancing dust particles" are somewhat generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a faint lingering thought, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
