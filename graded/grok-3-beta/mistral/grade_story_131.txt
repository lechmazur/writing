<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to transform fear into courage feels somewhat forced and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the stones and message.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the cryptic message and Eli's transformation feels abrupt and lacks clear cause-effect logic; pacing is uneven, with the resolution feeling rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is intriguing and ties to the stones' behavior, enhancing the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of affectionate detachment doesn't fully mesh with the eerie mood of the anomaly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eli's transformation, with some symbolism in the stones, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is purposeful but not striking, and conflict resolution feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of gravitational anomaly offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of personal transformation without subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, and metaphors like "turbulent sea" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with the assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; the style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
