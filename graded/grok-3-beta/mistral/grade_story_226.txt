<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eamon's gloomy nature and motivation to collect lost lullabies are clear, but his transition from orchardist to scientist lacks depth; reactions to the skull reveal little new about his character beyond surface obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of containing the skull driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the black-market method feels underexplored and somewhat convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The resonance testing facility and desert setting are vividly described with sensory details like scorching winds, effectively supporting the tone of haggard awe; however, the connection between the skull and setting could be more meaningfully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative response with imagery of lost lullabies and ancient winds, and the ending feels purposeful; yet, it lacks deeper subtext or a stronger central conflict, relying more on atmosphere than tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of capturing resonances is unique, some descriptions (e.g., "genuinely artificial harmony") feel overly ornate and vague; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the skull and lullabies, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaborate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
