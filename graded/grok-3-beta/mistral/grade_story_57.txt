<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmund's submissive nature as an aristocrat is hinted at but not deeply explored; his empathy drives actions, but motivations lack depth and complexity for a truly nuanced character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from yard work to mission, but the transition via eavesdropping feels abrupt and the pacing slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse and workshop settings are evocative with sensory details, but the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the tone of earnest flippancy or tie deeply to the concept of silent empathy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through the sparrow rescue, but lacks significant subtext or memorable literary devices; dialogue feels purposeful but not natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable spy tropes without subversion; sensory details are present but generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
