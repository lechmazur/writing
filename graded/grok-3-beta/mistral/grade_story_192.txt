<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marco's motivation to find connection is clear, but his personality as an "eager lookout" feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice; his reactions to the supernatural are predictable rather than revealing deeper traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the spirits and Marco's actions lacks depth or logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman villa setting is evocative and ties to the theme of past connection, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the supernatural elements or Marco's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of connection, but lacks impactful literary devices or subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not particularly memorable or layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on familiar supernatural tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown; writing style is functional but lacks originality or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; it lacks a lingering impact or creative depth, feeling constrained by its brevity rather than deliberate.</comment>
