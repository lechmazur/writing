<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Edgar's dry wit is mentioned but not effectively shown through dialogue or action; his motivation to learn traditional methods feels surface-level and lacks depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a basic arc but feels rushed and incomplete within the word limit; the connection between the action of confiscating the journal and the resolution is tenuous and lacks strong cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom sets an evocative mood with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation or the concept of eroding promises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story lacks emotional resonance or subtext; literary devices like the dance metaphor feel forced and underdeveloped, and the ending is predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on clich√©s like the haunted setting without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
