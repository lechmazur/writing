<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's forlorn nature and analytically unpredictable attribute are mentioned but not deeply explored; motivation to reveal the child within feels surface-level and lacks nuanced development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with Eli's moon-tracking sprints driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between curiosity and plot direction could be more impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nomad caravan setting and spring cleaning timeframe are fitting, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only moderately supports the joyful sorrow tone and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Eli's transformation, but lacks strong literary devices or subtext; the ending is satisfying but not particularly memorable or layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable themes of rediscovery without fresh subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a deliberate short length, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the lingering impact is minimal despite creative use of moon trails and thread.</comment>
