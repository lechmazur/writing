<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but the transition from discovery to restoration feels rushed, lacking depth in cause-and-effect progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of restoration and hope without fresh subversion; emotional resonance feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
