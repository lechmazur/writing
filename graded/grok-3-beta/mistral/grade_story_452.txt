<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's softhearted nature is evident, but her motivations feel somewhat vague and inconsistently tied to her actions; the belt buckle connection lacks depth in revealing her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between stabilizing fate and midnight visits feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed resolutions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of fate and cosmos offers some originality, the narrative leans on cyberpunk tropes without subversion; metaphors like "dying hologram" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
