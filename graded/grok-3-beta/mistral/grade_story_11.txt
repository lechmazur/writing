<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eamon's motivation to leave a lasting legacy is clear, but his "flighty" nature is underdeveloped and does not distinctly shape his actions or voice, rendering the character somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a clear beginning and resolution, but the action of linearizing the city feels underexplored within the word limit, and pacing is uneven, with rushed exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The initiation hall setting is evocative and fits the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere does not deeply enhance Eamon's motivation or the concept of unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and a discernible theme of unity, but it lacks emotional depth, relies on telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative leans on familiar tropes of hidden knowledge and secret societies without subversion, and the writing lacks a distinct style or nuanced emotional resonance, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but lacks depth or lingering impact; the elements are integrated but not in a way that feels innovative, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
