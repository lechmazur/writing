<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Eldon’s “ferociously polite” trait feels surface-level and underexplored in action, while his motivation for harmony with nature is clear but not uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing Ascending pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and the intervention action drives the story logically, though transitions between scenes lack smoothness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flower pressing workshop setting is vividly described with strong sensory details (scent of petals), enhancing atmosphere and complementing the nature harmony concept, though the timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes mild emotional response through Lyra’s anguished joy, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable uniqueness; writing style is competent but not striking, with limited showing over telling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is fair despite multiple elements, but the story feels built around them rather than them serving a deeper narrative; length feels limiting, and impact is moderate without lingering depth.</comment>
