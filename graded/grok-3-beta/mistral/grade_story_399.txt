<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Goran's grumpiness is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to quell an inner uprising is clear but lacks specificity in how it ties to his past actions or personality beyond trauma. His reaction to the scroll reveals inner conflict, but the transformation feels slightly abrupt without a distinct voice or nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the action of jiggling and the concept of trauma. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between the mandala patterns and life-altering change is more symbolic than logically grounded, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a mystical atmosphere that complements the tone of grandiose subtlety and supports Goran's introspective motivation. Sensory details are present but could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader in the setting and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Goran's healing, with effective use of symbolism (mandala, scroll). The theme of trauma's importance is clear, but the ending feels somewhat predictable, and the lack of dialogue limits character depth. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the transformation narrative feels somewhat formulaic, and metaphors like "memories as graves" are not entirely fresh. Emotional handling shows some nuance through action, but the style lacks a truly unique voice, and descriptions occasionally lean toward generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel more symbolic than integral. The style supports clarity, but the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate. It leaves a lingering thought about trauma, but lacks the depth for a truly profound impact.</comment>
