<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eamon's yearning for escape, but his sullen nature and bias against technology feel underexplored and lack depth in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the submarine construction lacks logical detail within the word limit.</comment>
