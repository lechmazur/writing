<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miranda's rebellious nature and motivation to write obituaries for the living are clear and drive her actions, but her deeper personality lacks nuance beyond this trait, and her voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the mask's manifestation driving the story forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the mask's sudden attachment, are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is vividly imagined and enhances the atmosphere of discovery, with sensory details like musty air and humming resonance, though the connection to the revolution below feels underexplored.</comment>
