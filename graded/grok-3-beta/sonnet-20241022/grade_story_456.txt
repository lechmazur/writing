<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marigold's morbid fascination as a florist is clear, and her motivation to understand cosmic cycles aligns with her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits, resulting in a somewhat flat character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than causal, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is vividly realized and enhances the mystical atmosphere, supporting the theme of balance, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on life and death with strong symbolism in the floating flowers, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced 'showing' over 'telling,' and the ending feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist in a floating dojo is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "delicate dance") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies on stated insights rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans on ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and depth of lingering impact.</comment>
