<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's wayward nature as an apothecary is intriguing, but her motivations lack depth beyond the romantic pursuit; her distinct voice is present yet underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the butterfly tracking driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to prior events within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like clinking vials and hissing pipes, enhancing the atmosphere, though the tone occasionally wavers between marvel and melancholy without clear intent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through the love letter in biochemistry, with strong imagery, but the central conflict feels underexplored, and the theme of unconventional love lacks deeper subtext beyond the surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of butterflies as a biochemical beacon is original, some metaphors (rust on brass) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like butterflies and morse code, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
