<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lady Marianne's background as a forgotten noble is intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; her shift to embracing truth lacks depth or gradual build-up, making her actions seem abrupt rather than rooted in character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear connection between combustion and truth, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a fully satisfying causal link to prior events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The spontaneous combustion lab setting is evocative and ties well to the concept of burning truth, with strong visual details like the drone's crystalline wings; however, sensory immersion beyond sight is minimal, limiting atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about truth and illusion through potent symbolism of fire, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is undercut by telling over showing; the central theme is clear but lacks nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of reality burning through fantasy is original, some metaphors (e.g., "combustible nature of truth") feel overused; emotional portrayal leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the drone and ticket stubs, and it leaves a lingering thought about truth, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
