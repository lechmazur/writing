<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's solitary nature and artistic identity as a painter are well-integrated into her motivations, but her inner conflict and personality lack deeper nuance; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from temporary assignment to seeking permanent residency is clear, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; logical flow is maintained, though the transition to her final decision lacks buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden setting is vividly realized with sensory details like crystalline petals and Earth's glow, enhancing the intimate tone; however, some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdescribed, detracting from immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., zero-g flowers as evolution) evoke wonder, and the ending is purposeful; yet, emotional depth is more told than shown, and the central conflict feels underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of zero-g horticulture offers originality, but some metaphors (e.g., "love letter to the impossible") feel familiar; emotional resonance is present but lacks subtlety, occasionally relying on stated feelings over nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the garden and notepad, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
