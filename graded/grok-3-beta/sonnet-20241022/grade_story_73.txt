<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miguel's portrayal as a steady gravedigger with a whimsical diligence is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth beyond the inherited role of guardian; his reactions to the supernatural feel predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the overlapping worlds driving the narrative, but pacing feels unevenâ€”rushed at the supernatural reveal and slow in reflective moments; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Aztec temple setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the hush of wind and glowing symbols, enhancing the mystical atmosphere; however, the modern-tourist elements feel underexplored, slightly weakening the setting's full potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet wonder through imagery and symbolism of overlapping worlds, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict is understated, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of worlds overlapping offers originality, the execution leans on familiar supernatural tropes without subversion; metaphors like "translucent pages" are evocative but not entirely fresh; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the magnifying glass and temple, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
