<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sarah's overzealousness as a park ranger is evident in her night patrols, but her deeper motivations tied to her grandmother's legacy feel underexplored, lacking emotional depth in her reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Sarah's actions and the goddess's appearance lacks clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a repurposed highway is vividly realized with sensory details like crunching apples, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the tone occasionally wavers between mystical and mundane.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about dreams and humanity's loss, with strong imagery like fruit crystallizing dreams, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a dream-preserving orchard is original, but some metaphors (e.g., "mist through rows") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated connections than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the notebook and orchard, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
