<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's ordinariness is well-integrated as a contrast to his extraordinary discovery, and his restlessness drives the narrative, but his inner transformation lacks depth and specificity, making his motivation feel somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the release of whispers driving a transformative climax, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the rift's introduction—and the connection between wandering and cosmic translation isn't fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dimensional rift and theatre setting create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid mosaic imagery, but sensory details are sparse beyond the tiles, and the timeframe of "memory flickering into legend" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through cosmic metaphors and a satisfying ending, with strong subtext about ordinariness hiding purpose, but it leans heavily on telling over showing, and the central theme of translation feels slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a wayfarer decoding the universe is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., "cosmic alphabet") border on cliché, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, but uneven pacing and abstract emotional depth hinder clarity and impact, making it fall short of top-tier publishability.</comment>
