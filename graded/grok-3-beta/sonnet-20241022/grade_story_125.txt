<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's underachievement and averageness shape his personality well, with clear motivation to overcome self-doubt, but his voice lacks distinctiveness, and reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical progression within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the unveiling action, while central, lacks deeper tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The setting of the control room and farmland boundary is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the bored excitement tone or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Marcus's realization, with some subtext about self-worth, but the ending feels tidy rather than impactful, and literary devices are minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of averageness as a superpower is somewhat original, but the narrative leans on familiar "hidden potential" tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it lacks a lingering depth or question; the style is clear but unremarkable, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
