<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to correct a past regret is clear, but her personality as a wandering fireworks designer feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to her journey's revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between frost patterns and firework designs, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration of key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hidden library behind the waterfall is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like bioluminescent moss and suspended water droplets, strongly supporting the atmosphere, though the timeframe's ephemeral nature feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective emotional response through imagery of frost and fireworks, with a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext or a strong central conflict, relying heavily on descriptive telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of blending nature's patterns with pyrotechnics is original, some metaphors (e.g., frost as a key) feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced character reactions.</comment>
