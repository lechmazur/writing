<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as a time refugee is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond her mission; her voice and reactions feel somewhat archetypal rather than uniquely nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with dense exposition overshadowing action; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks a strong emotional punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is vividly realized and enhances the mood of isolation, with strong sensory imagery; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more tightly woven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses effective symbolism (lighthouse beam as memory), but the ending feels more contemplative than impactful; subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of temporal displacement is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes without significant subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the lighthouse and tablecloth, but the style leans toward overwriting, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a deeply provocative one.</comment>
