<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its surreal approach, but some metaphors (e.g., painted smile outshining aurora) feel overused, and emotional depth occasionally leans on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
