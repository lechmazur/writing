<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's gift of tasting memories shapes her internal conflict and hesitation, but her motivation to confront Auguste feels underdeveloped beyond surface-level pain; her distinct voice is present but lacks deeper nuance in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The Alpine valley and stadium setting are evocative with sensory details like rain and yodeling, enhancing mood, but the connection between setting and herbs feels tenuous; atmosphere supports the ruminative tone well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through forgiveness, with some effective imagery (rain trails as tears), but subtext is shallow; dialogue is purposeful but not particularly natural; central conflict is clear but resolution feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of tasting memories is unique, metaphors like rain trails and forgiveness's embrace feel somewhat generic; emotional handling shows nuance in memories but often states feelings directly; overall style lacks a distinct edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like tasting memories, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with overused imagery; it leaves a lingering thought on forgiveness, though depth feels constrained by predictability.</comment>
