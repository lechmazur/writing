<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Subject 7's motivation to restore natural weather patterns is clear and aligns with his backstory as an escaped experiment, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "gentle touch" attribute; there’s little distinct voice or internal conflict to elevate the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Subject 7’s subtle revolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between ghost stories and his actions is tenuous, and the resolution lacks a stronger climactic moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The weather station setting is evocative and ties well to the concept of mechanized weather, with strong sensory details like cloud shadows; however, the ghost story timeframe feels underutilized and doesn’t fully enhance the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through its theme of beauty versus mechanization, with effective imagery like cloud-shadow painting; yet, the lack of dialogue and deeper subtext limits its impact and memorability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of restoring weather via cloud shadows is original, some metaphors (e.g., "wild mathematics") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, missing nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally leans toward ornate language, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
