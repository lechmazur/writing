<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's insomnia and poetic nature are clear, but his motivations feel somewhat surface-level; the drive to decode botanical messages lacks deeper emotional grounding or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with whispers driving Marcus's actions, but pacing feels unevenâ€”some moments linger too long on description, while key revelations are rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway timeframe create a compelling, eerie atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like train vibrations; however, some connections between setting and botanical samples feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about non-violence through nature's persistence, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the ending feels slightly predictable, lacking a sharper emotional punch or surprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of botanical wisdom is unique, some metaphors (e.g., growing through cracks) are overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like whispers and samples, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
