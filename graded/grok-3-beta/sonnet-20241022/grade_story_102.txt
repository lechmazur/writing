<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's spineless nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivations shift without enough depth or nuance to feel fully convincing. Sarah lacks a distinct voice or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the key and prophecy driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly realized and enhances the luminous, mysterious atmosphere, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the key and maps, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
