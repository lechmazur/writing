<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's hesitance and awkwardness are evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the internal conflict lacks depth, and his voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the postcard and crab patterns driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frigid orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and enhances the ethereal tone; sensory details like steam and ice are effective, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on duty versus doubt, with decent use of symbolism (crabs, shells), but the emotional impact is muted, and the ending feels more functional than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of hermit crabs and world-bridging is original, and metaphors are mostly fresh, but some descriptions (e.g., "bitter wind carried whispers") lean on familiar tropes, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
