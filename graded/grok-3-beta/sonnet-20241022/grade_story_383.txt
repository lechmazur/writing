<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>General Marcus's burnt-out state is evident, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level anxiety; his interaction with the waitress feels contrived rather than revealing of nuanced character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed emotional shifts and a lack of clear cause-effect in Marcus's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dark matter diner setting is vividly imagined with strong atmosphere, enhancing the surreal tone, though sensory details are inconsistently specific and sometimes overly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Marcus's anxiety, but literary devices like quantum metaphors feel forced; the ending is purposeful yet lacks lasting impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the surreal diner offers some originality, the narrative leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with overdone surrealism; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
