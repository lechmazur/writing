<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miss Haversham's role as a begrudging guardian is clear, and her motivation to rediscover joy is consistent, but her internal conflict lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice, feeling somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the postcards driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks grounding in prior cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mechanical bird sanctuary and spacetime folds create a unique atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like whirring gears, though the tone of joyful sorrow occasionally feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through imagery and symbolism of freedom, but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension or subtext to elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mechanical birds and liberation is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "tears of oil") feel clich√©d for steampunk, and emotional resonance relies more on stating feelings than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like postcards and the sanctuary, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
