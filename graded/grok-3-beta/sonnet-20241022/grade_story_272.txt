<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's social awkwardness is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from digital obsession to embracing traditional crafts lacks depth in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the reversed trails concept driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The diner setting during the late shift complements the tone of restless acceptance, and sensory details like flickering lights are present, but the atmosphere lacks deeper integration with the forgotten arts concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Marcus's realization, and the whistle as a symbol of harmony is effective, but dialogue is minimal and subtext feels surface-level; conflict resolution is predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the narrative of bridging old and new feels familiar; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and sensory details are somewhat generic, lacking a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style is functional rather than striking; it leaves a mild lingering thought about balance, though the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
