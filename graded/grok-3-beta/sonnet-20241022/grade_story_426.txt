<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Echo's secretive nature and motivation to preserve folk medicines are clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the surface mission; her reactions to the teapot feel more symbolic than personal, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the hacking of playlists driving the narrative forward logically, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between marathon training and the core mission is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative and complements the aloof passion tone, with the ghost train enhancing the secretive atmosphere; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the eerie mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Echo's mission, with some symbolism in the teapot and ghost train, but the central conflict lacks intensity; the writing shows rather than tells at times, yet the theme of preserving legacy feels surface-level without deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining hacking playlists with folk medicine, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptions (e.g., "burning anger") are generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully developed, and the tone remains consistent without unnatural shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the ghost train and playlists, but the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought about legacy, though style occasionally lacks the polish for top-tier impact.</comment>
