<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brother Chen's stubbornness and dedication to vengeance are clear, shaping his actions and motivations, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; his voice feels somewhat generic despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between past and present, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a stronger emotional punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aerial gondola setting and mountain imagery enhance the atmosphere of isolation and reflection, with evocative visual details, though sensory depth beyond sight is limited, missing opportunities for richer immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet tension and offers subtext about identity and justice, with effective symbolism in the flute, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced character reaction at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the twin brother twist offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar revenge tropes without fully subverting them; metaphors like "dark reflection" feel slightly overused, though the style is mostly purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the flute, but the brief length slightly undermines emotional depth; it leaves a lingering thought about justice, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
