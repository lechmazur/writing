<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the search for meaning, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between jogging and decoding tea leaves lacks full logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport is vividly described with strong sensory details like cracked tarmac and skeletal towers, enhancing the mood of isolation, though the connection to hidden waterfalls feels slightly forced.</comment>
