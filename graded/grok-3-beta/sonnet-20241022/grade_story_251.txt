<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miranda's ambivalence as a prophet is intriguing and shapes her personality, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the story hints at a desire to rewrite fate, yet lacks depth in why she feels compelled to do so beyond vague destiny.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with defragmenting prophecies driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the cosmic scoreboard's role in the resolution lacks clear cause-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like mechanical heartbeats and oxygen recyclers, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and marbles feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mix of awe and melancholy, with strong imagery like marbles as broken moons, but the ending feels more confusing than satisfying, and the central conflict of rewriting fate lacks sharp tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a doubting prophet is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., cosmic scoreboard) feel generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings like "tears of joy" rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like marbles and puzzles, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a fully lingering impact.</comment>
