<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edmund's hopeful and naive nature is evident, shaping his trust in the universe, but his "cleverly naive" attribute feels underexplored in action; motivation is clear but lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with the Regret Engine as a central conflict, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the resolution lacks depth within the word limit, leaving the arc slightly incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with evocative imagery of the mystic orchard and crystalline fruit, enhancing the tone of agonizing bliss; however, sensory details could be more varied beyond sight and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the theme of loss and redemption, with strong imagery and subtext; yet, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict's resolution lacks a surprising punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of frequencies and puzzle pieces is creative, some metaphors (e.g., "liquid starlight") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not profoundly unique.</comment>
