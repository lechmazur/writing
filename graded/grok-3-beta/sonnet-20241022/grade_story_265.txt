<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Deputy Chen's impassive nature is well-established, but her internal shift toward awe feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation beyond surface observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the tight word limit; the bees' dance builds tension but resolves into an abstract moment without tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lush cathedral-orchard setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the mystical atmosphere, though the timeframe of oil changes feels awkwardly juxtaposed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (bees as messengers, cathedral as temple) are striking, but emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper conflict or character stakes; the ending feels more poetic than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of bees' secret language is intriguing, the narrative leans on somewhat generic descriptors of awe and mystery, lacking a truly unique voice or surprising subversion of tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive tone and some creative integration of elements, but its brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, leaving lingering questions without sufficient depth.</comment>
