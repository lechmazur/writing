<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira Kane's motivation to preserve Dr. Chen's legacy is clear, and her impulsively thoughtful nature shapes her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the raider archetype, and her voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between Mira's actions and the broader social upheaval is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater laboratory setting is vividly described with sensory details like flickering lights and seawater, enhancing the atmosphere of desperation, though the tone of fractured grace occasionally feels forced against the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and some emotional response through Mira's desperate transcription, with effective symbolism in the charcoal markings, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and premise, it leans on familiar tropes of a lone protector against a corrupt force without significant subversion, and some descriptive language feels ornate rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaborate phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
