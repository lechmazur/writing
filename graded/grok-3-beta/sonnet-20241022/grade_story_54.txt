<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's even-tempered nature and systematic rebellion are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve hunting techniques feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the offloading action driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit, and the connection between beginning and end lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting on Europa is evocative and ties well to the tone of elegant chaos; sensory details like faded banners and stuffed animals enhance atmosphere, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has moments of impact with imagery and subtext around rebellion and preservation, but the emotional resonance is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of vibrations of intent is unique, the story leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, and emotional depth lacks nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; creative thinking is evident, yet the style lacks the polish for top-tier publication, leaving only a mild lingering impression.</comment>
