<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's dutiful nature as a sentinel is clear, but his internal conflict and motivation lack depth and nuance; his centuries-long role feels stated rather than felt, missing a distinct personal voice or emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and implied end, driven by the impending experiment, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the wedding and Marcus's mission is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The photosynthesis lab setting is vividly rendered with green-tinted light and algae tanks, enhancing the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse beyond visuals, and the wedding's tone occasionally jars with the primal undertones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension through Marcus's looming decision, with some effective imagery like the "kill switch," but the ending feels predictable, and subtext about consciousness in plants lacks deeper exploration; emotions are more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of sentient plants is intriguing, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like "impossible dawns" are evocative but not entirely fresh, and emotional resonance feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of the lab and wedding, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering question about ethics in science, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
