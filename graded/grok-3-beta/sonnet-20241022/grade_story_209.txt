<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seasoned woodsman’s motivation to map abandoned railways is clear and tied to personal loss, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; reactions to the hairbrush are poignant yet underdeveloped in revealing broader traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, connecting personal loss to discovery, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like "metal flowers" and "humming signals," enhancing atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and timeframe feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the dual loss of family and mystery, with strong imagery like "electromagnetic lullaby"; yet, the ending feels more conclusive than lingering, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping railways via echoes is original, some metaphors like "metal flowers" verge on cliché without subversion; emotional nuance is shown but occasionally stated, lacking consistent depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the hairbrush as antenna, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering sadness, though not a profound question or thought.</comment>
