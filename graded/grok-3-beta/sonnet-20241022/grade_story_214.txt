<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to grief and legacy is clear, but Marcus lacks a distinct voice or deeper complexity beyond his obsession; reactions to the sea glass feel predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the black hole discovery lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting on Titan’s methane sea and floating observatory is vividly rendered and enhances the isolation motif; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through grief and discovery, with some effective symbolism in the sea glass; however, the ending feels slightly pat, and subtext is underdeveloped for a truly impactful theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality in combining sci-fi with personal loss, some descriptions (e.g., “empty spaces in his heart”) lean on cliché; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, contained narrative.</comment>
