<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's empathic nature as a blacksmith is evident in his gentle care for the dollhouses and spirits, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes or conflict beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly uneven, with the ghost child’s agitation resolved too quickly, missing deeper tension or escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like moonlight on stained glass, enhancing the eerie yet tender atmosphere, though some sensory elements remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through Marcus’s connection with the spirits and effective imagery, but the theme of preserved humanity feels somewhat stated rather than deeply shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a blacksmith in a haunted museum is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “trapped stars”) feel slightly overused, and emotional depth occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a poignant vignette, falling short of top-tier impact.</comment>
