<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The orchard keeper's immortality and motivation to restore the ecosystem are clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond bitter resignation; her reactions to the earbud cover feel symbolic yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the launch action driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some causal links between ink patterns and coordinates are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden setting is vividly realized and complements the tone of bitter irony, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., painted-over history), but the ending feels more abrupt than satisfying, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of quantum agriculture is original, some metaphors (e.g., ink as tea leaves) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance leans on explicit bitterness rather than subtle subtext, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
