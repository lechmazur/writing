<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Darius’s morose nature and past as a seamster are intriguing, but his shift from despair to purpose feels too abrupt and lacks nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the blackout and ancient systems driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of the discovery’s implications.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild wonder through the cosmic reveal, but literary devices like symbolism (needle as purpose) are underdeveloped; dialogue feels functional but not particularly natural or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of transforming stars offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about transformation, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
