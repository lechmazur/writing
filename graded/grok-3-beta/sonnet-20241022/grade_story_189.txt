<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to decode star maps is clear, but her personality as a "bright-eyed apprentice" feels underdeveloped; her actions lack depth beyond curiosity, and her voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of overcharging machinery driving the climax, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and some cause-effect links (like the sudden lighthouse beam) are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-water war timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like dusty shelves and humming energy, though the tone of "brazen calm" occasionally clashes with the eerie setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its first-contact theme, and the ending is purposeful, but it lacks emotional depth or subtext; literary devices like the star map holograms are visually striking but not symbolically rich.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in combining ancient star maps with a futuristic lighthouse purpose, but it leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion; sensory details are specific yet not always nuanced, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the phone booth key, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate descriptions; it leaves a lingering thought of humanity's redemption, though not powerfully so.</comment>
