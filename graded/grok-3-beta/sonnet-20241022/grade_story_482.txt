<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's insomnia and obsession with capturing the wizard's essence are well-defined, but her deeper personality and voice feel underdeveloped beyond her grief and determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels slightly rushed within the word limit; the connection between scrying and painting as methods of discovery lacks deeper integration.</comment>
