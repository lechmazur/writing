<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's analytical nature and reluctance as a caretaker are clear, shaping her actions, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped; her voice lacks distinctiveness despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the unlocking of secrets driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The futuristic setting and hidden sunrise blend well, enhancing the melancholic tone; sensory details like "chronological nectar" are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel secondary to plot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a quantum orchard is original, some metaphors (e.g., "gleeful ache") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about loss and restoration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
