<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Sarah Chen's motivation to decode temple inscriptions is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the bleary-eyed physician trope; her internal conflict between science and mysticism feels surface-level and lacks a distinct voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The digital nomad camp setting and dawn timeframe are evocatively described with sensory details like the surf and sunlight, enhancing the quietly dramatic tone, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character depth.</comment>
