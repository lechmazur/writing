<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's daydreaming nature is hinted at but underdeveloped; her motivation to uncover a transformative truth feels clear but lacks depth in personal stakes or emotional nuance, making her character somewhat generic despite the intriguing premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to revelation is coherent within the word limit, with the decoding action driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration of the breakthrough moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The submerged palace and post-glacial timeframe create a haunting atmosphere that enhances the story's tone of pristine chaos; sensory details like waterlogged walls are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and hope, with symbolism in the coded marks as empathy, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch to linger with the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of coded compassion is original, the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes of ancient messages without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the satellite fragment, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of hope, though not deeply felt due to surface-level execution.</comment>
