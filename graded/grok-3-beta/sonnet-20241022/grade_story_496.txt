<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's repressed nature and secret terror are well-integrated into his actions, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual buildup to fully justify the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the ambush driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks nuance, leaning on a sudden epiphany rather than earned progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown urban setting is vividly described with sensory details like gravel crunch and kudzu vines, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly tied to the cosmic theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and unease through symbolism (perfume bottle as legacy and art) and a haunting ending, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict resolves too neatly, missing deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of writing on skin is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "morning mist") feel generic, and the narrative occasionally relies on stated emotions rather than showing nuanced reactions, hinting at a lack of full originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
