<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Sir Edmund’s internal conflict over mercy and duty shaping his weathered persona, but his motivation lacks deeper nuance beyond the surface regret; his voice, while reflective, feels somewhat generic for a knight archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—introspection overshadows action, and the connection between past choices and present realization isn’t fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like crashing waves and salt-crusted mirrors, effectively enhancing the mood of isolation and regret; however, the timeframe within reflections feels underutilized as a narrative device.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a contemplative emotional response through symbolism of patterns and mirrors, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict of choice feels more stated than shown, lacking visceral tension; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on impossible choices, some metaphors (e.g., constellation of choices) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often explicitly stated rather than subtly shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the lighthouse and regret, leaving a lingering question about choice, but the style occasionally leans toward overwrought language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
