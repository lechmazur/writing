<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's loyalty as a scout is clear, but his inner conflict and motivation for meditation feel underdeveloped and somewhat generic; his voice lacks distinctiveness despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the blackout and coded messages driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between meditation and moth observation is not fully coherent or logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and blackout setting create a striking atmosphere of isolation and mystery, enhanced by sensory details like creaking wind and moth shadows, though the tone of sanctified dread occasionally feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some reflection on inner peace and duality, with decent use of symbolism (moths as thoughts), but the ending lacks punch, and the comedy routines disrupt emotional impact rather than enhance subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of coded comedy routines is original, but the execution relies on somewhat predictable metaphors (storm inside, moths as chaos); emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the tower and journal, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
