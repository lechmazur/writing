<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's jovial nature and precarious confidence are evident, but his deeper emotional layers and motivations feel underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking nuanced dialogue or internal conflict to fully flesh out his voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between capturing shadows and the metronome method lacks deeper logical grounding, making the resolution feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The attic setting and late afternoon timeframe are evocative and enhance the mood of desperation, with sensory details like creaking stairs and cobwebbed windows adding immersion, though the atmosphere could tie more directly to the shadow concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's loss and determination, with some effective imagery like shadows as black smoke, but the ending lacks a deeper punch, and the theme of taming darkness feels surface-level without richer subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of capturing shadows is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat predictable tropes of loss and heroism without significant subversion; metaphors like "water down a drain" are functional but not strikingly original, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, contained narrative; the style is clear but not distinctive enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
