<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s fierce apathy is well-portrayed and shapes his initial resignation, but his sudden shift to defiance feels slightly unearned without deeper internal conflict shown within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc from apathy to decision, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the meteor shower’s role in driving the resolution lacks sufficient buildup to feel fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating monastery and perpetual twilight create a striking, immersive atmosphere, with vivid imagery of drifting earth and meteors; however, sensory details beyond sight are underutilized, missing opportunities to deepen the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through the theme of letting go, with strong symbolism in the meteors, but the ending feels more predictable than profound, and the conflict’s resolution lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, the emotional arc relies on somewhat generic descriptors of loneliness and defiance, lacking nuanced subtext or fresh metaphors to elevate it beyond a familiar narrative pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate brevity, and the elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally leans on obvious imagery, missing a deeper lingering impact or truly innovative thought.</comment>
