<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor Blackwood’s graciousness and solemn absurdity shape her actions, but her motivation to defy the gods feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes beyond the postcards’ influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the postcards driving action, but pacing feels uneven; the resolution arrives too abruptly within the word limit, diminishing the buildup’s impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fog-shrouded orchard district is vividly rendered with sensory details like metallic petals chiming, enhancing the eerie yet hopeful atmosphere, though the timeframe “between meals” feels underutilized in setting depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance with symbolism of metal flowers blooming, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch; dialogue is minimal but natural, though subtext could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of forging impossible tools from postcards is original, some imagery (e.g., “skeletal branches”) feels familiar; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the forge and postcards, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
