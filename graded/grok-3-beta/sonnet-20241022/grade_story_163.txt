<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the fragmented reality concept drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The xenobiology station and Jupiter’s cloud migration create a vivid backdrop that enhances the mood of reckless precision, though sensory details are sparse and the atmosphere doesn’t fully deepen character motivation.</comment>
