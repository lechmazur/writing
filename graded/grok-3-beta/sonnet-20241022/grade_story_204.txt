<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as a professional cuddler shapes her personality and motivations, revealing vulnerability through her shame about societal prejudice, but her inner growth feels slightly underdeveloped due to limited dialogue and internal reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between Maya's profession and the ticket punch drives the story, though cause-effect links are not always deeply explored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar setting is vividly described and enhances the tone of ancient novelty, with sensory details like hovering displays and holoscreens creating immersion, though some atmospheric elements feel secondary to the character interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the theme of human connection, with effective symbolism in the ticket punch, but the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; the ending is satisfying but not deeply memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in linking professional cuddling to historical care, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., gravity as connection) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not consistently shown through action over exposition.</comment>
