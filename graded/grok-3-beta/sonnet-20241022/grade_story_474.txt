<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as a radio host channeling the dead is intriguing, but her personal stakes and emotional depth remain underdeveloped. Her motivation to preserve diversity emerges late and feels somewhat imposed rather than organic to her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, especially in revealing the nightmare's nature. Cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows create a vivid, eerie atmosphere that complements the tone and concept of diversity among spirits. Sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion; the setting supports the action well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of diversity, and the chessboard symbolism is effective. However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness. Subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining supernatural elements with a radio broadcast, but some metaphors (e.g., chess pieces as individuals) feel familiar and slightly overused. Emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style occasionally leans toward over-explanation, hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering thought about diversity, but the impact is not profound.</comment>
