<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's restlessness and deceptive nature are present, but his motivation feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional nuance; his voice is indistinct, and reactions to the lantern don't fully reveal complex inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times; the lantern's role in driving the story is logical, though cause-effect links between visions and designs are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Mars biodome setting is vividly rendered and enhances the story's tension; sensory details like artificial light and dust storms are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized; atmosphere supports the cautious tone well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Marcus's struggle, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable literary devices; the ending is satisfying but predictable, and conflict resolution feels too neat for the stakes implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of ghostly designs is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion; sensory details are somewhat generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the lantern, but lacks lingering depth or profound questions; style is clear but unremarkable, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
