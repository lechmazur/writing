<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a strong beginning and haunting resolution, driven by riddles and the sundial's mystery, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat of emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The disused railway station and ivy create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like the sundial's hum and ghostly figures, perfectly supporting the tone and concept of forgotten time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of loss and memory through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, though the central theme of preservation could be deepened beyond surface exploration.</comment>
