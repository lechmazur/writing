<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Professor Blackwood's motivation to solve the riddle is clear, but his personality as an old-fashioned mage feels underdeveloped beyond surface traits like antiquated robes; his actions lack deeper insight into his character or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the riddle's resolution tied to reflections and children's play, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between reflections and hieroglyph changes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse setting is vividly realized with sensory details and contrasts effectively with the tropical ecosystem, enhancing the tone of sanctified dread, though the connection between setting and object feels somewhat incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild wonder through the interplay of innocence and mystery, with strong imagery of mirrors and reflections, but lacks deeper emotional resonance or subtext; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mirrors and riddles offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but emotions are more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length suits the mysterious tone, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, surface-level narrative.</comment>
