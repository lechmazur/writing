<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Miranda's motivation to face fear is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her actions align with the motivation, yet her voice and nuanced traits remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical flow from entry to discovery, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted mansion setting and twilight timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like dust-draped chandeliers and whining dogs; however, the tone occasionally overplays the eerie without grounding contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes unease and curiosity with effective imagery and subtext about silent agreements, but the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks a sharper resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique take on silent pacts, some metaphors (e.g., "truths bloom in darkness") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on atmosphere than nuanced character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but not a profound question.</comment>
