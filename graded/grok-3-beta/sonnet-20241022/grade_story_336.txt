<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Darius's weariness and role as an undertaker are evident, but his deeper motivations and personality lack nuance; his dedication feels stated rather than shown through unique reactions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of imprisoning spirits driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Persian palace and modern elements blend well, creating a vivid atmosphere with strong sensory details like holographic tapestries; however, the tone's contrast with the concept feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Darius's pride, with decent imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is satisfying but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining elements, the emotional depth feels surface-level, and metaphors like "shepherd collecting strays" are somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought.</comment>
