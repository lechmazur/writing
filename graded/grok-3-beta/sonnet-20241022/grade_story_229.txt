<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eleanor's drive to honor her grandmother's promise, but her personality lacks depth beyond the quest; her voice and reactions feel somewhat generic despite the unique context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between rain patterns and the ship discovery, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the revelation, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ship graveyard setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "brackish water" and "rotting hulls," enhancing the atmosphere of loss and discovery; tone aligns well with the cosmic theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on memory and love through subtext, and the ending is purposeful, but dialogue feels expository rather than natural, and emotional impact is somewhat diluted by overt telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of rain pattern tracking is original, some metaphors like "ghosts of ships" feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like rain patterns, leaving a lingering thought on memory, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
