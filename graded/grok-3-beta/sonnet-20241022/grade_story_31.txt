<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters Mai and Lily are distinct, with Mai's solemnity and Lily's tech-savvy nature well-defined, but their motivations feel slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuance in their reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and cohesive with a satisfying resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat to fully savor the emotional reunion; cause and effect are logical but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk rooftop garden setting is vividly realized with strong sensory details like "neon-streaked shadows" and "pixel-perfect blossoms," enhancing the atmosphere of loss and connection; tone complements the concept beautifully, though some sensory elements feel slightly repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the mother-daughter bridge and uses effective imagery like "soil into silicon," with a satisfying ending; however, dialogue feels sparse and subtext, while present, could be more subtly woven to deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on cyberpunk and family connection, some metaphors like "forest of connections" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, lacking the raw nuance expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the digital-real tree network, leaving a lingering thought about heritage and evolution; however, the style occasionally leans on predictable phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
