<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prince Aldrich's motivation to cure loneliness is clear, and his transformation from exiled royal to a keeper of transitions is intriguing, but his personality lacks depth and distinct voice; reactions feel somewhat predictable for a royal in exile.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between grinding memories and transformation is not fully fleshed out logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a vivid, isolating atmosphere that complements the theme of loneliness, with strong sensory details like snowflakes and pine needles; however, the setting's potential to deepen the narrative is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of transformation, with effective symbolism in the mortar and pestle, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict of loneliness lacks sharper tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of grinding memories is original, the exiled prince trope feels familiar without significant subversion; emotional resonance is present but relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and some metaphors like "stardust" are overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the mortar and pestle, and it leaves a lingering thought about transformation, but the style occasionally leans toward over-simplicity, missing opportunities for deeper impact within the brief length.</comment>
