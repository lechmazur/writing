<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a preservationist and rebel is clear and consistent, driving her actions in the story, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single trait, and her dialogue feels somewhat expository rather than revealing nuanced character voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between Maya's actions and the ghostly presence's responses could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms are evocatively described, enhancing the atmosphere with sensory details like damp stone and thunder, though the setting's connection to Maya's motivation could be more deeply integrated beyond surface-level preservation themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Maya's confessions and the ghostly partnership, with some effective imagery, but the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the theme of preservation lacks deeper subtext or layers beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a somewhat fresh take on ghostly guardianship, it leans on familiar haunted house tropes without significant subversion, and some descriptions, like the shifting passage, feel slightly generic rather than uniquely vivid or personal to the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, leaving a lingering sense of partnership, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper exploration.</comment>
