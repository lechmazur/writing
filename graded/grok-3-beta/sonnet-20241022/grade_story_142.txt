<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Constance's motivation to recover lost recipes is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "broke aristocrat" trope; her actions align with her goal, yet her voice and reactions feel somewhat generic and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; connections between actions and concepts are logical, though not always compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like spectral giggling and rusted metal creaks, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; it strongly supports the story's tone and concept, though some connections to character motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its themes of legacy and loss, with some effective imagery like "reality bent at the edges"; however, the ending feels more functional than impactful, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel timelines and culinary magic offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "skeletal frame") are overused; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
