<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Marcus's groggy brewer persona is somewhat distinct, but his motivation to embody his values feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; his reactions and voice are inconsistent, wavering between flippant and serious without clear grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the protest lull and the haunted mansion feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions, and the action of initiating a brew lacks strong causal links to the broader narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting and protest timeframe are evocative and complement the encroaching darkness concept, with some effective sensory details like dust and hops; however, the atmosphere only sporadically supports Marcusâ€™s motivation, missing deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with brewing as a metaphor for creativity, but it lacks emotional resonance and a satisfying ending; dialogue feels forced, and while some imagery is present, the central conflict is weak and the theme of embodying values remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story shows glimmers of originality in combining brewing with supernatural elements, but relies heavily on haunted mansion tropes without subversion; metaphors like "darkness as stout" are overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion despite creative element integration; the style is occasionally engaging but lacks clarity and depth; the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is minimal due to underdeveloped themes.</comment>
