<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's streetwise nature shapes her actions and survival instincts effectively, but her deeper motivations and personal voice remain underdeveloped, lacking distinct emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed transitions; cause and effect are logical, yet the story lacks tighter coherence in connecting beginning to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lost orchard temple setting is evocative with strong sensory details like fruit-laden vines, enhancing the mood, though the timeframe's integration feels somewhat abstract and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through symbolism of the brooch and temple, but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; the theme of hope from darkness is clear yet lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in combining elements, it leans on familiar tropes of cursed objects and hidden temples without significant subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful for a top-tier publication.</comment>
