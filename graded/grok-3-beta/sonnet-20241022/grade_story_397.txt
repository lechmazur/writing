<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's jadedness as a bartender is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation shifts intriguingly to a sense of purpose, though it lacks grounding in personal history or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the time travel revelation feels abrupt and underexplained, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with a rushed climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of scientific mystery; sensory details like refracted fireworks light are evocative, though some tonal shifts feel inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and some emotional resonance through Marcus's realization, with strong symbolism in the cocktails and crystals; however, the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise of time-traveling scientists is original, the execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors like "time pivoting" are somewhat generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the doodles and laboratory, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
