<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map trade routes is clear and tied to the unique ability to read leaves, but the wandering orchardist lacks a distinct personal voice or deeper emotional complexity beyond the bittersweet sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the map's sudden revelation, and cause-effect links between leaf patterns and route mapping are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underwater city hall setting is vividly described with sensory details like iridescent fish and salt water, enhancing the atmosphere, though the tone occasionally overplays bittersweet nostalgia at the expense of grit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the grandmother's phantom touch and the sealed-off garden, with strong imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a lingering central conflict; the ending feels poignant yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of leaf-based cartography is original, some metaphors (e.g., "light touch of love") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated loss than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like leaves and the multiverse, but the style occasionally leans on ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
