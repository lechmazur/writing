<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's naivety as a gambler shapes his willingness to engage with Thaddeus, but his deeper motivations and personal growth feel underdeveloped; the transformation into a mathematics professor lacks sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a poignant ending, but the pacing feels uneven within the word limit; some events, like the solstice realization, are rushed, weakening cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative and ties well to the themes of chaos and tides, with sensory details like turbine hums enhancing atmosphere; however, the candlelit aspect feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the mentor-student bond and Thaddeus's decline, with some effective symbolism in candles as time markers; yet, the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the brief format.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on chaos and mentorship, it leans on predictable tropes of the "mad genius" without fully subverting them; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with a lingering emotional impact, and the elements are generally in service of the narrative; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
