<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's gloomy nature and obsession with lost lullabies are clear, but his deeper personality and emotional nuance remain underdeveloped; motivation feels consistent but lacks depth beyond the surface obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy exposition; cause and effect are logical, though the story's resolution lacks a strong climactic moment or shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The resonance testing facility setting is vividly realized with sensory details like humming frequencies and aching teeth; atmosphere strongly supports the tone of haggard awe and enhances Marcus's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (bone fruits, crystallized songs) evoke thought and emotion; subtext about preserving the eternal is present, though the ending feels more descriptive than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of crafting artificial fruits from sound waves is original, but some metaphors (e.g., "membrane between was and will be") feel overwrought; emotional resonance is shown but occasionally stated explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language that hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
