<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s curse of speaking only truth shapes his conflict well, but his internal struggle lacks depth; motivation feels surface-level despite clear reactions to the curse. His voice is distinct but not fully nuanced in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; petrification drives the story, yet some cause-effect links (like the sudden transformation) are abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone and complements the concept of layered truths; sensory details like crimson feathers and grimy windows are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on truth and compassion, with strong symbolism in the tapestry and petrification; however, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and emotional depth is more told than shown, weakening impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the tapestry and petrification offer originality, some metaphors (e.g., “cruelty dressed in honesty’s clothing”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but not consistently deep, and tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the moon phases and tapestry, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought on truth, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
