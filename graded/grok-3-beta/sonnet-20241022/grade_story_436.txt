<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meridian's sorrowful nature as an apothecary is evident, and her motivation to restore the Oracle's voice aligns with her role, but her personality lacks depth beyond the immediate task; her reactions and actions are consistent but not particularly revealing of a unique voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with decoding dream catchers driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are logical yet predictable, missing a sharper twist or deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating fortress and desert setting are vividly described and enhance the tone of painful joy, with sensory details like heat ripples and humming fortress adding immersion, though the connection between setting and object (plastic spoon) feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Meridian's tears and family memories, with effective symbolism in dream catchers, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly memorable impact; subtext is present but not fully layered, and conflict resolution feels slightly underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding dream catchers is original, some metaphors (e.g., "frozen starlight") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable exile tropes without subversion, limiting uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like dream catchers and tears, leaving a lingering sense of hope and loss, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
