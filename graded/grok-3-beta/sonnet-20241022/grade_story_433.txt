<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's hardheadedness and brokenness are clear motivators, but his inner transformation lacks depth and nuance; his voice feels somewhat generic despite the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution leans on exposition rather than organic development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of grief and supernatural quests without significant subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
