<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to track magical language evolution is clear and aligns with her role as an understudy sorcerer, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "obnoxiously polite" trait, which is more performative than revealing. Her voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (unauthorized entry), middle (research), and end (escape), but pacing feels rushed at the conclusion. The concept of waking unheard voices drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague, like the oak sliver's sudden harmonization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly realized and enhances the action of eavesdropping, with sensory details like humming formations creating atmosphere. However, the connection between setting and timeframe (laundry cycles) feels contrived, and the tone of playful dread is inconsistently sustained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on forgotten knowledge, with some subtext about cyclical history, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level character reactions. Imagery (crystalline frequencies) is effective, yet the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, and dialogue is overly formal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of salt crystals recording voices is original, and the story avoids overt clich√©s, but sensory details are occasionally generic (e.g., "chill down her spine"). Emotional nuance is present but stated rather than shown, and the narrative tone wavers, lacking a fully individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the salt chamber and whispers, leaving a lingering question about the crystals listening back. However, the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and style occasionally obscures clarity with ornate phrasing.</comment>
