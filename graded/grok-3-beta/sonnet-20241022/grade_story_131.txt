<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's aloofness as an orphan is well-portrayed through her emotional detachment, but her transformation feels slightly abrupt given the depth of her established barriers; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced layering in her internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from detachment to acceptance is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution; the gravitational anomaly drives the plot symbolically but isn't fully integrated into the action's causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates a unique atmosphere and complements the tone of detachment, but sensory details are sparse beyond the humming and glowing stones, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in the surreal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maya's grief and uses strong symbolism with the stones, but the ending feels overly neat, lacking lingering tension; subtext is present but not fully explored due to explicit narration of themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of glowing stones and gravitational anomalies is original, the emotional journey relies on familiar grief tropes without subversion; metaphors are evocative but occasionally predictable, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overexplains, hindering subtlety; it leaves a lingering feeling of transformation, though not a particularly unique or profound one.</comment>
