<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The diplomat's confusion and evolving perspective are portrayed with some depth, particularly through her attachment to the spare key as a symbol of rigid thinking, but her motivations lack specificity and her voice feels somewhat generic, missing a distinct personal tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc from relocation to preservation, with the action of liberalizing policies driving a resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed transitions between surface and underground, and some cause-effect links remain vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with crystalline, tear-like walls, enhancing the atmosphere of hidden wisdom, and sensory details like the sparkling caverns immerse the reader, though the bus ride timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on societal structures through the starling metaphor and salt mine community, with strong imagery and subtext about freedom versus order, but the emotional impact is diluted by a lack of specific character reactions, and the ending feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a starling-inspired society offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., salt dissolving) feel overused, and the diplomatâ€™s transformation lacks nuanced emotional depth, occasionally relying on stated rather than shown feelings; the narrative tone is consistent but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with a thoughtful blend of elements like the key and birds, leaving a lingering question about societal harmony, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
