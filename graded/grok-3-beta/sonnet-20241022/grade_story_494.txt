<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from arrogance to humility is evident, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit; the shift lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance beyond regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the restoration of the wards; cause and effect are logical, yet the action's impact is somewhat diminished by brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master's courtyard enhances the mystical atmosphere effectively, and sensory details like the fluttering tapestry are evocative; however, deeper sensory immersion across all senses is missing to fully ground the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus's redemption and uses imagery well (e.g., light blooming like ink in water), but the central conflict feels resolved too neatly; subtext is present but not deeply layered for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a personal take on redemption, some metaphors (e.g., shackles of potential) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, but the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, contained narrative.</comment>
