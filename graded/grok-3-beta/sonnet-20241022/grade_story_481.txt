<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's role as a perceptive cartographer shapes his actions, but his motivation feels somewhat generic and lacks depth; the distant intimacy is present but not fully explored in his personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of convincing the board driving the resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital ward is vividly rendered with sensory details like the antiseptic hum and mechanical clangs, enhancing the atmosphere of corruption, though the timeframe of the balloon moment feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response through Marcus's reflections and the dragonfly imagery, with a discernible theme of lost innocence, but the ending feels more poignant than fully satisfying, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique blend of cartography and futuristic corruption, some metaphors (dragonfly wings as innocence) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the neural map and forge, leaving a lingering sense of loss, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
