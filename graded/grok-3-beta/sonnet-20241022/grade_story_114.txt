<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's apathy and hidden dedication are intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift from indifference to purpose lacks depth and emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of unfolding dreams driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dream recording studio and divine timeframe blend well, with evocative sensory details like the scent of salt water; however, the atmosphere could more consistently support Marcus's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its resurrection theme and has satisfying symbolism with the coffee grinder, but subtext is uneven, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the coffee grinder, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
