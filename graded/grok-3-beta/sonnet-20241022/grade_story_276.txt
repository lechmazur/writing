<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The emissary's unease and alien perspective are well-portrayed through her actions and interactions, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes beyond the mission. Her distinct voice as an outsider is present but not fully unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on metaphors while key transitions are rushed. Cause and effect are logical, though the narrative coherence is occasionally disrupted by overly poetic tangents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is vividly integrated and enhances the story's mood of cosmic responsibility. Sensory details are present but inconsistent—some are evocative, others generic. The atmosphere supports the theme, though the tone occasionally wavers between profound and overly whimsical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through shared picnics and mutual understanding, with effective use of metaphors like debris as redemption. However, the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict of guiding humanity lacks sharp tension. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh perspective on cosmic connection, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., sandwich crumbs as meteoroids) feel forced and overly ornate. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, yet the tone shifts slightly, and some descriptors are predictable rather than vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, though not fully optimized. It leaves a lingering thought about universal patterns, but the style occasionally overreaches with complexity, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
