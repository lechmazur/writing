<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's ghostly nature and motivation to preserve ancient traditions are clear, but the character lacks depth or personal conflict; their voice, while distinct, feels more atmospheric than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a cyclical coherence with a clear ritual arc, but the action of flinging the whistle feels somewhat contrived, and pacing is uneven with overly dense imagery slowing the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting and midnight timeframe create a compelling, eerie atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like salt-crusted windows and whale songs; however, the connection between setting and object feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a haunting mood and uses strong symbolism (lighthouse beam, dancer’s light), with a satisfying cyclical ending; yet, the central conflict lacks sharpness, and emotional depth is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique ghostly perspective and avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (sea foam, barnacles) feel overused, and emotional resonance leans on explicit description rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
