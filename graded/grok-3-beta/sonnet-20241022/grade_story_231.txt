<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Enlil-nasir's sentimental nature and spontaneous attribute are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to restore justice feels clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance or personal stakes beyond the grandmother's influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the coordinates and the final revelation lacks sufficient buildup or tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ancient Sumerian palace setting is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the chaotic humility or the price of justice concept beyond surface mentions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and theme of justice, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; dialogue feels purposeful but not natural, and deeper subtext is hinted at but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on predictable tropes of hidden heirs and humble heroes without subversion; metaphors are functional but not striking, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the hairpin, but it lacks a lingering impact or depth; the style is clear but unremarkable, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
