<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to uncover the truth behind his daughter’s death is clear and drives his actions, but his personality as a vigilant orchardist feels underdeveloped beyond surface-level patience and methodical nature. His voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue, blending into a generic tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the conspiracy unraveling drives the narrative forward. However, pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between paper planes and the conspiracy resolution is somewhat forced, lacking deeper logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility setting is intriguing and ties to the plot, but sensory details are sparse, failing to fully immerse the reader. The atmosphere supports the sardonic tone to an extent, but the orchard and peacock imagery feel disconnected from the primary setting, diluting the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus’s quest for justice, and the peacock pattern metaphor adds some depth. However, the ending feels predictable, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow. Subtext is present but not fully layered, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story shows some originality in combining paper planes and peacock patterns, but it leans on familiar conspiracy tropes without significant subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh, but emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts slightly, lacking consistent individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate. However, the style occasionally hinders clarity with overworked imagery, and while there’s a lingering sense of justice, the narrative lacks profound depth or a truly memorable takeaway.</comment>
