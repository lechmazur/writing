<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's portrayal as a homeless philosopher-king is intriguing, and his motivation to solve the labyrinth is clear, but his earnestly frivolous nature feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the kaleidoscope and confetti proposals driving the resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between betrayal and current actions is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns is vividly described and enhances the mystical atmosphere, supporting Marcus's motivation, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
