<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's ability to see ghosts shapes his empathetic personality, but his motivation to help them find peace feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution. His elegantly clumsy attribute is mentioned but not vividly shown in action. His voice is distinct yet not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the action of dissecting ghost stories feels tangential to the central repair task. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional beats at the end. Coherence is maintained, though the connection between elements feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is an intriguing setting that enhances the ghostly atmosphere, and the dissonance of silence at midday is effectively eerie. Sensory details like whispers and humidity control hums are evocative, though more varied sensory immersion could elevate the mood further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's gesture with the flower crown, and the theme of letting go is clear, but subtext and deeper meaning are only surface-level. Dialogue is purposeful but sparse. The ending is satisfying yet lacks a profound punch. Showing versus telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique premise with the ghost-seeing technician, avoiding overt clichés, but emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced at times. Metaphors like the flower crown as a bridge are fresh but not fully explored. The style is individual yet occasionally leans on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, though some feel more in service of the premise than the narrative depth. The brief length feels deliberate but limits emotional impact. There’s creative thinking in combining ghosts and sand castles, but the lingering thought is not as strong as it could be.</comment>
