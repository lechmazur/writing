<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's dual role as chef and investigator is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth beyond the discovery; reactions to the pencil eraser and stick feel utilitarian rather than revealing of personal stakes or nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of subverting seismic science drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links between ancient predictions and modern events are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility setting enhances the concept of seismic discovery, and sensory details like kitchen sounds and trembling ground are vivid, but the atmosphere of frenzied tranquility is inconsistently conveyed across scenes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about time and prediction, with effective metaphors like mille-feuille for layered time, but the ending feels more abrupt than satisfying, and emotional depth is told rather than shown through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of ancient earthquake predictions is original, the execution relies on predictable "hidden knowledge" tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced showing over stating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is more intellectual than emotional.</comment>
