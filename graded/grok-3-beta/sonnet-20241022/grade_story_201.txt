<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's impulsiveness as a performer is evident in her actions, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced layers beyond the family legend.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a logical flow from mystery to revelation, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and dusk setting are vividly described with sensory details like the waterfall's roar, enhancing the mystical atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marina's realization and uses imagery effectively, but the ending feels slightly predictable; subtext about creativity as a blessing is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on a curse as a gift, some metaphors (e.g., "trapped butterfly") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about artistic legacy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
