<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ming Wei's dual role as assassin and herbalist is intriguing, and her calm demeanor shapes her actions, but her motivations lack depth beyond surface-level irony; her voice is distinct yet underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the prophecy and poisoning scheme driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and some connections, like the duck conspiracy, are more whimsical than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of intrigue; sensory details are present but sparse; the tone of humorous unease complements the setting, though it occasionally undercuts tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending assassination with botany and prophecy, but relies on somewhat predictable palace intrigue tropes; metaphors are fresh at times, though emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the botanical press and butterfly pattern, but the style occasionally prioritizes cleverness over clarity; it leaves a lingering question about fate, though depth is limited.</comment>
