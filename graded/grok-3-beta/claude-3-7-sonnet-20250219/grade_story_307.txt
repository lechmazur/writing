<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's quietly rebellious nature shapes her actions, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; her personal stakes in the neighborhood's preservation lack depth beyond a general guardianship role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but the connection between the DVD's affirmations and Mira's actions feels somewhat contrived; pacing is adequate but rushed at the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fairy light repair shop and twilight timeframe create a compelling atmosphere of ethereal grit, enhanced by sensory details like flickering signs; however, the parade aftermath setting feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of quiet rebellion, and the symbolism of light against darkness is effective; yet, the ending lacks a deeper punch, and subtext feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of coded fairy lights is original, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of community resistance without fully subverting them; emotional nuance is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the DVD and fairy lights, but it lacks a lingering impact or profound depth; the style supports clarity but doesn't elevate the narrative to exceptional heights.</comment>
