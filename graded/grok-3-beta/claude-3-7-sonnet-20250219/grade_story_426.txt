<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Markus's motivation to preserve folk medicines is clear, but his personality as a "secretive pathfinder" feels underdeveloped; his actions align with the goal but lack depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the hacking method, while creative, isn't fully integrated into the narrative's momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative and enhances the secretive tone, with sensory details like creaking floorboards and moonlight adding atmosphere, though the connection between the teapot and setting feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on stolen knowledge and healing, with a central conflict present, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level showing of feelings; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hacking method and setting offer originality, and the narrative avoids overt clich√©s, but emotional resonance lacks nuance, and some descriptors (e.g., "aloof passion") feel generic rather than vivid or specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-explained concepts; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profound one, suggesting moderate depth.</comment>
