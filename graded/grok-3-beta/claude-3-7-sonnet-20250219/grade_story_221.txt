<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation to connect with her past and her mother is clear, and her role as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer shapes her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond grief and melancholy, resulting in a somewhat one-dimensional voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and the connection between the action of arousing spirits and the broader narrative feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly described with sensory details like peeling paint and salt air, enhancing the melancholic tone, though the connection between the setting and the amber object feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Eliza's grief and resolution, with some effective symbolism (amber, thawing heart), but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict lacks sharpness, relying heavily on stated emotions rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with the ghost-whispering wreck-diver, it leans on predictable tropes of grief and closure without fully subverting them, and some metaphors (e.g., "thawing heart") feel overused and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with overly ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is present but not profound enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
