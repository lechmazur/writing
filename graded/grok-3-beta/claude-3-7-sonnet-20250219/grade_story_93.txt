<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's obsession with sacred geometry, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single trait; Mira's role feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the connection between butterfly migration and labyrinth design is intriguing yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive setting is evocative and ties to the concept, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere and immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has potential for emotional impact with unspoken bonds, but relies too much on telling rather than showing; dialogue is purposeful but not particularly natural or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining labyrinths with natural patterns, but the narrative leans on predictable romantic tension and lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but lacks a lingering depth or profound takeaway; style is clear but not distinctive enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
