<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters like Miguel and Professor Alvarez are sketched with potential, but their motivations feel surface-level and lack depth; Miguel's reverence and the professor's whimsy are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels uneven, with the central conflict of the temple's closure introduced abruptly and resolved too vaguely through a hopeful suggestion rather than a concrete resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ancient Aztec temple setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of overlapping worlds, with sensory details like the wind and dust enhancing atmosphere, but the modern city encroachment feels underexplored and lacks vivid contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of preservation and cultural memory, with some effective imagery like the serpent shadow, but the emotional impact is muted by a reliance on telling over showing, and the dialogue feels slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of overlapping worlds offers a fresh angle, the execution leans on predictable tropes of sacred sites and spiritual connection without subversion; some metaphors feel generic, and emotional resonance lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, leaving lingering questions underdeveloped.</comment>
