<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Elias’s optimistically bitter nature influencing his actions, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the surface-level desire for unburdening; his voice feels somewhat generic without distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between the mysterious packages and the resolution remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and foggy atmosphere effectively enhance the mood of isolation and torment, with strong sensory details like the fog’s tendrils; however, the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Elias’s guilt, with some effective imagery like the lighthouse beam, but the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the guilt-ridden lighthouse keeper trope feels familiar without significant subversion; metaphors are decent but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance is present but not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the puzzle box, but it lacks a lingering impact or truly innovative style; the brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
