<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's character as a morbid florist is intriguing, and her neutrally passionate attribute shapes her actions well, but her motivation lacks deeper personal stakes or internal conflict, making her feel somewhat distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of obliging the universe driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between revelations and actions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting is vividly realized and enhances the cosmic tone, with sensory details like flickering lantern light adding atmosphere, though some sensory elements (e.g., smell, touch) are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about cosmic cycles and uses symbolism effectively with death blooms, but the emotional impact is muted due to Elara's neutral demeanor, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist on a floating dojo is original, some descriptions (e.g., "perfect darkness") feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the candle and dojo, leaving a lingering thought about cycles, but the style occasionally leans on exposition, hindering deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
