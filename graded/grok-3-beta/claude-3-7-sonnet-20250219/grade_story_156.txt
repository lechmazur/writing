<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliza's confusion as a diplomat is evident, but her motivations lack depth beyond the surface conflict of diplomacy versus nature's wisdom; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of liberalizing governance ties to the bird patterns, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and some cause-effect links are underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly described with sensory details like crystalline caverns and glowing homes, enhancing the atmosphere, though the bus ride timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Eliza's journey and uses symbolism (spare key, birds), but the conflict resolution feels too neat, and subtext is present but not deeply layered; showing versus telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of nature-inspired governance is original, but some metaphors (birds as governance) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts slightly unnaturally at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the salt mine and birds, leaving a lingering thought about natural systems, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
