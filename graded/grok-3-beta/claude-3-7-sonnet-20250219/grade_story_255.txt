<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seer’s nondescript nature and analytical innovation are intriguing, but their motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional depth; their actions align with the trait, yet the voice remains indistinct and distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with the action of untangling data driving the narrative, and there’s a clear arc within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the relic’s introduction is abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like petrichor; yet, the setting’s connection to the USB drive feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on truth and deception with some effective imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of decoding via rain scent is original, but the narrative leans on familiar seer tropes without subversion; sensory details are vivid yet occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style lacks distinct flair, and the lingering impact is moderate, missing a profound question or feeling.</comment>
