<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Marco's carefree gambler persona and trustworthiness are present but not fully explored in actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice or nuanced motivation beyond surface-level traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between island memories and current actions lacks clarity, diminishing cause-and-effect impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reverse engineering workshop setting is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the characters' motivations or the island mystery's weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is middling; while there is some subtext and a central mystery, emotional resonance is weak, dialogue feels functional rather than natural, and the ending lacks a strong, lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is moderate; the story avoids overt clich√©s but relies on predictable mystery tropes without subversion, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing, lacking a truly unique style or perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated without feeling forced, yet the style lacks flair, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, missing deeper impact.</comment>
