<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Malachi's cynicism and humble arrogance are well-defined and drive his quest for true magic, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the sudden appearance of spectral figures, disrupting the logical flow within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a lighthouse creates a haunting atmosphere that complements the eerie nostalgia, with strong sensory details like the dusty globe and flickering candle, though some elements feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder and reflection through its theme of connection across time, with effective symbolism in the globe, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted and the emotional depth is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of time as magic offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of disillusioned magicians and ghostly apparitions without fully subverting them, and some metaphors feel generic.</comment>
