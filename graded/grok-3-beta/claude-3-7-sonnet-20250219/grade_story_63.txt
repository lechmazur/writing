<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with mending the cylinder as a central action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the emotional climax, and the ripple effect concept is more stated than woven into cause-and-effect dynamics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized with sensory details like humming cylinders and choir echoes, enhancing the atmosphere of preservation, though the timeframe of choir practice feels somewhat incidental rather than integral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clich√©s and offers a unique take on sound preservation, with fresh metaphors like "acoustic tapestry," though some emotional descriptions are more stated than shown, and the style, while distinct, occasionally leans toward ornate phrasing.</comment>
