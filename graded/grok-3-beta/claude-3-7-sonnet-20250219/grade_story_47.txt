<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's dutiful nature as a ward is clear, and her motivation to honor Madame's legacy is consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond her role as a shadow; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and the scavenger hunt structure, while intriguing, lacks tighter cause-and-effect logic in some transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary setting is evocative and enhances the mood of isolation and mystery, with strong sensory details like the silent theater, though the connection between setting and object could be more meaningfully explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Eliza's realization and Madame's vulnerability, with some effective symbolism (the glove), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext, while present, lacks deeper complexity for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the dying mentor trope feels familiar without significant subversion; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuanced subtext, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the voice notes and glove, but the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, and the overall impact, while thoughtful, doesn't linger as powerfully as top-tier work demands.</comment>
