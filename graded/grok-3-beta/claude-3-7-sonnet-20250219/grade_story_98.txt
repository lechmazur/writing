<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's fainthearted nature is evident, but his motivation to learn ancient writings feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper emotional nuance or backstory beyond the grandfather's journals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of drifting eyes drives the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a secret society is not entirely original, the twist of curiosity as initiation offers freshness; however, some metaphors like "heart fluttering like a trapped bird" feel overused, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
