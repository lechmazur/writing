<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s tension as a bodyguard is evident, and his motivation tied to the photograph and past loss is clear, but his internal shift feels abrupt and lacks deeper nuance in dialogue or action to fully reveal his personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from duty to rebellion is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the decision point, and cause-effect links could be more subtly developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly realized and enhances the rebirth theme, with a serene yet tense atmosphere that supports Marcus’s conflict, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus’s shift, with some effective symbolism (flowers, photograph), but dialogue feels functional rather than natural, and the theme of rebirth, while present, lacks deeper subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in the lunar rebellion concept, but emotional handling is more stated than shown, and metaphors like “water through cupped hands” feel somewhat generic rather than striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the greenhouse and photograph, leaving a lingering sense of change, but the style occasionally prioritizes clarity over depth, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
