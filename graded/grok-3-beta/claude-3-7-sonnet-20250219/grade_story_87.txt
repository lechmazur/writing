<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's patience as a librarian shapes her meticulous actions, and her motivation to bury hatred is clear, but her transformation from bitterness to rebellion lacks deeper emotional nuance; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from resentment to action is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between mixtapes and plot resolution is slightly forced, lacking seamless cause-and-effect integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly rendered with sensory details like whirring gears and hissing steam, enhancing the atmosphere, though the setting's connection to the sticker sheet feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eliza's shift to truth-seeking, with some effective imagery (gears, brass), but the conflict resolution feels predictable, and subtext is present but not deeply layered; it shows more than tells, yet lacks a striking style.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the steampunk elements and personal vendetta offer some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of betrayal and redemption without subversion; emotional handling is stated more than nuanced, and some descriptors (e.g., "savage grace") feel ornate and slightly forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with complex phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought of rebellion, though not profoundly memorable or innovative.</comment>
