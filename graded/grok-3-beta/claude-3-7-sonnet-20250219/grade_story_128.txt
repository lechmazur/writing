<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Khepri's fretful nature and hesitantly bold attribute are evident in his internal conflict, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped due to limited exploration of personal stakes beyond his grandmother's wish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the action of storytelling and the method (TV subtitles) disrupts logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Egyptian palace setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like desert heat and limestone floors, enhancing the atmosphere, though the anachronistic subtitles clash tonally with the timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about storytelling's power and uses strong imagery (e.g., stories as arrows), but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict lacks deeper resolution or tension buildup.</comment>
