<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bartholomew's ghostly nature and motivation to communicate with animals are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "solemnly silly" attribute, which feels superficially applied rather than intrinsic to his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the plastic straw and the action of perforating the veil feels contrived, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen orchard with geothermal streams is vividly described and enhances the eerie atmosphere, complementing the ghostly tone, though the setting's connection to the plastic straw feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Bartholomew's longing, with some effective imagery, but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of connection feels underdeveloped; dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the ghostly caretaker and orchard setting offer some originality, the use of a plastic straw as a mystical tool feels forced and clich√©-adjacent; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the geothermal orchard, but the plastic straw's integration feels awkward; it leaves a lingering thought, though style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing.</comment>
