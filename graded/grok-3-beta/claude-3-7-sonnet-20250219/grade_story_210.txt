<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Professor Thorne's amiable nature and scholarly dedication are evident, but his motivations lack deeper personal stakes or complexity beyond the academic pursuit; his voice feels distinct yet somewhat archetypal for a "rebellious scholar."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a satisfying resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the grant approval and the lighthouse's haunting remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like creaking timbers and moving shadows, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the tone occasionally wavers between somber and overly sentimental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through Thorne's perseverance and the lighthouse's mystique, with effective symbolism in the crossword answer "PRESENT"; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme of past meeting future lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of listening to ship timbers is original, the narrative leans on familiar "haunted place" tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like "waiting room for ghosts" feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the crossword and timbers, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
