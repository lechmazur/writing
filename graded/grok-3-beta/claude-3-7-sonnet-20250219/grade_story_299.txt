<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's portrayal as an unsure champion is clear, and her motivation to preserve cultural practices aligns with her inherited role, but her internal conflict lacks depth; her transformation feels somewhat abrupt and lacks nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—key moments like her decision-making are rushed, diminishing tension and impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chalk cliff artist colony setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like church bells and looming clouds, enhancing the cheerful gloom tone, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more deeply explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eliza’s connection to her grandmother, and the amber brooch symbolism is effective, but the central conflict’s resolution feels too neat, lacking lingering tension or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique art installation concept, some descriptions (e.g., "golden evening light") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a truly lingering thought or depth beyond the surface resolution.</comment>
