<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as a social media exorcist shapes her actions, but her motivation feels surface-level, lacking deeper emotional stakes or internal conflict. Her curiosity is clear but not nuanced, and her voice, while distinct, doesn't fully resonate with complexity or individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but the pacing feels slightly rushed toward the climax. The connection between infiltrating clubs and the final gathering is logical, though cause-and-effect links are somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting enhances the eerie tone and complements the concept of digital hauntings. Sensory details are present but sparse, missing opportunities for deeper immersion. The atmosphere supports Mira's curiosity, though it could be more vividly tied to her emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts mild curiosity about digital hauntings, with some subtext around human connection, but lacks a strong emotional punch. Imagery and symbolism (e.g., the altar of obsolete tech) are effective yet not fully layered. The ending feels purposeful but not wholly satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, and the twist on digital hauntings offers freshness, but the execution leans on familiar cyber-mystery tropes without fully subverting them. Emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and some descriptors feel generic rather than vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or profound question. Creative thinking is evident in combining elements, though the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-elaborate phrasing.</comment>
