<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elias's loyalty as a scout is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, and his motivation feels somewhat surface-level despite the emotional tie to Marissa.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between meditation and the conspiracy revelation is not fully logical or seamless within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid, moody atmosphere that enhances the tone of dread and mystery, though sensory details are sparse and could be more evocative to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elias's loss and realization, with effective symbolism in the moths, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the theme of inner storms lacks deeper subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the conspiracy angle offers some originality, the emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and certain metaphors (e.g., inner storms) feel somewhat generic and predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like moths and the journal, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
