<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hector's portrayal as a docile bruiser is intriguing, with his gentle handling of the baton and tender motivation shining through, but his inner voice and emotional depth lack nuance beyond the surface contrast of strength and softness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the treasure map and baton driving the action, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a deeper causal link to earlier tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory details like metallic blood scent and hissing vines, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the drum solos feel somewhat disconnected from the setting's core mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Hector's reunion with his brother and offers subtext about loss, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the writing occasionally tells rather than shows emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "heart of cotton candy") feel generic, and emotional handling lacks the raw specificity needed for true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the baton and lotus, leaving a lingering sense of bittersweet closure, but stylistic choices sometimes hinder clarity, and depth feels constrained by the brevity.</comment>
