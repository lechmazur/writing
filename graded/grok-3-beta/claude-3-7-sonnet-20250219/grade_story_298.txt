<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Lin's drive to weave emotional honesty into illusions, but depth is limited by the short format; his "rationally impulsive" attribute feels underexplored in action and lacks nuanced impact on decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between solving cold cases and the performance's impact on descendants is logical but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the reimagined Forbidden City is vivid and enhances the story's tone of anxious serenity; sunlight through debris is a striking atmospheric detail, though sensory immersion could be deeper with more varied details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through Lin's transformation and the theme of uncovering truth, but subtext is shallow; imagery like sunlight and dust is effective, though the ending lacks a stronger lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining historical performance with futuristic cold-case solving, but some descriptions (e.g., "anxious serenity") feel slightly formulaic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply shown through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the reimagined palace and cold-case solving, but brevity limits depth; it leaves a mild lingering thought about truth in performance, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
