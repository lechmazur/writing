<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's role as an exorcist with stage fright is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the transition from fear to acceptance lacks depth and emotional nuance, making his arc less compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the inheritance of lies and the garden reveal is logical yet lacks sufficient buildup for impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The space station amid orbital debris creates a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like tapping debris; however, the integration of toy assembly feels somewhat disconnected from the ethereal garden reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its legacy theme and has some effective imagery (glowing wildflowers), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of creators masquerading as exorcists offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "audience of stars") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like wildflowers and orbital debris, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profound one.</comment>
