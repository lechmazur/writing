<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlowe's impassive nature is well-established, and his motivation to seek grace is clear, but his inner transformation lacks depth; the contrast between his external demeanor and internal quest feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels uneven; the buildup to the bee encounter overshadows a rushed resolution, leaving the story's coherence slightly strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lush cathedral orchard is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the mystical atmosphere and complementing Marlowe’s motivation, though the timeframe of oil changes feels somewhat disconnected from the setting's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet wonder and employs effective symbolism with the bees and apple, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext; the theme of harmony is present but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original premise with the bees’ language, avoiding overt clichés, but some descriptions (e.g., “secret ember”) feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but not consistently shown over told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of mystery, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
