<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal tragedy is clear, but Elias's personality feels underdeveloped beyond vigilance and grief; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at times; the conspiracy unraveling drives the story logically, though some connections feel forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting of a paper airplane facility is intriguing but underutilized for atmosphere; sensory details are sparse, and the tone of sardonic glee clashes occasionally with the tragic undertone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through grief and justice, with some effective symbolism (paper impressions), but dialogue is minimal and subtext feels heavy-handed; conflict resolution is satisfying yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like peacock patterns and conspiracies, but reliance on familiar revenge tropes and generic descriptors (e.g., "sardonic glee") detracts; lacks fresh emotional nuance or stylistic flair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice; leaves a lingering sense of justice, though depth beyond the explicit narrative is minimal.</comment>
