<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliza's "aggressively kind" attribute is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivations feel surface-level and lack depth in reaction to the whistle and supernatural elements. The unseen observer's voice is distinct but lacks emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the whistle and whale call driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution leans on exposition over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting and midnight timeframe are evocatively paired, with strong sensory details like the whale's call vibrating through stone; however, the atmosphere occasionally overpowers character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has symbolic depth with the whistle as a gateway, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of transcendence offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "delicate balance") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies on stated insights rather than nuanced subtext; the style is distinct but not wholly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about balance, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
