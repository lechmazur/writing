<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's portrayal as a sincere rebel is clear and drives her actions, but her motivation lacks deeper nuance or backstory to fully flesh out her character within the word limit; her voice feels distinct but not uniquely compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between theorizing and the ghostly interaction is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage setting is vividly described with sensory details like damp stone and flickering lanterns, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery, though the timeframe "between storms" feels underutilized in building tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional tension through Eliza's fear and determination, but literary devices like symbolism are surface-level; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying, lacking a stronger thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on predictable gothic tropes without significant subversion; sensory details are present but not strikingly original, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length works, yet the narrative lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative spark to elevate it beyond competent execution.</comment>
