<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Percival's submissive nature is well-portrayed and shapes his initial acceptance of humiliation, but his sudden shift to confidence feels slightly unearned and lacks deeper internal conflict or gradual growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with eavesdropping driving the narrative forward, but the resolution feels rushed, and the connection between the sparrow and the agentsâ€™ plans could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting of a secret agent workshop in an estate is intriguing and complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to immerse the reader in the garden or basement atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild empathy for the sparrow and Percival, and the ending is purposeful, but it lacks deeper subtext or literary devices; dialogue is functional but not particularly distinctive or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of hidden secrets and last-minute heroism without fresh subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the sparrow, but it lacks a lingering depth or question; the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, missing a stronger stylistic punch.</comment>
