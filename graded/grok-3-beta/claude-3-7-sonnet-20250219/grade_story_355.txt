<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's aloofness is well-integrated as a shield for her inner conflict, and her motivation to free unspoken truths is clear, but her personality lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice beyond the surface-level detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, with a clear shift from burden to clarity, but pacing is uneven, and the connection between dancing and resolution feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The psychedelic art installation enhances the mood of introspection and forgotten revelry effectively, with evocative visual details, though other sensory elements like sound or touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eliza's journey to honesty, with decent use of symbolism (compass, dance), but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the theme of truth feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some individual style in imagery, the emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly surprising or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative combination of ideas to stand out at the highest level.</comment>
