<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kale's hesitance and awkwardness are portrayed consistently, shaping his internal conflict, but his transformation to determination feels abrupt and lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of emerging tied to the resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and enhances the surreal atmosphere, complementing the concept of merging worlds, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting depth.</comment>
