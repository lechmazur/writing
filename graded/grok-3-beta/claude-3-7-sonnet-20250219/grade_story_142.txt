<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Percival's motivation to restore his family legacy is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the trope of a fallen aristocrat; his actions align with desperation, yet his voice and reactions feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the concept of a pocket dimension feels forced and disrupts logical coherence; pacing is uneven, with the climax rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative, with strong sensory details like creaking wood and moonlight, enhancing the eerie tone; however, the connection between setting and object feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Percival's quest, and the theme of legacy as harmony is present, but literary devices like the shifting illustration feel gimmicky; the ending is purposeful yet lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of hidden family secrets and supernatural portals without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often overextended, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the illustration, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about legacy, though not powerfully so.</comment>
