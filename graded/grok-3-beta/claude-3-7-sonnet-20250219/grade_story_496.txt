<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a repressed poet is clear and drives the narrative, but Eleanor's internal conflict lacks deeper nuance or unique voice beyond the expected fear of exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the spontaneous decision to explore feels under-explored as a pivotal action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the overgrown city street is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation and introspection, though the timeframe's impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through Eleanor's transformation and uses effective imagery (ink as galaxies), but the central conflict feels somewhat predictable, lacking a truly surprising or layered resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of writing on skin is creative, some metaphors (walls crumbling, words as armor) feel overused, and emotional depth relies more on explicit description than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with a lingering sense of personal triumph, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
