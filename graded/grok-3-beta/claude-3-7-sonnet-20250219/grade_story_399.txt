<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mortimer's grumpiness and role as a crypt caretaker are well-defined, shaping his reluctance and isolation, but his motivation for healing feels slightly underdeveloped and his voice, while distinct, lacks deeper nuance in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between jiggling crystals and trauma revelation is logical yet somewhat forced, lacking seamless integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details, enhancing the mystical tone, though the setting's connection to Mortimer's personal trauma feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mortimer's confrontation with trauma and uses effective imagery (crystals as frozen tears), but the ending feels only moderately satisfying, and the theme of healing, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique setting, some metaphors (e.g., crypts of the heart) feel overused, and emotional handling, though shown, occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and depth of lingering impact.</comment>
