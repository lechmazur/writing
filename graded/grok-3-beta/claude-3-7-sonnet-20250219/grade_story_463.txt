<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Elias's dry wit and sentinel duty shaping his resigned yet dutiful personality, but his motivations lack deeper emotional nuance beyond duty and ritual; his voice is distinct but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the eroding promises and the final ritual could be more explicitly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting and stormy atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like creaking floorboards and crashing waves, strongly supporting the mood and character motivation, though some sensory elements feel slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response through the final dance and parting, with decent use of symbolism (frayed rope as eroding promises), but the emotional depth remains surface-level, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the ghostly waltz and sentinel duty, but the haunted lighthouse trope feels familiar without significant subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and some metaphors (sea claiming the lighthouse) are generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the waltz and rope, leaving a lingering sadness, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication due to predictable elements and limited emotional resonance.</comment>
