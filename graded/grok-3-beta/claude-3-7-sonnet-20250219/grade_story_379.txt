<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maxwell's transition from a cunning lawyer to a linguistic preservationist is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth and emotional grounding; the "impatiently patient" trait feels underexplored in action and dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the diversion action driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between past and present lacks seamless integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like artificial sunlight and hydroponic hums, enhancing the futuristic atmosphere, though the tone of ghostly resolve feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on redemption and purpose, with decent use of symbolism (gift tag as talisman), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced "showing" over "telling" in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique premise with the lawyer-linguist angle, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "ghostly resolve") feel generic, and emotional resonance lacks subtlety or depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
