<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore living obituaries aligns with his rebellious nature, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single trait, and his voice feels somewhat generic despite the unique profession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the revolution rumors and Elias's personal quest remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is vividly described and enhances the labyrinthine theme, with strong sensory details like dust motes and organ resonance, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about mortality and choice through symbolism like the mask and organ, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition rather than nuanced showing of Elias's inner conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of living obituaries is original, some metaphors (e.g., "seeds of possibility") feel overused, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable fantasy tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the mask and bookshelf, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
