<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kenzo's detachment is well-portrayed through his actions and internal conflict, but his motivation to break his vow feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in emotional nuance within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from detachment to connection is clear, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the transition to action, and the cause-effect of his decision to meddle lacks sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center enhances the theme of renewal, and sensory details like neon arteries are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel secondary to the plot rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism of the sea pottery and mural is strong, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; the theme of connection over detachment is clear but not deeply resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the collage, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
