<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Elias’s insomnia and poetic nature shaping his actions, but his motivation lacks deeper nuance; reactions to whispers feel somewhat predictable, missing a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the resolution of whispers as wisdom is rushed, lacking deeper cause-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting and timeframe between subway stops are evocatively paired, enhancing atmosphere with sensory details like train vibrations; however, the tone’s connection to non-violence feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through themes of transcendence, with effective imagery like botanical talismans; yet, the ending feels too neat, and dialogue lacks natural depth, diminishing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the interpretation of whispers as transcendence, but some metaphors (e.g., “curling like smoke”) are overused; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, risking formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like whispers and botanicals, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
