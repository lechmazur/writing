<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vex's shaky hands and mercenary background are well-integrated into his motivation for absolution, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuance in his voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and the connection between rumor chains and the final act is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artist haven is evocative and ties well to the theme of creation from destruction; sensory details like fading light are effective, though some atmospheric elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Vex's transformation and uses symbolism (amber, spider) effectively, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central theme, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements, but the emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative spark that would elevate it to the highest tier of literary impact.</comment>
