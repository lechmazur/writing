<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Morgana's glamorous undertaker persona is distinct and shapes her actions, but her deeper motivations lack nuance beyond preserving family tradition; her voice feels somewhat surface-level despite the unique profession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the ritual driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between digital and physical realms could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Social Network Archive setting is evocative and ties well to the concept of digital afterlife, with sensory details like the paint mixer's whir enhancing atmosphere; however, some sensory elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its existential sadness, and the brass measuring tape as a spiritual tether is symbolically intriguing, but the ending lacks a deeper punch, and subtext feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of digital afterlife is original and avoids overt clich√©s, with fresh imagery like the tape as a serpent; however, some descriptors (e.g., "perfectly postured shoulders") feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the brass tape and digital archive, but it lacks a lingering depth or question; the style is clear but not striking enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
