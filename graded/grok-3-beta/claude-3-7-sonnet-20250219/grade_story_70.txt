<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bartholomew's uptight nature as a scribe is well-defined through his obsession with precision, but his emotional shift feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual buildup to fully justify the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the bulb's flare and the emotional revelation is not entirely logical or earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch's greenhouse and cemetery hill setting effectively enhances the eerie, isolated atmosphere, with strong sensory details like "tombstones tilting like crooked teeth," though the timeframe's integration feels less impactful on the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Bartholomew's isolation and reconciliation, with effective symbolism in the bulb as a catalyst, but the dialogue feels forced, and the theme of transformation, while present, lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique premise, some metaphors like "arms of steel" feel slightly overused, and the emotional resolution leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the bulb and greenhouse, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
