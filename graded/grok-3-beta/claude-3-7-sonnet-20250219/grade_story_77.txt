<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's introverted empath nature is present but underdeveloped; her emotional isolation is stated rather than shown through nuanced interactions or internal conflict, limiting depth in motivation and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the marionette reassembly driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional thread within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout setting is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elara's motivation or the story's deeper themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and some subtext about outcasts, but it lacks emotional resonance and memorable craft; the ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying, with limited showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a marionette map is intriguing, the story leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion, and emotional handling feels surface-level, lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression or depth beyond the narrative; the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
