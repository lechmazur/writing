<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elias's practicality and peculiar memory are intriguing, but his motivations feel surface-level and his voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the street fair and the main action is underdeveloped.</comment>
