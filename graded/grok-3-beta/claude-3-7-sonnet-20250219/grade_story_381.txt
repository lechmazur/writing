<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the necromancer's quest to map the cave for a lost partner, but the personality lacks depth beyond grief; the "hushed" trait feels underexplored in action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by mapping the cave, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between past and present configurations lacks deeper integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with bioluminescent details, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone, though sensory immersion could be broader beyond visual elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through loss and memory, with decent use of symbolism (baseball cap), but the conflict feels understated, and the ending lacks a stronger punch or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the blend of necromancy and technology is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable grief tropes without subversion, and emotional expression often feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate descriptions, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; lacks lingering depth.</comment>
