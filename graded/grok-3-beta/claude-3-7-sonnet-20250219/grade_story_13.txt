<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of localizing the mutation driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The toppled clock tower and desert setting are vividly described and enhance the atmosphere of decay and resilience, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sand and wind to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through the swordsman’s realization, with some effective symbolism in the garden, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful yet not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of evolutionary tracking is unique, the narrative leans on familiar quest tropes without subversion, and emotional portrayal occasionally feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the trail of poems, but the style lacks distinct flair, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength, leaving lingering impact muted.</comment>
