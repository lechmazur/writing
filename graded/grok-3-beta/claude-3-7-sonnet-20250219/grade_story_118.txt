<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Swarm's hive-mind nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation feels abstract and lacks personal stakes. Mercer's attachment to the charger plug reveals trauma, but his voice and reactions remain somewhat generic, missing deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit. The connection between hindsight and the mission is logical, though the wax-dripping method as a plot driver feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret agent facility setting is evocative and fits the tone, but sensory details are sparse beyond the candle wax. The night air and anticipation create atmosphere, yet the setting's potential to enhance character motivation remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Mercer's breakthrough, but the symbolism of wax feels heavy-handed. Dialogue is purposeful but not entirely natural. Subtext exists, yet the central conflict lacks sharpness within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the hive-mind therapist is a unique concept, the story leans on predictable trauma tropes without subversion. Sensory details are specific but limited, and emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic. Creative thinking is evident in the wax-coding idea, yet the style lacks polish, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
