<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor’s portrayal as a gracious widow is consistent, and her motivation to nurture the orchard out of love and defiance is clear, but her inner world lacks deeper complexity or distinct voice beyond the surface sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of nurturing driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the mysterious postcards as a method introduce an intriguing yet underexplored causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district and perpetual fog create a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone and supports Eleanor’s motivation; sensory details like swirling fog are evocative, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eleanor’s quiet defiance and love, with some effective symbolism (forge as sanctuary), but the ending feels predictable, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements like postcards and fog, metaphors like “skeletal sentinels” feel overused, and emotional depth relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a truly lingering impact or depth beyond the explicit narrative; creative thinking is present but not groundbreaking.</comment>
