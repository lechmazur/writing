<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters like Dr. Mei and the traveler are intriguing but underdeveloped; their motivations (especially the travelerâ€™s) remain vague, lacking depth in reactions and personal stakes despite the unique "hatefully adored" dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the hidden instructions driving a satisfying resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The submarine research facility is vividly rendered with sensory details like groaning metal and dim blue lights, enhancing the mood of mystery, though the connection between setting and chopsticks feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its theme of seeing hidden patterns, with strong symbolism in the broken chopstick, but dialogue feels occasionally stilted, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the cookbook, leaving a lingering idea about perception, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
