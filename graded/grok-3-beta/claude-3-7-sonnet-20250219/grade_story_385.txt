<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Eleanor Finch's portrayal as a "pleasant meddler" feels underdeveloped; her manipulative nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or interactions, missing a distinct voice or nuanced motivation beyond the symbols.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed toward the resolution, and the cosmic event concept lacks deeper integration into the narrative's cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and hospital ward setting before sunrise create a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and character motivation feels superficial rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with the symbols as invitations, but emotional impact is limited by a lack of "showing" over "telling," and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a strong lingering resonance or tension resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of transcending worlds offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar mystery tropes without subversion, and emotional nuance is stated rather than felt, with generic descriptors weakening authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style lacks clarity in places, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, missing a truly lingering thought or depth.</comment>
