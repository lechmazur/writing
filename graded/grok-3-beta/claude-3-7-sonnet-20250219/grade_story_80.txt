<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias Thorne's daring nature and cluelessness are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to solve the riddle feels surface-level and lacks emotional depth or personal stakes beyond obsession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the roller coaster transformation providing a satisfying climax, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and some logical connections between clues and outcome are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone, with strong sensory details like rusted steps and coastal winds, though the connection between setting and doorknob feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and awe through the celestial calculator reveal, with some effective symbolism, but lacks deeper emotional resonance or subtext; the ending is intriguing but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a transforming roller coaster is original, the narrative leans on familiar "ancient mystery" tropes without subversion; sensory details are specific but not always nuanced, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the doorknob and roller coaster, leaving a lingering sense of wonder, but uneven depth and reliance on familiar themes prevent it from reaching true excellence.</comment>
