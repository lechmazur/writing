<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's aloofness as an orphan shapes his personality and actions well, particularly in his preference for stones over human connection, but his motivation lacks depth beyond surface-level isolation. His transformation at the end feels slightly abrupt, missing nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the gravitational anomaly driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels uneven—initial setup drags while the resolution rushes. Cause and effect are logical, though some oddities (e.g., calendar flipping) feel disconnected from the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The garage setting and gravitational anomaly create a surreal atmosphere that supports the story's tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to immerse the reader. The setting enhances the action, yet its connection to Elias's emotional journey feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias's release of the stones, with decent symbolism, but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing. The ending is satisfying, though dialogue is minimal and lacks distinctiveness. Subtext exists but lacks depth for profound reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story offers some originality in combining personal loss with a gravitational anomaly, but metaphors (e.g., stones as memories) are somewhat predictable. Emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, and the tone shifts slightly unnaturally at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and while there’s creative thinking in the anomaly, the overall impact lacks the depth for a lingering impression.</comment>
