<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's ability to see ghosts and his role as an elevator repair technician are intriguing, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the drive to help spirits is stated but lacks deeper emotional grounding or conflict within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax of the ghost's release; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between staking out ghost tours and the lab feels somewhat convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a unique and evocative setting that enhances the theme of preservation and impermanence; sensory details like the "dissonance of silence" are effective, though more varied sensory immersion could deepen the atmosphere further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through Marcus's unusual calling, and the ending is satisfying; however, literary devices like symbolism are present but not fully layered, and the central conflict of helping the ghost feels resolved too neatly without lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost-seeing repairman in a sand castle lab is original, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes of ghostly release without significant subversion; metaphors are fresh in places but not consistently striking, and emotional nuance is present yet somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the lab and the flower crown, but the brief length occasionally limits depth; it leaves a lingering feeling of bittersweet resolution, though the style could be more distinctive to elevate clarity and impact.</comment>
