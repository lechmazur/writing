<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is evocative and enhances the mood of decay and mystery, with sensory details like waterlogged surroundings, but the atmosphere's connection to shared dreams feels slightly tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of shared dreams offers originality, but the execution relies on somewhat predictable tropes of hidden knowledge and sacrifice; emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the costume and zeppelin, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
