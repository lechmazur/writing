<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation for revenge is clear and tied to his creative precision as a candy sculptor, but his personality lacks depth beyond the vendetta; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and implied resolution, driven by the counterattack, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and some cause-effect links are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the clandestine tone and supports Marcus's motivation, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere and immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of revenge via kindness, with some effective symbolism (sugar as weapon), but the ending lacks punch, and subtext feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of revenge through candy sculptures is original, and metaphors like sweetness-as-weapon are fresh, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative leans on predictable revenge tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like candy sculptures, but it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the explicit narrative; style is clear but not particularly striking.</comment>
