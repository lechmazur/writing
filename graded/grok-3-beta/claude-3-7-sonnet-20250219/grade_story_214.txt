<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Harlan's motivation to find meaning in loss is clear and ties to his solitude as a lone trapper, but his personality lacks depth beyond grief; his voice, though distinct in dialogue, feels repetitive and overly melancholic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between decoding microfilm and the black hole signals is logical but underdeveloped, leaving the resolution slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting is vividly rendered and enhances the isolation and tone of gritty whimsy; sensory details like the hum and starlight are effective, though smell and taste are absent, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Harlan's grief and hope, with strong symbolism in the sea glass, but the ending feels slightly forced; subtext is present but not fully layered, and dialogue is minimal yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of loss and cosmic connection is original, some metaphors (e.g., "black hole of doubt") feel overused; emotional resonance is shown but occasionally stated, and the tone wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like sea glass and the observatory, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering feeling of hope, though not profoundly so.</comment>
