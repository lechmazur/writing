<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's claustrophobia shapes her internal conflict effectively, and her motivation to study human behavior under trauma is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond this struggle; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (memory of trauma), middle (healing moment), and end (resolve to return), but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between tasting jam and healing is not fully developed logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly described and enhances the surreal, healing atmosphere, with sensory details like taste and warmth standing out; however, the setting's connection to Eliza's underwater trauma feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eliza's journey, with some effective imagery (steam forming sea creatures), but the dialogue feels slightly forced, and the central conflict of claustrophobia lacks a sharper resolution or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the floating tea house and jam-tasting method offer originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of trauma and healing without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and some descriptors feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the tea house and jam, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
