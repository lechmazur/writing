<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's ruthlessness as a flower arranger is intriguingly tied to her precision in decoding rock art, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the transition from floristry to ancient watcher lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of distinguishing markings driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the road trip conversations as a method seem underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stone circle setting and solstice timeframe are vividly rendered with sensory details like the singer’s pause, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between the comb and setting feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of connection across time, with effective imagery and a satisfying ending, but the central conflict is understated, and the theme of legacy, while present, lacks deeper subtext or emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in linking flower arranging to ancient observation, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptions (e.g., “burden transforming into privilege”) verge on cliché, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the comb and stone circle, leaving a lingering thought about legacy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
