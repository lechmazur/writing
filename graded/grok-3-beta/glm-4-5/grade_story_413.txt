<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's listless nature and naive sophistication are present but lack depth; his transformation feels abrupt and unearned, with motivation clear but not richly explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the invitation and resolution lacks nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brevity limits depth, leaving the impact more surface-level than profound.</comment>
