<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's phobia and motivation are clear, but the portrayal lacks depth; reactions feel surface-level, and the voice is indistinct, missing nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; pacing is uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolution and tenuous cause-effect links between garage sales and pyramid discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d metaphors (dancing on the edge) without subversion; emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, lacking originality or nuanced style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion, but style lacks clarity and depth; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with minimal lingering impact.</comment>
