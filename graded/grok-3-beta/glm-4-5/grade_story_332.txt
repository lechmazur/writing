<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "fiercely gentle" attribute is reflected in their reverent actions, but motivation feels slightly abstract; the leap of faith lacks deeper grounding in personal history or specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed at the end; the connection between confessions and personal transformation isn’t fully fleshed out within the word limit, leaving coherence slightly strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric garden is vividly realized with imaginative sensory details, enhancing the tone of isolation; atmosphere strongly supports the theme of intimate separation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes loneliness effectively through imagery and subtext, but the ending feels more symbolic than emotionally satisfying; central theme is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others (e.g., garden holding its breath) feel slightly clichéd; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth in character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound impact.</comment>
