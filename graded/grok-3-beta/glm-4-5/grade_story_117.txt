<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at key moments, and the connection between actions and outcomes is occasionally vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mosaic realities offers originality, metaphors like "shattered glass" feel generic, and emotional depth is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but style occasionally obscures clarity, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
