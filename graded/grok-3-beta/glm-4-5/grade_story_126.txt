<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to shatter the illusion is clear but lacks depth; the aloof passion feels surface-level and underdeveloped, failing to create a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the butter churn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between ascending via a poster and shattering the illusion feels forced and lacks logical coherence; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting and timeframe mesh well with the concept of a dead Earth, and the atmosphere supports the tone of desolation, but sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse the reader in the space station's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with the illusion theme, but emotional impact is weak due to telling over showing; symbolism of the butter churn and sparks is intriguing but not fully developed; ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, the execution relies on predictable tropes of dystopian rebellion without fresh subversion; metaphors like the poster are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
