<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the obsession to map railways tied to grief, but the woodsman’s personality feels underdeveloped; his "artfully messy" trait is superficial and lacks depth in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of short-circuiting mirroring emotional collapse, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the railway mapping’s impact on the resolution is slightly vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is a striking, evocative setting that enhances the surreal atmosphere and ties to the concept of signals and loss, though sensory details are unevenly distributed and some elements feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the woodsman’s confession and loss, with some effective symbolism in the hairbrush and echoes, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the radio wave garden and grief mapping, but emotional expression occasionally feels stated rather than shown, and some metaphors (e.g., signals forming a path) border on clichéd without fresh subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and there’s creative interplay between grief and mapping, but the style lacks consistent polish, and the brevity sometimes undercuts emotional depth.</comment>
