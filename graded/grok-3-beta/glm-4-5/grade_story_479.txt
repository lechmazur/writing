<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glamorous undertaker's persona is intriguing, and her motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the surface glamour and dedication. Her reactions to the brass measuring tape and social media archives reveal some connection to her craft, yet her voice remains indistinct, missing nuanced emotional layers or personal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action of elongating the coffin measurements drives a symbolic plot, but the story feels more conceptual than narrative-driven, lacking a strong arc within the word limit. Pacing is uneven, with repetitive reflections slowing momentum. Cause and effect are logical, but the overall coherence suffers from a lack of resolution or tangible conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting of the social network archive is novel and ties to the concept of ordinariness, enhancing the undertaker’s search for truth. However, sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of jubilant remorse feels forced rather than organically woven into the setting. The tone supports the theme but lacks immersive grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild reflection on life and death through symbolism (crimson paint, brass tape), but emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing. Subtext about digital personas and mortality is present but underdeveloped. The ending feels purposeful yet predictable, lacking a striking punch. Writing style is competent but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story offers a unique angle with the glamorous undertaker and ancient rituals, avoiding overt clichés, but metaphors like “digital footprints” and “blood coursing through veins” are generic. Emotional handling leans on stated feelings (“jubilant remorse”) rather than nuanced depiction. Tone is consistent but lacks a truly individual style, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its thematic focus on life, death, and legacy, integrating most assigned elements meaningfully. However, the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, and the style, while clear, lacks flair. It leaves a lingering thought about mortality but lacks the depth for profound impact.</comment>
