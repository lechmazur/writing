<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The exiled princeâ€™s motivation to cure loneliness is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; reactions to the mortar and pestle feel symbolic but not personal enough to reveal nuanced character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the snowstorm-driven encounter propelling the story forward logically, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a chilling, isolated atmosphere that supports the theme of loneliness; sensory details like frigid air and howling winds are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective response with its theme of self-discovery, and the mirror as a symbol of inner truth is effective; however, dialogue feels cryptic rather than natural, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of unseen forces and self-discovery offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of exile and magical resolution without fully subverting them; metaphors are adequate but not strikingly fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate short length, and the elements are mostly in service of the narrative; it leaves a lingering thought about self-acceptance, though the style lacks the polish needed for top-tier impact.</comment>
