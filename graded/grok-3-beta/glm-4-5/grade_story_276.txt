<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal loss is clear, but Elara's personality lacks depth beyond eccentricity; the "uneasy emissary" trait feels underexplored in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced by the word limit; connections between actions and resolution are tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the orbital station is evocative and ties to the concept, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere sometimes feels detached from character emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some symbolism (coathanger, branches) adds depth, but emotional impact is inconsistent; the ending is purposeful but not fully earned due to shallow conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality in combining elements is notable, but metaphors like "branches of redemption" feel overused and vague; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element use, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; depth is hinted at but not fully realized within the constraints.</comment>
