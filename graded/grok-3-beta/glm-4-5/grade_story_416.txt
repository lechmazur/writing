<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to collect urban legends is clear, but Aldric's straight-laced nature feels underexplored and occasionally at odds with his rebellious streak; lacks depth in personality and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; connection between championship reset and swamp quest is weak, disrupting coherence.</comment>
