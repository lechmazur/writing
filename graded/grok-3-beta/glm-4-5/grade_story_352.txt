<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve musical traditions is clear, but the feral sky nomad lacks depth or distinct voice; her actions feel driven by concept rather than personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven, and cause-effect relationships are vague, lacking concrete progression or stakes.</comment>
