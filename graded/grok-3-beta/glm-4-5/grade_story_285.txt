<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hesitant swordsman’s awkwardness is evident, and his motivation to restore traditional systems is clear, but his personality lacks depth or distinct voice; his internal conflict feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the swordsman’s emergence from exile, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and cause-effect relationships are implied rather than concretely developed, leading to a somewhat vague progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and supports the theme of coexistence, but sensory details are limited beyond visual imagery, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through its theme of bridging worlds, and symbolism like the blank postcard is effective, but the writing often tells rather than shows emotions, and the ending feels more predictable than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of bridging tradition and progress is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat generic metaphors (hermit crabs, steam vents) and lacks a truly fresh perspective; emotional handling feels surface-level rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated; it leaves a mild lingering thought about balance, but lacks the depth for a prestigious publication.</comment>
