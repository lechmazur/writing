<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for escape is clear, but the brooding sculptor’s personality lacks depth beyond surface melancholy; actions align with longing for freedom, yet the voice feels indistinct and generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete despite the word limit; disappearance drives the story, but pacing is uneven with a rushed ending, and cause-effect links are vague around the method of escape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the impact crater research base is evocative and ties to the dusty atmosphere, but sensory details are limited, and the car washing timeframe feels underutilized in enhancing mood or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery (dust in a sunbeam) is striking, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is shallow, relying on stated longing rather than shown nuance; lacks deeper subtext or compelling conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in the escape method, but metaphors like “rivulets that resembled tears” feel clichéd; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but unremarkable, and depth beyond the narrative is minimal.</comment>
