<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brother Elias's spinelessness is portrayed inconsistently; it shapes his humility with plants but lacks depth in past leadership failures. Motivation to understand flowers is clear but not deeply explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with Elias's transformation, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution. The connection between tears and floral response drives the story, though it lacks deeper cause-and-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is evocative and enhances the melancholic tone. Sensory details of rain and glass are effective, though other senses are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Elias's loneliness and discovery. Imagery and symbolism (tears, flowers) are present but not strikingly original. The ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of blurring boundaries offers some originality, the execution relies on predictable emotional descriptors and lacks fresh metaphors. Emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative. However, the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting depth. It leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound impact.</comment>
