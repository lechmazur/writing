<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the carefree gambler’s trustworthiness is mentioned but not convincingly shown through actions or dialogue, and motivation feels surface-level despite the island memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between blueprint and resolution lacks clarity within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reverse engineering workshop setting is evocative and mirrors the character’s mind, but sensory details are sparse, and the island memories’ atmosphere feels disconnected from the workshop’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with imagery like “hammered repose,” but emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch despite thematic potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by predictable tropes of a haunted past and secret technology; while some imagery is fresh, emotional handling feels generic, lacking nuanced subtext or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated but feel forced at times, and the style lacks the polish or depth for a truly lingering impact.</comment>
