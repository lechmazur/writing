<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathic nature and tragic joy are intriguing, shaping a unique personality, but its motivation to seek truth feels somewhat abstract and lacks deeper personal stakes or evolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the statue's vigil and the artist's recognition, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger causal link to feel fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like hissing pipes and flickering lamps, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness, though the setting's connection to the hair tie feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of isolation and connection, with strong imagery and symbolism in the hair tie, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of truth-seeking lacks deeper subtext or layers beyond the surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is original, some metaphors (e.g., "city of lies") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like telepathy and calligraphy, leaving a lingering sense of longing, but the style occasionally leans ornate, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
