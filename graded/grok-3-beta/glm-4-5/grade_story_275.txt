<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear, but his "theoretically rebellious" attribute feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping his actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the action of translating drives the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a vivid, evocative atmosphere that enhances the tone of deliberate wilderness and supports the hermit's motivation, with strong sensory details of light and desolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of renewal, and the ending is satisfying, but the writing leans on explicit statements over showing, and subtext is only superficially present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the hermit's quest for renewal feels somewhat predictable, and sensory details, though present, lack striking originality; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate short length, and the elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but it lacks a truly lingering impact or profound depth beyond the surface theme.</comment>
