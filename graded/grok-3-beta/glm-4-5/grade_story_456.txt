<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The morbid florist’s personality is shaped by her neutral passion and tempered beliefs, but her motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks personal depth. Her reaction to the candle reveals curiosity, yet her actions lack a distinct voice or nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically through the discovery of the candle and trunk, with a discernible arc within the word limit. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect relationships, while clear, lack deeper complexity or tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and lantern’s flicker create a striking, surreal atmosphere that enhances the cosmic theme. Sensory details are evocative but sparse, and the setting’s connection to the candle feels more symbolic than integral at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild wonder through cosmic imagery and symbolism, with a discernible theme of cycles. However, emotional impact is limited by surface-level character reactions, and the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining surreal elements like the dojo and cosmic cycles, avoiding overt clichés. However, some descriptions are generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate.
