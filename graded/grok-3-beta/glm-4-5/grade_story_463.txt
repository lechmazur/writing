<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the sentinel's dry wit is mentioned but not shown through dialogue or action, and motivations feel vague despite the emotional connection to the ghost. Lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between confiscating the journal and the dance lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively haunting with the lighthouse setting and ghostly presence, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotion through the dance motif, but relies on telling over showing; the ending feels somewhat purposeful but lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable ghostly romance tropes without subversion; metaphors like "eroding promises" are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style lacks the polish or depth needed for a lingering impact.</comment>
