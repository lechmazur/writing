<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map migration patterns is clear but lacks depth; the "selfless" trait feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect between the mark of trust and reunion is logical yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the recycled spaceship is evocative and supports the tone, with sensory details like wind chimes adding atmosphere, but connections between setting and character motivation remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story evokes a faint emotional response through themes of reunion, but literary devices like "savage grace" feel forced; dialogue is purposeful yet lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining music and cosmic longing, but reliance on tropes of isolated travelers and fated meetings without subversion; metaphors like "eyes like distant galaxies" are clich√©d.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, lacking deeper resonance.</comment>
