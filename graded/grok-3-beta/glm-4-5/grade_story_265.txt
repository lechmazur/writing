<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The deputy's impassive and personally impersonal nature is consistently portrayed, and his motivation to witness grace is clear, but his internal transformation lacks depth or nuanced progression, feeling somewhat abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of stretching toward understanding driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the oil changes, remain tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lush orchard in the cathedral rafters is vividly described and enhances the ethereal atmosphere, effectively supporting the tone of cautious bravery and the concept of uncharted echoes, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sight and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of wonder and has a satisfying ending, with decent use of symbolism (twist tie, apple), but it leans too heavily on telling over showing, especially in emotional shifts, and lacks a deeper, more provocative subtext or theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the surreal orchard and bees offer some originality, the narrative relies on familiar mystical tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions feel stated rather than nuanced, lacking a truly distinctive style or voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, shows some creative thinking in combining surreal and mundane, and leaves a lingering sense of mystery, but overly abstract language and uneven depth hinder clarity and impact.</comment>
