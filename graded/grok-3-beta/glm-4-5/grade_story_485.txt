<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the underwater setting offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of betrayal and genius under threat without subversion; metaphors are somewhat generic, lacking fresh nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
