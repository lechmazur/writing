<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The meek necromancer’s sincerity and motivation to regain family respect are clear and consistent, but the character lacks a distinct voice or deeper complexity beyond the surface trait of meekness. Reactions to the fountain pen feel symbolic but underexplored in shaping personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of decoding the riddle driving the story forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the dew drop revelation and the universal answer is logical but not fully fleshed out, diminishing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with playground sounds and bioluminescent fungi, enhancing the mystic tone and supporting the character’s quest. However, sensory details like smell or touch are underutilized, and the setting’s connection to the fountain pen feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response with its theme of interconnectedness, and the tapestry as a symbol of universal balance is effective. Yet, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict of decoding the riddle lacks intense tension, relying more on exposition than showing through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on necromancy through meekness and sincerity, avoiding some genre clichés. However, the emotional resonance is stated rather than deeply shown, and certain descriptors (e.g., “peculiarly sincere”) feel slightly generic. Metaphors like the dew drop are creative but not entirely unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with most elements integrated in service of the theme, and the brief length seems deliberate. However, the style occasionally leans on overt explanation over subtlety, and the lingering impact is thoughtful but not profound, missing a sharper emotional or intellectual hook.</comment>
