<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the underwater caste system, but metaphors like "pearls forming around grains of sand" feel generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements integrated into the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length works, though depth is sacrificed, leaving lingering thoughts underdeveloped.</comment>
