<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the hushed necromancer's motivation to map the cave is stated but lacks depth or emotional grounding. The connection to old movies feels forced and doesn't meaningfully shape personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks a compelling arc within the word limit; the action of dominating magical currents is clear, but the progression feels predictable and the pacing rushed at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with some sensory detail, but the futuristic nostalgia tone feels unevenly integrated, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; there’s little emotional resonance or subtext, and the ending feels perfunctory rather than satisfying. Imagery is present but not striking or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by clichéd elements like the "sound of resolve" and generic nostalgic references. Writing lacks a distinct style, and emotional depiction is stated rather than shown, feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than integral. The story lacks depth or a lingering impact, and the brevity feels like a limitation, not a strength.</comment>
