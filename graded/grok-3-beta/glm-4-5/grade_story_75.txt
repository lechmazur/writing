<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn extinct crafts is clear, but the guarded nature feels underdeveloped in action and voice; reactions to the bookmark lack depth in revealing personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but rushed; the action of disowning feels symbolic yet lacks concrete stakes or logical progression within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Nano-forest setting is evocative and complements the tone of angry peace, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and connection to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through theme of imperfection, but symbolism (bookmark, vows) feels heavy-handed; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining nano-forest with extinct crafts, but reliance on predictable themes of technology vs. humanity and generic descriptors dulls impact; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans overly ornate, hindering clarity; length feels like a limitation, and depth beyond narrative is surface-level.</comment>
