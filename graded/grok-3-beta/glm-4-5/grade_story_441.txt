<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to compose a lullaby of heartbreak is intriguing but underdeveloped; the philosopher's "usually unusual" trait feels stated rather than shown through distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced by the flash mob run-in; pacing is uneven, with the ending rushed, lacking deeper resolution within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in pairing science with sorrow, but metaphors like "fallen leaves" are generic; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constructed around them rather than using them naturally; lacks lingering depth or profound impact.</comment>
