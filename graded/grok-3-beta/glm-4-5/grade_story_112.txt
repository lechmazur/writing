<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear, but the "aimless traveler" trait feels underexplored; their transformation lacks depth and emotional nuance beyond stated feelings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the hopscotch board as a coded map is intriguing yet underdeveloped in logic and integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is unique but underutilized for atmosphere; sensory details like snowflake melting are evocative but sparse, limiting immersion and mood enhancement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response with "mournful elation," but lacks deeper subtext or memorable impact; writing shows competence but not distinct style or profound theme development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in connecting hopscotch to recipes, but reliance on predictable preservation narrative and explicit emotional statements ("mournful elation") feels formulaic and lacks nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, but lacks lingering depth or stylistic flair; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
