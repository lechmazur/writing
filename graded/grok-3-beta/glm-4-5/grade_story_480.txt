<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to "feed curiosity with lifeâ€™s raw edge" is intriguing but underdeveloped; the social media exorcist lacks depth and a distinct voice, with actions feeling more plot-driven than personality-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and incoherent at times; cause-effect relationships are vague, especially regarding how infiltrating secret clubs leads to the ritual's success.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting is evocative with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere's connection to the timeframe and concept feels forced and lacks consistent mood reinforcement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with digital-physical connection but fails to evoke strong emotion or thought; ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, with minimal showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Some originality in the social media exorcist concept, but reliance on generic descriptors and predictable ritual tropes undermines uniqueness; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is functional but unremarkable, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
