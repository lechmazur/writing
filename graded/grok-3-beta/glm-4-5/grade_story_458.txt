<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve bibliomancy is clear, but the spiritually secular attribute feels underexplored in shaping personality or actions; reactions to the button are symbolic but lack depth in revealing inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a choice driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between obliteration and coffee stain reading is conceptually intriguing yet logically vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the tone of fractal sorrow, though the connection between setting and object (button) feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on loss and renewal with strong imagery (coffee stains, ghostly echoes), but the ending feels slightly unresolved, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining bibliomancy with a futuristic setting, but metaphors like "ghostly tendrils" feel overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of loss, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
