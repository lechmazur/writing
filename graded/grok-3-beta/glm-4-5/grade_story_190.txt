<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of predicting a drought driving the narrative forward. However, the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between musical memories and drought prediction is tenuous, weakening coherence.</comment>

The tone of enthusiastic apathy contrasts with the concept but isn't consistently felt in the mood or setting descriptions, missing immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and some emotional resonance tied to empathy, but it often tells rather than shows feelings.
