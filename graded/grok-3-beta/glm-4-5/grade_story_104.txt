<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The stoic steward's personality is somewhat developed through his internal yearning for more, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; the connection between his stoicism and actions feels surface-level and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between venerating his grandmother and the encrypted shipping lacks strong causal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood of quiet rebellion, with effective sensory details like the creak of the building; however, the timeframe of harvest day feels underutilized and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the steward's subtle rebellion, and the symbolism of cracks in the façade is promising, but the ending feels predictable, and the conflict lacks intensity or sharp resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the narrative of quiet rebellion feels somewhat formulaic, and the sensory details, though present, are not strikingly original; the writing shows some style but lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is understated, lacking a profound question or feeling.</comment>
