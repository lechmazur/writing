<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to family legacy is clear, but the farmer’s personality lacks depth beyond the “earthy” descriptor; actions align with motivation, yet there’s no distinct voice or nuanced reaction to reveal inner complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed; cause and effect are logical, though the action of restoration lacks tension or stakes to drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Northern lights setting enhances atmosphere and complements the hushed tone, with vivid visual details; however, sensory immersion beyond sight is minimal, and the connection between setting and object feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotion through family legacy, and the ending feels purposeful; however, literary devices like symbolism are underdeveloped, conflict is minimal, and it leans on telling over showing emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining restoration with northern lights, but metaphors are generic, emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative follows a predictable sentimental template without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; yet, it lacks a lingering depth or question, and creative integration of elements remains surface-level.</comment>
