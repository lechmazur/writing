<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's fierce loyalty is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict; motivation feels surface-level and lacks nuanced development within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed; the action of radicalizing via coded jokes is intriguing but lacks depth in execution and logical grounding within the story's brief span.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the moth observation tower is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the flickering lights feel underutilized in enhancing atmosphere or character struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Some originality in combining coded humor with resistance, but execution feels formulaic; emotional descriptions are stated rather than nuanced, and metaphors like "inside storms" are overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but style lacks polish; brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, and it fails to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
