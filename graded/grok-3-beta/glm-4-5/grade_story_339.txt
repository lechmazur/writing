<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a joyless performer is clear, tied to guilt over her sister’s accident, but development feels surface-level; her inner conflict lacks depth and her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves a basic arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed toward resolution; the action of organizing memories drives the story, yet connections between past and present remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prismatic lake setting is evocative with strong sensory detail, enhancing the reflective tone, but the construction timeframe feels tacked on and underutilized in relation to the character’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through guilt and resolution, with decent imagery like the seesaw echo, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable impact; conflict resolution feels too neat for the complexity hinted at.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative leans on predictable emotional beats of guilt and redemption without fresh subversion; metaphors like the seesaw are functional but not striking, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinct flair, and while it hints at depth, the impact doesn’t linger beyond the read.</comment>
