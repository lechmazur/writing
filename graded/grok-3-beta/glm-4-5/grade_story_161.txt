<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The orchardist’s vigilance and punctuality are clear, and his motivation tied to personal tragedy is compelling, but his personality lacks depth beyond the functional role in the conspiracy; actions align with motivation but feel predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the conspiracy driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at times, and some cause-effect links (like the sudden evidence folding) are abrupt and strain coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The setting of a hidden test facility under a fruit farm is intriguing but underexplored; sensory details are minimal, and the atmosphere supports the conspiracy tone but lacks immersive depth to enhance mood or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the daughter’s tragedy, and the peacock symbolism is a highlight, but the ending feels slightly forced, and the central conflict resolution lacks nuanced emotional showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the conspiracy angle offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of hidden facilities and personal vendettas; metaphors like the peacock are fresh but sparse, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a limitation, and while there’s creative intent, the impact lacks lingering depth or profound resonance.</comment>
