<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation as a dream thief seeking wholeness is intriguing, but his personality lacks depth and distinct voice; actions align with motivation but feel predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the plunge into a dream as a clear driver, though pacing feels rushed at the end and coherence wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a treehouse is evocative and enhances the solitary tone, with strong sensory details of dust and light, though the post-human timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with overworked phrases; it leaves a lingering idea of loss, though not powerfully.</comment>
