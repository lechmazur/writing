<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the override action driving progression, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between polaroids and genetic data is logically strained within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of a synthetic biology lab is intriguing and fits the timeframe, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere only partially supports the hollow recklessness tone, missing immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story has a central conflict and some symbolic potential with the compass and horizons, but emotional impact is shallow, and the ending feels more abrupt than purposeful; lacks subtext or deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Some originality in combining mystic and sci-fi elements, but reliance on predictable "lost history" tropes and generic descriptors for emotion and setting detract from authenticity; writing lacks a distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels constrained by brevity rather than deliberate; lacks a lingering impact or creative depth beyond surface-level narrative.</comment>
