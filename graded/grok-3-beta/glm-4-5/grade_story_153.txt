<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the eternal pursuit of immortality, but depth and emotional nuance are lacking; the student feels more like a concept than a person, missing a distinct voice or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit with a logical progression from pursuit to resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the underground city is vividly realized with bioluminescent fungi and geothermal warmth, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation; however, sensory details beyond sight are underutilized, missing deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intellectual curiosity about immortality and burdens, with some symbolism around the headlamp, but emotional impact is muted due to detached narration; ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the underground setting and digitization concept, but the eternal student trope feels familiar without subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly serving the narrative, though style occasionally leans toward overwrought descriptions; it leaves a lingering thought on immortality but lacks profound depth for top-tier impact.</comment>
