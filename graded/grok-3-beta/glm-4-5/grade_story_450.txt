<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's sharp wit and dance background are present but underdeveloped; her linguistic ineptitude feels like an add-on rather than a core trait driving her actions. Motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the prophecy and family legacy, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between the bubble bath setting and action feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The thought experiment chamber is intriguing and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the bubble bath timeframe feels more quirky than integral to the mood or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Maya's acceptance of her legacy, and the symbolism of the patch is effective, but the writing often tells rather than shows, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of ancestral dance and prophecy is somewhat original, the execution relies on familiar tropes of hidden family secrets without significant subversion; metaphors like "grace of a swan" feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with forced integration of concepts like the bubble bath; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
