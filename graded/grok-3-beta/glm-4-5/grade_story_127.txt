<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between memory and resolution is logical but lacks sufficient buildup for impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative relies on predictable reconciliation tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like “notes flowing like water” are somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; lacks a lingering depth or unique style to elevate it beyond average.</comment>
