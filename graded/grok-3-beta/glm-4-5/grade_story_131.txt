<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness is present but underdeveloped; his transformation from isolation to courage feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation. The character's voice is not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the gravitational anomaly driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the resolution lacks impactful closure. Cause and effect are logical but not compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is vividly portrayed and enhances the atmosphere, with the setting complementing the concept well. Sensory details like the humming stones are effective, though other senses are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with Eli’s shift, and the cryptic message adds subtext, but the impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing. The theme of letting go is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly offers originality, and metaphors like floating stones are somewhat fresh, but the emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced. The narrative avoids major clichés but lacks a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, but the style is merely functional, not distinctive. It leaves a lingering thought, though not a profound one. Overall, it’s competent but not exceptional.</comment>
