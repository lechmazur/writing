<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's obsession to decode temple inscriptions, but his personality lacks depth beyond exhaustion and determination; reactions to the cutlass feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional texture or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the coffee ground patterns driving discovery, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end relies heavily on symbolic coincidence rather than organic cause-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The digital nomad camp at dawn is evocative with sensory details like pre-dawn darkness and horizon’s hush, enhancing the quietly dramatic tone, but the setting’s connection to the cutlass and ancient mystery feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story hints at deeper meaning with ancient medical knowledge, and the ending is somewhat satisfying, but emotional impact is limited by 'telling' over 'showing'; imagery like coffee patterns is intriguing yet underdeveloped for lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of coffee ground patterns offers a novel twist, the narrative leans on predictable obsession-driven tropes without subversion; sensory details are present but generic at times, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, and depth beyond the narrative is suggested but not fully realized.</comment>
