<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the map, dances, and orchard lacks clear causality, leaving some transitions abrupt and forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting is vividly imaginative and enhances the mystical tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere struggles to fully support Elias’s motivations beyond surface-level wonder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a floating orchard and metaphysical dances is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic imagery and predictable mystical tropes without enough subversion or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often feels overwrought, and the brief length exposes gaps in emotional depth, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
