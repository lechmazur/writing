<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's drive to preserve folk medicines, but the "angrily peaceful" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistent in shaping his actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with hacking music playlists driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the mood and complements Elias's forgotten status, with strong sensory details like flickering lights, though some connections to folk medicine feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through Elias's mission, with decent use of symbolism in the cracked teapot, but lacks deeper subtext and relies too much on telling over showing emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a forgotten prodigy is unique, the narrative leans on predictable redemption tropes, and some metaphors (e.g., fractured career) are generic rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks distinct flair, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, missing a truly lingering impact.</comment>
