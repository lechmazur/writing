<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's awe is present, but their personality lacks depth beyond reverence for stars and the moral dilemma; motivation is clear but not nuanced enough to feel truly human or distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a striking, evocative setting that enhances the mood of isolation; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the tear at the end, but relies too much on telling over showing; symbolism of the veil and idol is intriguing but underdeveloped for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the concept of emotion resurrection is unique, the execution leans on predictable sci-fi tropes of sterile futures; language occasionally feels ornate, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style sometimes obscures clarity with overwrought phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a deeply resonant one.</comment>
