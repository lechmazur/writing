<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a sincere rebel is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond determination and bitterness; her voice feels generic despite dialogue, missing nuanced individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of theorizing fits within the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some shifts in the passage’s nature lack clear cause-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms create a cohesive, eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details like the scent of rain, effectively supporting the tone and motivation, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Maya’s resolve, and the ending is satisfying, but literary devices like metaphors are underwhelming, and the central conflict lacks deeper subtext or complexity beyond surface stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on predictable haunted house tropes without subversion; sensory details are present but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown, lacking a unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with decent integration of elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a faint lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
