<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around tasting the stars and breaking generational patterns is intriguing, but the "closed-off" trait of the reaver feels underdeveloped and lacks distinct impact on actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the reaver's decision and the action of nagging via poems is not fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope park setting is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing the reflective mood, though its connection to the timeframe "before the first lie" feels somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on generational trauma and obsession with effective symbolism in the drawing, but the ending lacks a stronger emotional punch; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery (e.g., tasting stars as ash) is fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable themes of family curses without significant subversion; emotional resonance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the drawing and park, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
