<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Maya's motivation to overcome prejudice is clear, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond her profession, and her voice is not distinctly memorable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with repetitive reflections, and the connection between beginning and end is weakened by overemphasis on internal monologue over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of decay, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully amplify Maya's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional impact and symbolism with the ticket punch, but the narrative leans too heavily on telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a powerful, lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable human-AI connection tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like decay are somewhat overused, and emotional expression feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive but not exceptional; assigned elements are integrated with moderate success, but the style lacks polish, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
