<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the hidden promise driving the swordsman’s actions, but the "fiercely apathetic" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently portrayed against his growing defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the meteor shower method, while creative, lacks sufficient grounding in the story’s logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery setting is evocative and enhances the sense of imprisonment, complemented by the celestial tone, though sensory details are sparse and could deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the swordsman’s escape, and the ending is purposeful, but it lacks deeper subtext or memorable literary devices to elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining meteors as a path to freedom, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes of escape and defiance without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length seems more a constraint than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking profound depth.</comment>
