<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for revenge is clear, but the "measured diplomat" trait feels underdeveloped and inconsistently reflected in actions; internal conflict lacks depth beyond stated emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and cause-effect links between decoding and personal transformation are vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story shows some originality in combining elements, but relies on predictable revenge tropes without subversion; sensory details are repetitive, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but lacks a lingering impact or depth; style is functional but not distinctive, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
