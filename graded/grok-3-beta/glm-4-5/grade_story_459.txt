<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s ability to see ghosts shapes his actions, but his motivation feels surface-level; the connection between his grief and ghost-seeing lacks depth. His reaction to the flower crown hints at backstory but doesn’t fully reveal character complexity. Actions align with motivation, but his personality lacks a distinct voice or nuanced layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The action of dissecting experiences drives the plot, but the ghost tour method feels underdeveloped within the word limit. There’s a beginning and end, but the middle lacks a strong arc or resolution. Pacing feels rushed, and coherence is disrupted by abrupt shifts between lab and tour settings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is unique and complements the tone of complex simplicity, but its connection to the flower crown and ghostly concept feels tenuous. Sensory details like silence and equipment hums enhance atmosphere, though more specific immersion is needed to fully support Marcus’s motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Marcus’s grief, but literary devices like the flower crown as a bridge feel forced. The perspective is somewhat unique, yet lacks deeper subtext. The ending feels incomplete, and conflict resolution is vague. Showing versus telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution relies on predictable ghost story tropes without subversion. Sensory details are somewhat generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than shown. Metaphors like the crown’s shimmer are overused, but there’s a hint of individual style in the setting choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral. Style is clear but lacks sophistication. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice. There’s creative thinking, but the narrative lacks a lingering impact or profound depth.</comment>
