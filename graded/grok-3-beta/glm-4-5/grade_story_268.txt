<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and "screaming silence" create a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and generic, failing to fully immerse or connect setting to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with war's price and ancient art, but emotional impact is shallow due to overt telling over showing; ending lacks punch, and dialogue feels stiff and utilitarian.</comment>
