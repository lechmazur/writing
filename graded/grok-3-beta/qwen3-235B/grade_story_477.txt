<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s “mindfully scattered” attribute shapes his actions uniquely, but his motivation to escape suppression feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; reactions to the telescope are intriguing but not revelatory of deeper character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is driven by innovation and unforeseen consequences with a clear arc despite the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links between cosmic signals and city awakening are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly realized with sensory details like warped bird songs and bioluminescent tendrils, enhancing the lucid frenzy tone; however, the setting’s connection to the telescope feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (sword as individuality, static as rebellion) evoke thought, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling over showing; central conflict is clear but lacks nuanced resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining cosmic signals with underwater ruins, but some metaphors (e.g., “shattered glass” bubbles) feel generic, and emotional depiction occasionally lacks nuance, bordering on formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering rebellious spark, but overly ornate style sometimes obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
