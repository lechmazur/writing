<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thaddeus's grumpiness is evident and shapes his initial reluctance, but his deeper emotional transformation feels somewhat abrupt given the word limit; motivation is clear, though his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue or narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to resolution via the mandala is coherent and well-paced within constraints, but the action of "jiggle" feels peripheral to driving key plot moments, slightly undermining momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch's scrying room and stargazing timeframe blend seamlessly to create a haunting, mystical atmosphere; sensory details like fractured starlight are evocative, though some connections between setting and object feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mandala as trauma) and imagery evokes reflection on healing; the ending is satisfying, but emotional depth occasionally leans on telling over showing, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on trauma via the mandala, some metaphors (e.g., "constellation waiting to be named") feel overused; emotional handling is nuanced at times but occasionally stated too explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of trauma and mandala; style is mostly clear but veers into ornate at times, and the brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering resonance.</comment>
