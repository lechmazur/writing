<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila's background as a former child star informs her obsessive ambition, but her motivations feel somewhat surface-level, lacking deeper emotional nuance beyond the trope of a fallen star. Her "authentically odd" trait is vivid in appearance but doesn't fully shape her actions or voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the treasure map driving the action toward the vault's discovery. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between vibration analysis and the cathedral's secrets lacks logical grounding, creating minor coherence issues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-turned-lab setting is evocative, with strong sensory details like the stained-glass vibrations and mildew scent enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The tone of irreverent awe complements the wild magic concept, though the vibration chamber feels underutilized as a setting element.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of tragic ambition through Lila's descent, with potent imagery like the fractured reflections. However, the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of her past traumas rather than showing through subtler subtext. The ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of occult and acoustic elements, it leans on predictable tropes of the "mad artist" without enough subversion. Metaphors like "cosmic audition" are fresh, but some sensory details feel generic, and emotional resonance lacks depth in character reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative integration of wild magic and vibration analysis. However, the style occasionally veers into over-ornamentation, hindering clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice. It leaves a lingering unease, though not profound depth.</comment>
