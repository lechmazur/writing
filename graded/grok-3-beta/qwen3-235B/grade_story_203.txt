<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the exorcist’s stage fright and familial burden, but the internal conflict lacks depth; reactions to the wildflower feel symbolic yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with submersion driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting is evocative and complements the defiant tone; sensory details like frost-cloud and static are strong, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (wildflower, ashes) create subtext about legacy, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on metaphor over raw character reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in blending exorcism with sci-fi, but metaphors like “silence coiled like a noose” feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite many elements, with creative integration, but style sometimes leans overly ornate, hindering clarity; lingering impact is moderate but not profound.</comment>
