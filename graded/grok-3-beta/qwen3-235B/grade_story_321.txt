<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jorran’s motivation to rewrite the past out of guilt is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond remorse, and his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and causal links between actions and outcomes are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen setting is vividly described with sensory details like scorched sugar, enhancing the abrasive tone and supporting Jorran’s guilt, though the timeframe’s integration feels abstract and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Jorran’s sacrifice and uses strong imagery, but the central conflict resolves too neatly, and the theme of forgiveness, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity to truly resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers some originality in the hourglass mechanism, metaphors like “curdled milk” feel overused, and emotional depth relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the ribbon and hourglass, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
