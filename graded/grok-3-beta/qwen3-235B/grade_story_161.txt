<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The orchardist’s vigilance and personal tragedy are well-integrated into his motivations, driving his obsessive pursuit of truth. However, his personality lacks depth beyond this single-mindedness, and his dialogue, while impactful, feels slightly theatrical rather than fully authentic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the conspiracy driving the narrative forward logically. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution—vanishing into the night—lacks grounding, undermining the sense of completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is vividly described as a “hangar-sized cathedral,” enhancing the atmosphere of ambition and secrecy. Sensory details are effective, but the orchard setting at the end feels underutilized and disconnected from the main action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and grief through strong imagery (e.g., folding grief into origami birds), and the central conflict is clear. However, the ending feels more dramatic than satisfying, and emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique blend of personal loss and espionage, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “overripe fruit splitting open”) feel slightly overused. Emotional nuance is present but not fully developed, and the tone occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the seal and conspiracy. However, the style sometimes prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting emotional impact.</comment>
