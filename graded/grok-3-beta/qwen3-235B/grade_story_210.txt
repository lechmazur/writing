<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The amiable scholar's personality is hinted at through their determination and intellectual curiosity, but their amiability feels underexplored and lacks depth in interactions or internal conflict; motivation is clear but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with the crossword as a central device, but pacing feels uneven with dense exposition crowding the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt given the tight word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly realized with sensory details like salt-crusted windows and groaning timbers, creating a strong atmosphere that enhances the tone of mystery and isolation; minor disconnect between setting and timeframe phrasing weakens full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its symbolism of light and shadow, with a satisfying ending; literary devices like metaphor are effective, though some imagery borders on overwrought; central conflict is present but lacks deeper emotional resonance due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending crossword-solving with supernatural elements, and metaphors are mostly fresh; however, some phrases feel ornate and risk purple prose, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the crossword and lighthouse; style occasionally hinders clarity with dense language; it leaves a lingering thought about rebuilding, but brevity feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
