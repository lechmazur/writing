<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the mercenary's haunted past driving his search for peace, but the "carefully reckless" attribute feels underexplored in shaping specific actions; his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between rumor and discovery, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution with the artist lacks depth for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details like spray paint and incense enhancing the collapsed cathedral setting; tone of longing complements the concept, though the timeframe's "echoing hour" integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with amber and spider, evoking emotional resonance and subtext about guilt; however, dialogue feels stilted, and the central conflict resolves too abruptly to feel fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor and thematic depth with amber as trapped memory, but reliance on familiar "haunted soldier" tropes without subversion and occasional generic descriptors diminish uniqueness; tone remains consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like amber and cathedral, leaving a lingering melancholic thought; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity, and brevity feels slightly limiting.</comment>
