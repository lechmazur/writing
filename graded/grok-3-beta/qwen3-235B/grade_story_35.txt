<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener's quiet nature shapes his isolation and observational role effectively, but his motivation to understand emotions feels underdeveloped until the final moments, lacking deeper internal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to emotional connection is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the purse’s role as a catalyst is logical, yet pacing suffers from overpacked imagery, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting of the translation center enhances the theme of unspoken connection, and sensory details like bird calls create atmosphere, though the timeframe integration feels incidental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes longing and reflection through symbolism of the purse and retreat, but the emotional impact is diluted by overwrought metaphors; subtext is present but not fully layered or satisfying at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some imagery (e.g., flickering silk) feels generic rather than fresh; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, lacking a truly unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it lingers somewhat with its theme of shared wounds, yet the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
