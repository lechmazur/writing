<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to save the village is clear, and the pragmatic soothsayer's blend of foresight and practicality is intriguing, but their inner conflict and personal voice feel underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc from desperation to sacrifice, driven by the act of manufacturing a miracle, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the cause-effect link between the song’s echo and the plowshare’s power lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village setting is vividly realized with sensory details like "rot-blackened earth" and "charred violets," enhancing the dreadful hope tone, though the timeframe’s integration feels more poetic than concrete.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (hammer as relic, plowshare as storm) evoke thought, and the ending lingers with sacrifice, but emotional resonance is somewhat undercut by overt telling of the toll rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like "hunger of storms," but occasional purple prose ("sapphire choked on whispered curses") and predictable sacrifice trope without subversion detract from originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the lingering impact feels more intellectual than emotional.</comment>
