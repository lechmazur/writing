<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the lantern and the core’s reactivation, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the descent, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Mars biodome setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like crimson dust and sterile corridors, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation, though the connection between setting and lantern feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
