<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Elias Vorne’s zealotry is evident and drives his obsession with legacy, but his deeper emotional layers and personal history feel underexplored, lacking nuanced internal conflict beyond his grandfather’s influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and tragic end, but pacing feels uneven; the buildup to the climax is rushed, and some cause-effect links, like the soldiers’ sudden arrival, lack grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The strange attractor laboratory and shifting powers timeframe create a compelling, tense atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like burnt bergamot; however, the setting’s potential to deepen the story’s mood is not fully exploited.</comment>
