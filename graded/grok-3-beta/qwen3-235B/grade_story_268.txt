<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the vigilante’s drive for vengeance tied to past trauma, but the “subdued” trait feels inconsistently portrayed amidst intense actions; lacks a distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the mirror’s mechanics are underexplained, causing minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of desolation in the abandoned waiting area enhances the tone of loss and war’s aftermath; sensory details like shattered windows and dust are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the mirror and bead, evoking emotional resonance around war’s cost; ending is purposeful but dialogue feels utilitarian; subtext is present but not fully layered for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the mirror-distortion concept, but reliance on war trauma tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh, though emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering sense of tragedy, though not profoundly unique or thought-provoking.</comment>
