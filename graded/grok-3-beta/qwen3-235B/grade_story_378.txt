<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Boran’s grumpiness is distinct and shapes his voice, but his motivation feels somewhat vague beyond a general sense of duty; reactions to the beetle reveal curiosity, yet deeper emotional stakes are underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the swamp’s renewal, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are mostly logical, though the monks’ sudden return lacks setup, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The polluted swamp orchard is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of reluctant awe; however, the setting’s connection to the timeframe of dawn feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (beetle as transformation) are effective, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by surface-level character depth; central conflict exists but lacks intensity within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story shows originality in combining elements like the clockwork beetle and swamp renewal, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptors feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but clarity suffers from underdeveloped character stakes; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
