<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo’s aloofness and orphan background shape their detached efficiency and survival instincts, but their motivation lacks depth beyond a generic need to adapt; the reaction to the stones shows some personal history, though their voice remains indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the anomaly’s resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between loosening stones and resolving the anomaly is logical yet underwhelming, lacking a stronger causal thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The garage setting and gravitational anomaly create a striking, eerie atmosphere with vivid sensory details like floating objects; however, the tone’s affectionate detachment occasionally clashes with the anomaly’s surreal intensity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with Milo’s tentative hope, supported by symbolism of stones and anomaly; the ending is satisfying, but subtext feels surface-level, lacking deeper thematic resonance or provocative reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the anomaly and stones offer some originality, the orphan-survivor trope feels predictable without subversion; metaphors like “constellation of calm” are fresh, but emotional nuance is stated more than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but not distinctive, and while it leaves a lingering feeling of hope, it lacks profound depth or creative spark.</comment>
