<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode universal patterns is clear, but the emissary's personality feels underdeveloped; their unease is stated but not deeply explored through distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the capsule's trajectory and personal redemption, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between events are poetic but sometimes lack clear cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the orbital station is vividly realized with sensory details like rustling postcards and mechanical hums, enhancing the atmosphere; tone of accidental wisdom aligns well with the concept, though some connections feel overly symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery with postcards and debris as symbols of redemption; emotional impact is present but occasionally diluted by overwriting; ending is satisfying but not fully resonant due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story offers originality in combining debris tracking with personal redemption, but metaphors like "branches" and "constellation" verge on clich√© without fresh subversion; emotional nuance is present but sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration of postcards and debris; style occasionally overcomplicates clarity with ornate language; leaves a lingering thought, though not as sharply as it could with tighter focus.</comment>
