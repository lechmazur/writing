<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli's character as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, and their motivation to understand and release spirits is clear, but their "elegantly clumsy" attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied, missing deeper integration into their actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily. The connection between Eli’s actions and the ghost’s release is logical, yet the story struggles with coherence in tying the lab to the elevator shaft seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab and the oceanic decay outside create a haunting atmosphere that supports the story’s tone of loss and memory. Sensory details like crunching sand and sterile lights are evocative, though the setting’s connection to the timeframe (lunch breaks) feels underutilized and incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant reflection on letting go, with effective symbolism in the crumbling sand castle and the flower crown. However, the emotional impact is muted by occasional telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch to linger with the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending ghostly elements with sand castle preservation, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., "time forgiving itself") feel slightly overwrought. Emotional resonance is present but not fully nuanced, with moments of stated feelings rather than subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a level of cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, leaving a lingering thought about memory and release. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and overall impact.</comment>
