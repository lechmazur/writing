<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the apothecary’s drive to protect the butterflies and decode signals, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "wayward" trope. Her voice lacks distinctiveness, and reactions to the pen and past lover are more functional than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the signal infection driving tension, but pacing feels rushed toward the resolution. Cause and effect are logical, yet the rival’s manifesto introduction is abrupt, disrupting coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting is vividly realized with sensory details like groaning hulls and flickering pens, enhancing the battered marvel tone. Atmosphere supports the concept of unconventional love, though some connections between setting and character motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought with its theme of love as action, supported by strong imagery like butterflies stitching the dark. However, dialogue is minimal and lacks depth, and emotional impact relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions. Ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in blending steampunk and bioluminescence, with fresh metaphors, but occasional purple prose (e.g., “fragile, furious light”) detracts. Emotional handling is somewhat stated rather than shown, and some descriptors feel generic rather than vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the pen and butterflies, leaving a lingering sense of defiance. However, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice in fully fleshing out themes.</comment>
