<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thorne's stoic nature and ironically earnest actions are well-portrayed, especially in returning the wallet, but his sudden emotional vulnerability lacks sufficient buildup, undermining consistency in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing is uneven—key emotional shifts are rushed, disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The beekeeper's sanctuary is vividly realized with sensory details like humming bees and amber combs, enhancing atmosphere, though the bar setting feels underdeveloped by comparison.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (bees as lost things) and imagery adds depth, and the ending is poignant, but emotional impact is diluted by occasional over-telling of Thorne’s feelings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, others (rogue wave, message in a bottle) lean on cliché, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown at critical moments, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but uneven pacing and occasional overwrought language hinder clarity and impact.</comment>
