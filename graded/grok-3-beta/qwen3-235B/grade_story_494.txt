<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman’s personality is distinct, with arrogance and doubt clashing effectively in his actions and dialogue, but his deeper motivation feels underdeveloped within the tight word count, lacking nuanced exploration beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the act of singing, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the tapestry and the sword’s ignition lacks deeper causal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard is evocative and ties well to the tone of harsh tenderness, with sensory details like gravel crunching enhancing immersion, though the setting’s broader connection to the tapestry feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (tapestry as legacy, song as surrender) add depth, and the ending resonates, but emotional impact is uneven due to limited character depth, and some dialogue feels slightly forced rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on legacy and arrogance, some metaphors (e.g., “cleaving steel”) feel overused, and emotional portrayal occasionally leans on explicit statement rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like song and tapestry, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but overall clarity is hindered by rushed emotional beats and underdeveloped subtext, falling short of top-tier impact.</comment>
