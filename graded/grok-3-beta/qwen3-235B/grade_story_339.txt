<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with guilt and relief over her brother’s accident, but the joyless performer’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond her remorse; her stage past lacks depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with organizing debris driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some reflective moments drag while key emotional beats are rushed; coherence is maintained but not seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prismatic lake and construction setting create a vivid, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details (e.g., fractured dawn, seesaw squeak); tone supports guilt, though connection between setting and character motivation could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through guilt and loss, with strong imagery (lake reflections, drawer knob symbolism); ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying; subtext is present but central conflict resolution lacks punch within word constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors (cranes as skeletal sentinels), but some phrases verge on overwrought; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown; no major clichés, yet not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative; style supports clarity but brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate; lingering guilt offers depth, though impact is not fully memorable.</comment>
