<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to save his sister is clear, but the fretful nature feels inconsistently portrayed against bold actions; lacks a distinct voice or deeper personality nuance beyond the surface conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a complete arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the potion's effect; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ancient Egyptian palace setting is evocative with sensory details like flickering torches and pulsing murals; atmosphere supports the daring caution tone well, though sensory depth could be more consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the sister’s fading image and uses potent imagery like the kaleidoscope of scenes; ending is satisfying, but subtext on storytelling feels slightly heavy-handed and not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors, like “subtitles’ ghosts,” are fresh, but others, such as “sunrise bled gold,” are clichéd; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like subtitles and the recipe; leaves a lingering thought on storytelling, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
