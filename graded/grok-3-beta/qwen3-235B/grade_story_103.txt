<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The knight's weathered nature shapes his stoic resolve, and his motivation to confront regret is clear, but his personality lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice beyond archetypal grimness. Actions align with motivation, yet internal conflict feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, sacrificing depth for resolution. Cause and effect are logical, yet the connection between elements and plot progression occasionally feels contrived within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere that enhances the tone of regret and isolation. Sensory details like salt spray and sea screams are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirrors, serpent knocker) and a poignant ending evoke reflection on choice and loss, but emotional resonance is undercut by occasionally explicit rather than shown feelings. The central conflict is clear, though subtext lacks consistent depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on regret via mirrors, some metaphors (e.g., "fly in amber") feel familiar, and emotional handling leans toward stated rather than nuanced. Style is distinct but occasionally slips into ornate prose, risking clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the lighthouse and choices theme. However, style sometimes prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
