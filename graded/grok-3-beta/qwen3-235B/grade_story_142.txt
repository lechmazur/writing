<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Julian's portrayal as a broke aristocrat is clear, and his motivation to reclaim his family’s legacy drives his actions consistently, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single-minded pursuit, and his voice feels somewhat generic despite the aristocratic context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the cause-effect links between the coaster’s secrets and Julian’s choices are not fully fleshed out, leading to minor coherence gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like the ghostly hum and rusted tracks, enhancing the tone of blurry vividness, though the connection between the setting and the botanical illustration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a lingering melancholy and uses strong imagery like the cereus blooming in light, but the emotional depth is undercut by explicit stating of themes (e.g., surrendering bitterness) rather than showing through nuanced subtext; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of an alchemical legacy in a haunted coaster is intriguing, the story leans on familiar gothic tropes without significant subversion, and some metaphors (e.g., ink in water) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but not consistently deep.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive narrative with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity sometimes feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
