<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to right a cosmic imbalance is clear, but the shy nature of the diviner feels underexplored and inconsistent with bold actions like social media posting; lacks distinct voice or depth in reaction to photographs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness with a clear beginning and resolution, driven by the action of precipitating a fix, though pacing feels rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained but cause-effect links between timelines are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Underwater city market setting is evocative with bioluminescent details enhancing mood; atmosphere supports regret and imbalance, though sensory immersion could be deeper with varied tactile or olfactory cues.</comment>
