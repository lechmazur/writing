<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to "sow seeds of a better tomorrow" is clear, but the "suspiciously trusting" attribute feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in influencing actions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the cryptid theme and mirror imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., smoke curling into an eye) feel forced, and emotional depth lacks nuanced showing over telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
