<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the smuggler’s drive to map tunnels and past mercies, but the "logically emotional" attribute feels underexplored, lacking depth in internal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the countdown driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links (e.g., tunnel collapse) are vague, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like jasmine and damp soil, enhancing the whispering gallery setting; however, the timeframe’s integration with mood feels slightly forced, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through survival themes and symbolism of the key, with a satisfying ending, but lacks emotional depth in character reactions and over-relies on telling over showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "survival was art" feel generic; emotional nuance is present but inconsistent, and prose occasionally veers into ornate, detracting from impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering question about the maps’ impact, but style occasionally obscures clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
