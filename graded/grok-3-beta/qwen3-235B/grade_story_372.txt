<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a lovelorn spy is clear, driven by past betrayal and loss, but the emotional depth feels surface-level; reactions to the sticky label are symbolic yet underdeveloped, lacking a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the serum injection; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of futuristic city slums is vividly rendered with sensory details like neon haze and drone-smog, enhancing atmosphere and supporting tone; however, the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of loss and reinvention, with strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., fractured visor), but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch; conflict is present but resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While imagery like “smeared constellations” shows originality, some metaphors feel overwrought; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the sticky label and slums, leaving a lingering sense of loss, but overly ornate style occasionally hinders clarity; brevity feels somewhat limiting.</comment>
