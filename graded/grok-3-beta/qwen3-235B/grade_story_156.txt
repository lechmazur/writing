<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the diplomat’s confusion and desire to understand the village, but the personality lacks depth beyond the assigned trait, and reactions to the key feel symbolic rather than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations at the terminal; cause and effect are logical yet the bird patterns as a method feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the eerie salt mine village is vividly rendered with sensory details like “brine-slick corridors,” enhancing atmosphere and supporting the tone, though timeframe integration during bus rides feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought with themes of secrecy and wisdom, bolstered by imagery like murmurations, but emotional resonance is weakened by overt telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in linking bird patterns to governance, but metaphors like “counterpoint of hearts” feel forced and generic; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the key and setting, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; lingering impact is present but muted by uneven depth.</comment>
