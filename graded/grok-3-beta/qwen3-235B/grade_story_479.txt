<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mireille’s characterization as a glamorous undertaker is intriguing, and her fruitless patience shapes her resigned yet dedicated demeanor, but her motivations lack deeper personal stakes or conflict beyond the abstract preservation of tradition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a clear arc centered on elongating a body, but the tech mogul’s request feels like a shallow catalyst, and pacing suffers from overpacked thematic musings that disrupt narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere of jubilant remorse is well-crafted with evocative details like cerulean paint and glowing runes, enhancing the tone, though the social network archive setting feels underutilized as a mere backdrop rather than an integrated world element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on legacy and ordinariness through strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels more melancholic than purposeful, and the central conflict of tradition versus modernity lacks sharp tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its concept of elongating bodies as spiritual translation, with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance is stated more than shown through nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering thought about legacy, but overly complex language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
