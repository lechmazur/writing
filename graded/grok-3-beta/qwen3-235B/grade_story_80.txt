<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's daring nature is evident, but motivation feels underdeveloped and reactions to the riddle lack depth; the "ingeniously clueless" trait is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a creative resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links (like the mirrors shattering) are abrupt and unexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned roller coaster is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing the eerie tone; atmosphere supports the quiet mania well, though timeframe integration is vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and some awe, with effective symbolism (doorknob as key/shadow as answer), but ending feels slightly forced; subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "earth grinding its teeth" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; length feels managed, yet depth is sacrificed for flourish.</comment>
