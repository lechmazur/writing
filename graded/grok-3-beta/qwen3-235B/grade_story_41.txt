<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's cosmic powers and academic wildness are intriguing, but their motivations feel underdeveloped and their reactions somewhat generic, lacking a distinct personal voice or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between actions and outcomes occasionally lacks clarity within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terrace and abyss create a striking atmosphere with vivid imagery, enhancing the cosmic tone, though sensory details are unevenly applied and sometimes overly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original elements like the cosmic factory worker are undermined by some predictable tropes around hidden powers and family heirlooms; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often lean on familiar cosmic imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style sometimes overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a fully lingering impact.</comment>
