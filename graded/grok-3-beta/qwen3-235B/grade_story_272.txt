<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's social awkwardness is evident but underdeveloped; motivation to undo regret feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding, though the whistle interaction reveals some inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the concept of forgotten arts drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the all-night diner enhances the restless tone and supports the characterâ€™s isolation; sensory details like clattering dishes are evocative, though some setting elements feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a bittersweet response with strong imagery like the "tree of regret"; subtext is present but not fully layered; ending is purposeful, though dialogue feels slightly utilitarian.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on overwritten; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of renewal; however, style occasionally obscures clarity, and brevity feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
