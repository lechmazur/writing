<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thalia’s motivation to uncover hidden truth is clear, but her identity as a back-alley puppeteer feels underexplored beyond symbolic gestures like stitching; her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the temple’s collapse, are abrupt and unexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Greek temple setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like burnt myrrh and dried laurel, enhancing the tone of intimate solitude, though its connection to the puzzle event feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Thalia’s grief and betrayal, with strong imagery and symbolism in the gowns and stamps; however, the ending feels overwrought, diluting its impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates many elements cohesively and shows creative thinking in combining stamps and gowns, but overly complex prose sometimes hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully.</comment>
