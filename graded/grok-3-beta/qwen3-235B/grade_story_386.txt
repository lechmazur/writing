<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear—to mend time’s wound—but lacks depth in personal stakes beyond the abstract; her strangeness and trustworthiness are evident but underdeveloped in personal interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit; pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, but causality and flow are logical and engaging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly realized with evocative sensory details (salt plains, ozone scent); the atom-powered lighthouse enhances the tone of borrowed dawn, though the temporal scar’s visual impact could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tablecloth as time’s fabric) and imagery evokes thought; ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance is slightly muted by lack of intimate character insight; conflict is clear and well-handled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing is original with fresh metaphors, but some phrases (e.g., “cracked porcelain”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully grounded in specific character reactions, risking a generic sheen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements; style supports clarity, though complexity occasionally overshadows emotional impact; leaves a lingering question about Vael, but depth feels slightly constrained by length.</comment>
