<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode star maps for water is clear and consistent with the "uniquely literal" trait, but depth is limited; reactions and actions align with this trait, yet lack nuanced emotional layers or distinct voice beyond determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, driven by overcharging the transmitter, though pacing is unevenâ€”rushed climax disrupts flow, and cause-effect feels slightly forced with ghostly elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse basement and post-war timeframe mesh well, enhancing the eerie tone and motivation; sensory details like damp stone and humming air are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity to fully immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through themes of hope and perseverance; imagery and symbolism (star maps, water) add depth, but ending feels slightly predictable, and conflict resolution lacks sharper tension or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining elements like star maps and water wars, with some fresh metaphors, but relies on tropes of ghostly guardians and lone savior without subversion; emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, showing creative thinking in combining lighthouse and star maps; style supports clarity, but lacks a deeply lingering impact or question beyond the surface triumph.</comment>
