<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli's disgruntled nature and motivation to out-face ghostly judgments are clear, but his "intensely relaxed" attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between corroborating truth and shadow patterns is tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere of inherited mystery is evocative, with the well and escape route enhancing mood, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion through tactile or auditory elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Eli’s reconciliation with his father’s legacy, and symbolism of scars is potent, but the ending feels predictable, and subtext remains underdeveloped for a truly impactful narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in the wishing-well agent concept, metaphors like shadows as cloaks are overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, lacking a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a lingering sense of resolution, and elements are mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity, and creative depth feels constrained by the brevity.</comment>
