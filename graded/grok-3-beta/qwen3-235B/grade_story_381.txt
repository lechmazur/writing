<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems and find the Heart of Glass is clear, but the hushed necromancer's personality lacks depth beyond quiet determination; reactions to the baseball cap and old movies feel symbolic but not deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; tunnel collapses and warnings lack impactful buildup, making some turns abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Crystalline cave is vividly described with sensory details like bioluminescent fungi and dripping water, enhancing atmosphere; however, the futuristic nostalgia tone occasionally clashes with the ancient, mystical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on memory and remembrance through the Heart of Glass, with strong imagery like film projections on crystal walls; yet, emotional depth is stated more than shown, and dialogue feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with creative use of film references, but some metaphors (e.g., "sound of resolve") feel overworked and predictable; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with thoughtful integration of elements like old movies and the cave, leaving a lingering idea of remembrance; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
