<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the astronomer's drive to dismantle fear-driven doctrine, but her personality feels underdeveloped; her awe is stated rather than deeply felt, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are occasionally abstract rather than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details of ice, light, and frost, strongly supporting the tone and concept; however, the lighthouse orchard's connection to the action feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection through layered symbolism and a satisfying ending, with strong use of metaphors like the veil and snowflakes; yet, emotional resonance is somewhat muted by over-reliance on abstract language over visceral showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in imagery and concept, avoiding most clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "cathedral of cracks") feel slightly overwrought, and emotional depth lacks human nuance at times, bordering on formulaic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope and reflection; however, overly ornate style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
