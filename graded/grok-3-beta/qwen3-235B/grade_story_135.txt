<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eira’s ambition as a brewer turned linguist is clear, and her motivation to document dying dialects is consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of deciphering the poster driving the story forward, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links, like the elders’ sudden relenting, are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, immersive setting with strong sensory details like groaning gears and biting frost, effectively supporting the mood of peculiar faith, though the connection between setting and object feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on language preservation and uses imagery effectively (bruises as constellation), with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict with elders feels resolved too easily, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of lost dialects and paths is unique, some metaphors (e.g., brew stronger than crafted) feel slightly overused, and Eira’s emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced; the style is distinctive but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the straw and poster, leaving a lingering thought about language’s endurance, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels slightly limiting.</comment>
