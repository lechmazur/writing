<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a roguish minstrel with surging ideals is clear, but the "spontaneously cautious" attribute feels underexplored in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed resolutions; cause and effect of galvanizing via carvings is logical yet lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Underwater coral reef city is vividly realized with sensory details like neon anemones and salt-crusted lutes, enhancing atmosphere and supporting the quiet revolution tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (apron as shroud/banner) add depth, but emotional resonance is muted by over-telling ideals rather than showing nuanced reactions; ending feels purposeful yet not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original setting and concept of consciousness patterns in coral are inventive, but some metaphors (e.g., "ghosts of the surface world") feel generic; emotional nuance exists but is inconsistently shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the apron and carvings, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully.</comment>
