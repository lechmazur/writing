<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Livia’s motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this yearning; her voice is indistinct, and reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the sewing box driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between poltergeist activity and resolution are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Roman villa setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like marble shards and lavender scent, enhancing atmosphere, though the integration of modern elements like QR codes feels jarring against the historical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Livia’s longing and the cameo reveal, with some effective symbolism, but subtext is underdeveloped, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality with the ancestral connection, some metaphors like "shadows pooling like ink" are overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
