<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ghostly caretaker's solemnly silly attribute feels inconsistently applied, with moments of whimsy clashing with deeper melancholy; motivation to communicate with animals is clear but lacks depth in execution, feeling more whimsical than profound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the perforation of logs driving action, but pacing feels rushed toward the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though the ending's sudden spring feels slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen orchard and geothermal streams create a vivid, contrasting setting that enhances the ghostly atmosphere; sensory details like "steam cyclones" and "icicles melting" are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., trees shedding ice as rebirth) evoke thought, and the ending is poignant with "Ask better questions"; however, emotional resonance is undercut by occasionally overwrought language and lack of nuanced conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its surreal blend of elements, with fresh metaphors like "geyser laughter"; yet, some phrasing feels overly ornate, verging on purple prose, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown in key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about fate and connection; however, the style occasionally sacrifices clarity for florid description, and the brief length feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
