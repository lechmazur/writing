<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias's meekness and sincerity shape his interactions with goblin children effectively, but his motivation to mend his soul feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the decoding of the tapestry as a central action, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat tenuous due to abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with sensory details like playground sounds and bioluminescent lichen, enhancing the mystic tone, though the setting's connection to Elias's motivation remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective tone with imagery and symbolism around regeneration, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition rather than showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of necromancy and mystic simplicity, some metaphors feel forced or generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the broken pen and dewdrop, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
