<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliane’s forgetfulness is intriguing but inconsistently developed; her shift to sharp focus feels abrupt and unearned, lacking depth in motivation beyond the surface-level desire to protect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with negotiation driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution with developers is too tidy for the story’s complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The champagne vault is evocatively described, with sensory details like trembling bass notes enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and stained-glass fragment could be more symbolically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about preservation versus progress, with some effective imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by detached narration, and the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality in combining elements, some metaphors (e.g., “tiny sun”) feel slightly overused, and Eliane’s emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, bordering on formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of soundwaves and preservation, but the detached style occasionally hinders clarity and emotional resonance, leaving the impact somewhat shallow.</comment>
