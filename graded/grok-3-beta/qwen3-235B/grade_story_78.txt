<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to loss and resolve is clear, but the "late-blooming" aspect feels underexplored; actions align with a militant grief, yet the voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; coercion drives the narrative, though some cause-effect links are overly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic rooftop farm enhances desolation and stakes effectively; sensory details like "brittle solar panels" immerse, though atmosphere occasionally overpowers character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance from grief and subtle symbolism of the spyglass stand out, but ending feels more poetic than conclusive; conflict resolution lacks sharpness despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh at times, but some metaphors like "cosmic balance" feel overwrought; emotional handling shows nuance, though occasional ornate language risks purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative use of the spyglass, but style sometimes obscures clarity; lingering impact is present but diluted by overambition in scope.</comment>
