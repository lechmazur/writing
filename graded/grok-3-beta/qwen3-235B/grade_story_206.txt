<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s vendetta drives her actions, and her creativity as a candy sculptor shapes her unique methods, but her emotional depth feels surface-level; her motivations are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict beyond scorn and loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; the counterattack and trail of photographs drive the narrative, though connections between clues and resolution are sometimes abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market and rebellion timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like molten sugar and bioluminescent flora, but the setting’s integration with character motivation feels uneven at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lirael’s loss and purpose, with strong symbolism in the sculptures and locket, but the ending feels slightly predictable; subtext is present but not fully layered for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the candy sculptor premise is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “scorn softened into purpose”) feel generic; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the tone occasionally shifts unnaturally, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
