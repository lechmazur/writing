<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve ritual practices is clear, and the gravedigger's steady yet whimsical nature shapes actions, but the personality lacks depth beyond archetypes; personal stakes are implied through the wifeâ€™s voice but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a ritual-driven resolution, but pacing feels rushed toward the climax, and cause-effect links between wind and rift-sealing are vague, undermining coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the reimagined Aztec temple is vivid and integral, with strong sensory details like copal and diesel; atmosphere of raucous silence enhances mood, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through overlapping worlds and memory themes, with strong imagery, but emotional impact is muted by stated rather than shown feelings; ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality in blending ancient and modern is notable, but some metaphors (e.g., "laughing gods") feel generic; emotional nuance is lacking, and prose occasionally veers into ornate without purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style leans overly complex at times, hindering clarity; lingering thought is present but not profound enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
