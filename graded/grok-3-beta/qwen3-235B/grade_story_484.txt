<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The brewer’s grogginess and stubborn motivation to embody his values are clear and drive his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the thematic brewing metaphors; his voice, while distinct, feels more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a loose arc with the descent and confrontation of darkness, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and the resolution is abrupt; cause and effect are logical, though the protest connection remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting and encroaching darkness concept create a strong atmosphere with vivid sensory details like frostbitten thistle and wet wool; however, the protest timeframe feels tacked on and disrupts tonal coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through brewing as a metaphor for resilience, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending lacks emotional punch; dialogue is minimal but fitting, though the central conflict’s resolution feels more poetic than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers originality in blending brewing with supernatural defiance, metaphors like “fermented values” occasionally veer into overuse; emotional nuance exists but often leans on explicit imagery rather than subtle showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mirror and staircase, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity; it leaves a lingering theme of stubborn light, yet the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
