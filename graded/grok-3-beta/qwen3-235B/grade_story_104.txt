<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stoic steward’s personality is adequately portrayed through his silent rebellion and disdain for conformity, but his inner motivations lack depth and emotional nuance, making his actions feel somewhat mechanical rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger on imagery while key actions like planting the seed feel rushed; logical flow is present but not seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The miniature world museum and orchard setting are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like overripe apples and bruised fruit, enhancing the cynical tone and atmosphere of decay, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through its themes of defiance and decay, with strong use of metaphor (cracks, cameo as armor), but the ending feels more symbolic than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique setting, some metaphors (e.g., cracks in the façade) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but stated more than shown, and the style, though distinct, occasionally verges on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about rebellion, but the style sometimes prioritizes imagery over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
