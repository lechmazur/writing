<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the sentinel’s duty tied to their sister’s legacy, but their personality lacks depth beyond the dutiful archetype, and their voice isn’t distinct enough in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the detonator and lab destruction isn’t fully logical or explained within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly primal with evocative imagery of green-tinged explosions and dawn, effectively supporting the tone, though sensory details are uneven and the lab setting feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (stories as algae) and subtext about erasure adds depth, but emotional resonance is limited by abrupt pacing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in blending bioweapons with photosynthesis, but metaphors like “serrated smile” feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
