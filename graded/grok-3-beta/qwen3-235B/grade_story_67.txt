<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eliasâ€™s drive to tame darkness tied to personal loss, but the "jovial" trait feels inconsistently portrayed amidst his grief, lacking depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning (loss), middle (struggle), and end (resolve), but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between action and resolution is somewhat forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The attic setting is vividly realized with sensory details (dust motes, groaning space) that enhance mood, though the timeframe of the train window feels more symbolic than integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and metaphor (darkness as hunger, light singing) creates emotional resonance, but the ending lacks full satisfaction, and the theme of endurance feels underexplored in subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor (shadows as scalded animals), but reliance on familiar grief tropes and overly ornate phrasing ("feverish belief") detracts from authenticity and risks feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
