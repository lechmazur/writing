<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hesitant swordsman’s awkwardness is portrayed consistently, but his motivations feel vague and underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional stakes. His interaction with the postcard is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, especially the queen’s transformation. Cause and effect are mostly logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a striking, immersive setting with vivid sensory details. The atmosphere complements the tone of ephemeral rancor well, though the mirrored underworld feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative mood through symbolism (postcard, crabs), and the ending is purposeful. However, dialogue feels stilted, and the central conflict lacks emotional punch due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its surreal imagery and concept of bridging worlds, avoiding blatant clichés. However, some metaphors (e.g., crabs as bridge) feel slightly forced, and emotional resonance relies more on description than nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. Yet, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
