<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's selective muteness and ventriloquism are intriguing but underexplored as motivators; their voice breaking at the climax feels abrupt without deeper emotional groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with the coffee sleeve and storm archiving, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the universe-folding concept introduces incoherence under the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Parallel universe beach is vividly described with turquoise tides and fractal umbrellas, enhancing the surreal tone; sensory details are strong, though atmosphere occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity with weather-as-universe metaphor and redefining family theme, but emotional impact is diluted by overpacked ideas; dialogue through Salty feels purposeful yet slightly gimmicky.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in combining ventriloquism with weather archiving, but metaphors like “frothy origami” feel forced; emotional resonance lacks depth, relying on stated feelings over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative storm-family interplay, but style occasionally overreaches with dense imagery, hindering clarity; lingering hope is present but not profound.</comment>
