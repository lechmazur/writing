<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to overcoming prejudice is clear, and the professional cuddler’s role shapes their empathetic yet conflicted nature, but the distinct voice is underdeveloped, and reactions to the ticket punch feel slightly forced rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness within word limit, with decay driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the punch and personal revelation are somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the abandoned spaceport hangar is vivid with sensory details like oxidized steel and flickering holograms, strongly supporting the tone of decay, though the timeframe’s integration feels tangential to the setting’s impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through themes of guilt and forgiveness, with strong symbolism in the ticket punch, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of the ticket punch as absolution, but some metaphors (e.g., “dawn bled orange”) are overused, and emotional resonance relies occasionally on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the ticket punch and decay, leaving a lingering question about unspoken rules, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
