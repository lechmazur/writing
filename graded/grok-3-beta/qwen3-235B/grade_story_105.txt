<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The outcast scholar's motivation to prove midnight's impermanence is clear and drives their actions, but their personality lacks depth beyond obsession, and their voice feels indistinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between soul-mirroring and midnight's impermanence is conceptually muddled, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The half-lit corridor and witch’s garage create a vivid, eerie atmosphere that complements the frantic peace tone, though sensory details are unevenly applied, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on identity and time through soul-mirroring, with strong symbolism in the shell, but the ending feels slightly forced, and dialogue lacks natural flow, diminishing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of soul-mirroring offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., stars winking) feel clichéd, and emotional resonance is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth in character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but overly ornate language occasionally obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
