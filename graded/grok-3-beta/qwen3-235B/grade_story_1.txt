<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's phobia is well-integrated into actions and reactions, shaping her struggle, but motivation feels slightly vague—dancing on the edge of madness lacks specificity. Voice is distinct but not fully developed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—some moments rushed, others overly dense. Cause and effect are logical, though connections between garage sales and pyramid feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details (mildew, echoes), enhancing the setting's eeriness. Pyramid library and tone mesh well, though garage sale timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the core setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes unease and reflection through symbolism (net as fears), with a satisfying ending. However, subtext is occasionally heavy-handed, and conflict resolution feels slightly pat despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh in places (net as mind), but some metaphors feel overwrought or generic ("abyss danced back"). Tone is consistent, yet emotional resonance leans on stated fears rather than nuanced showing at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought about fear's cyclical nature. Style supports impact but occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
