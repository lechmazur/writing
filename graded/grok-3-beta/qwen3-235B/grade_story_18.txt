<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathic nature shapes its actions compellingly, and its motivation to uncover truth is clear; however, its personality lacks depth beyond tragic longing, and reactions to the hair tie feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the recognition moment as a climax, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the weatherizing action lacks clear causal impact on the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like steam hisses and acid rain, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness; however, the setting's connection to telepathy and calligraphy feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the statue-archivist connection and uses strong imagery like "ink-stained vows," but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict lacks sustained tension within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "ribbon through decades of lies") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated longing than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of ink and recognition, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
