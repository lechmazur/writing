<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thatch’s motivation to uphold his oath is clear and consistent, shaping his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the apathetic tone; reactions to the fan reveal duty over emotion, yet his voice feels more atmospheric than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within the word limit with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing is uneven—early exposition drags while the climax rushes; cause and effect are logical, though coherence suffers from abrupt shifts in imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting of the fossilized giant is vividly realized with sensory details like rot and cracked earth, enhancing atmosphere and action; tone of fervent apathy aligns well with the desolate world, though some sensory connections feel overly symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and symbolism (fan as memory, lines as fate) evokes thought and lingering impact; ending is purposeful, yet emotional resonance is undercut by stated rather than shown feelings; central conflict is clear but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style through evocative metaphors, but some phrases feel ornate and verge on purple prose; originality is present in concept, yet emotional handling lacks nuance, relying on explicit descriptors over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question of duty and oblivion; style occasionally hinders clarity with dense imagery, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
