<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with the deputy's impassivity shaping his methodical actions, but motivation feels underdevelopedâ€”seeking "pure grace" lacks depth without stronger backstory or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the connection between oil changes and echoes is intriguing yet underdeveloped, leaving cause-effect links tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and supporting the tone of cautious bravery; however, the timeframe of oil changes feels slightly discordant with the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Storytelling craft is strong with layered symbolism (orchard as growth in decay) and a lingering emotional impact in the deputy's quiet recognition, but the central conflict remains subtle to a fault, lacking sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique setting and bee language concept, with fresh metaphors, but the deputy's emotional arc feels somewhat predictable, and sensory details occasionally verge on ornate, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows cohesive integration of elements and creative thinking, leaving a lingering question about listening to broken things, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped motivation hinder its readiness for top-tier publication.</comment>
