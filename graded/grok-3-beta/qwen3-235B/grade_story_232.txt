<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The physicianâ€™s exhaustion and obsession with unfinished tales are evident, but his personality lacks depth beyond generic torment; motivation is clear but not uniquely tied to his role as a physician.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution, driven by the scramble to the temple, though pacing feels rushed at critical moments, sacrificing emotional weight for action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The digital nomad camp and temple setting are vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the eerie tone of dire enchantment, though the connection between camp and ancient ruins feels slightly strained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (coffee grounds as prophecy, cutlass as seal) add layers, but emotional impact is muted by overwrought prose; the ending resolves tension but lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like coffee constellations are fresh, the story leans on familiar tropes of cursed relics and lost colleagues without subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like coffee patterns, but the style occasionally veers into opacity, overshadowing clarity; it leaves a faint lingering question but not profound depth.</comment>
