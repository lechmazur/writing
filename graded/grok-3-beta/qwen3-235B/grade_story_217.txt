<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the phone call and haunted house journey driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links, like the brother’s predicament, lack clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park and house are vividly realized with sensory details like burnt kimchi and sesame oil, enhancing the ephemeral gloom, though the setting’s connection to character motivation occasionally feels symbolic rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant mix of loss and wonder through imagery and food-related symbolism, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict’s resolution feels slightly abrupt, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of culinary memory and horror, some metaphors (e.g., rot birthing mushrooms) verge on cliché, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like food and adaptation, leaving a lingering bittersweetness, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
