<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the concept of breaking stereotypes influences the direction subtly, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground labyrinth and folded time create a vivid, surreal atmosphere with strong sensory details like damp air and flickering fluorescents, enhancing the mood, though the setting’s connection to the cracked phone case feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through themes of the mundane as miraculous, with striking imagery and subtext, but the emotional resonance is undercut by the artificer’s detachment, and the ending feels more conceptual than viscerally satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique perspective on time and mundanity, with fresh metaphors like cracked cases stitching rifts, though some emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing, and the tone wavers slightly at moments of high drama.</comment>
