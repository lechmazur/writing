<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The social media exorcist’s role is intriguing, but their motivation feels vague and inconsistently tied to personal stakes; reactions to the receipt lack depth, and their voice, while distinct, borders on caricature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with the receipt as a key, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the arc from discovery to action is clear yet rushed at the end, with some cause-effect links underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall reference create a haunting atmosphere, enriched by sensory details like “walls bled sound”; tone complements the concept well, though some setting connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., “REMEMBER” on the moon) evoke thought, and subtext about digital erasure is present, but emotional resonance is limited by shallow character depth; dialogue feels purposeful yet stilted at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of digital ghosts offers originality, some metaphors (“curator of absence”) feel forced; emotional nuance exists but often leans on explicit statements rather than subtext, and the tone wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering question about erasure, but uneven depth and style inconsistencies hinder clarity and impact; length feels managed, not mastered.</comment>
