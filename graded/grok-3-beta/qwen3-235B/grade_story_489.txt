<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but its personality and "aggressively kind" attribute feel underdeveloped, lacking depth in how this trait shapes specific actions beyond the whistle's use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, and the whale's call drives the narrative forward effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the dancer and lighthouse could be more logically grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly realized with strong sensory details like salt-stung creaks and fog, enhancing the atmosphere of loss and legacy; however, the dancer's stage setting feels underdeveloped by comparison.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the dancer's ancestral connection and uses powerful imagery (e.g., whale's call, tectonic memory), but the ending feels slightly unresolved, and the central conflict lacks sharp definition within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique ghostly perspective and fresh metaphors like "tectonic memory," some descriptions (e.g., "brazen calm") feel overly ornate, and emotional resonance relies more on stated impact than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the whistle and lighthouse, and it leaves a lingering thought about loss and legacy; however, the style occasionally hinders clarity with dense phrasing.</comment>
