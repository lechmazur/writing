<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a penitent memory thief is clear, with regret driving her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond remorse, and her voice feels indistinct despite the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness within the word limit, with recalibrating the crack driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with sensory details like “icy warmth” and “overripe mangoes,” enhancing the setting’s mood, though the swing set’s timeframe integration feels peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., toy block as memory vessel) evoke emotion and subtext, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict’s resolution feels slightly underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in combining memory theft with fruit preservation, but metaphors like “burned like a coal” feel overused, and emotional nuance is present yet occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of penance, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity at times.</comment>
