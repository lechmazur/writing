<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edric's cold nature and lawful rebelliousness are evident in his pragmatic adherence to orders, but his emotional shift triggered by the mitten feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in backstory or internal conflict to fully ground his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the artistic awakening driving a shift, but the ledger as a decoy feels abrupt and underexplored, disrupting coherence and leaving the pacing uneven at critical turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The deserted intersection at night sets a haunting tone that complements the folk remedy concept, with evocative sensory details like pine resin enhancing atmosphere, though the secret agent center feels disconnected from the altars' mysticism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (mitten as heart, altars as scars) evoke emotion and subtext about grief and repair, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and the central conflict feels more implied than sharply defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the artistic awakening offers a fresh lens, some metaphors (e.g., "canvas heâ€™d never known") border on generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies despite unique elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but overly ornate language occasionally obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength, limiting depth.</comment>
