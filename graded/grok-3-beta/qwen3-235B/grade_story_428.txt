<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear—escaping complicity and self-imposed chains—but lacks depth in emotional nuance; the prepper's internal conflict feels stated rather than shown through distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the tunnel revelation; logical flow is maintained, though cause and effect between actions and outcomes could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the ancient Indian temple is vividly rendered and enhances the atmosphere of decay and mystery; sensory details like the groaning pillars and gold veins are evocative, though some connections to character motivation feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (broken constellations, ink blotter) adds layers of meaning, but emotional impact is uneven due to reliance on telling over showing; ending is purposeful but not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate phrasing borders on purple prose; emotional handling lacks nuance at times, leaning on explicit statements over subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought of survival and ruin, though overall clarity is sometimes hindered by dense language.</comment>
