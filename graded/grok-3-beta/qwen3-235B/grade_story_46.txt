<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's blank face is intriguing but lacks deeper emotional resonance or backstory; motivation to guard rumors feels imposed rather than organic, and their voice remains indistinct despite the evocative role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains a clear arc with the rumor's approval as a climax, though pacing feels slightly rushed; connections between moon paths and action are logical but underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting of the orchard with waterfalls is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the eerie tone and supporting the concept of rumors; atmosphere strongly complements the performer's madness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through rich imagery and subtext of guardianship; ending is satisfying, and central tension of approving rumors is well-handled, though emotional depth could be shown more than told.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in its surreal approach, but some metaphors (e.g., "shattered glass") feel slightly overused; style is distinct yet occasionally verges on purple prose, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration; style supports the surreal tone but occasionally hinders accessibility; leaves a lingering mood, though not a profound question.</comment>
