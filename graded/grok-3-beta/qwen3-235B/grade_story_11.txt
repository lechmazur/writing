<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear—avenging her brother and leaving a legacy—but the "flighty" attribute feels underexplored, used more as a label than a driver of personality or action. Her voice lacks distinctiveness despite the emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning (grief), middle (subversion), and end (legacy), but pacing feels rushed at the climax. The "flicker of unity" concept drives tension, though cause-effect links in her map's impact on the society are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret society hall is vividly rendered with frescoes and incense, enhancing the mystical atmosphere and supporting the character’s subversive intent. Sensory details are strong, though the timeframe’s integration feels vague and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes anger and loss effectively through imagery (grease, maps, flame), with layers of subtext about legacy and labor. However, the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central conflict’s resolution lacks full emotional payoff within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors (scar tissue, blood in blueprint), but some phrases ("flighty no longer") feel clichéd. Emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking surface-level impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the patch and maps, leaving a lingering question about legacy. However, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
