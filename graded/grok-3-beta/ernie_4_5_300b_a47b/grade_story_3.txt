<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kellis’s surliness is implied but not deeply explored, limiting the depth of his personality; his motivation to understand cosmic patterns is clear but feels somewhat abstract and underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the riddle as a pivotal action, but the resolution feels slightly rushed and the connection to market wisdom is tenuous, disrupting coherence within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sailor’s graveyard and timeframe between seasons are evocatively rendered with strong sensory details like “salt-stained stones” and “dead kelp,” enhancing the atmosphere of dignified chaos, though the setting’s link to market wisdom feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story employs effective imagery and symbolism with the yarn and sea, evoking thought on chaos and order, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper character nuance; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on cosmic patterns through yarn and riddles, it occasionally leans on familiar ghostly tropes without subversion, and some metaphors like “infinite loom” feel slightly overused rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like yarn and the graveyard, but the integration of market wisdom feels unnatural, and the style, while evocative, occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
