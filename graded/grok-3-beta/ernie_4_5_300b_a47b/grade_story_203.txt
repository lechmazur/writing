<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exorcist’s stage fright is a compelling internal conflict, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the weight of inherited lies is stated rather than deeply felt through nuanced actions or dialogue. Her distinct voice emerges in moments of defiance, yet overall emotional depth is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the ritual as a climax, but pacing feels uneven—key emotional beats are rushed while symbolic actions linger too long. The connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a fully satisfying resolution; cause and effect are logical yet not always impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocative and ties metaphorically to shattered dreams, enhancing the atmosphere. However, sensory details are sparse beyond visual imagery, missing opportunities for deeper immersion. The tone of defiant hush aligns with the setting but isn’t consistently supported by mood-building details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its themes of inheritance and reinvention, with strong use of symbolism (toys, flowers). The ending feels purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat muted by overreliance on telling over showing. Dialogue is minimal and functional, lacking depth. A clear conflict exists, though its resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story offers a unique blend of exorcism and sci-fi, avoiding overt clichés, though the “inherited lies” trope isn’t fully subverted. Metaphors like debris as rebirth are fresh, but some language (e.g., “constellation of rebirth”) verges on purple prose. Emotional handling shows nuance in places but occasionally states feelings outright. Overall style is distinct, though not entirely polished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, and the brief length feels intentional, not limiting. Creative thinking is evident in combining exorcism with orbital debris, but style sometimes obscures clarity with ornate phrasing. It leaves a lingering thought about breaking free from legacy, though not powerfully so.</comment>
