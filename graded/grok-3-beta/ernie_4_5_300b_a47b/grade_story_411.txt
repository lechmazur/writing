<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Veyraâ€™s portrayal as a sentient car mechanic is intriguing, but her motivation to hear unsaid confessions feels underexplored and slightly disconnected from her mechanical nature; her distinct voice is present but inconsistent in depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with gathering fragments driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between starlight and mirror reconstruction are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean orchard and river of stars create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that complements the tone of exultant grief; sensory details are evocative, though some connections between setting and character motivation remain tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through imagery and theme of unspoken truths, but overreliance on abstract language dulls impact; the ending is poignant yet lacks a fully satisfying resolution of central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is original with striking imagery, some metaphors feel overwrought and generic; emotional nuance exists but occasionally slips into stated feelings rather than shown depth, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of infinity and loss, but overly ornate style hinders clarity, and the brief length feels somewhat restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
