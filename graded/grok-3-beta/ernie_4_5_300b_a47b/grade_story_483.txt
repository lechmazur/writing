<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and metaphor, but reliance on tropes like the “weary sheriff” and “chaotic freedom” feels predictable; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with elements, but style lacks polish; brief length feels like a constraint, not a choice, and depth is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>
