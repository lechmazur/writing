<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's insomnia and poetic nature are hinted at, but his motivations lack depth and consistency; his reactions to the botanical samples feel more performative than revealing of inner conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "eliminate" feels forced into the narrative, and pacing suffers from rushed dialogue and an abrupt ending lacking resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting is vividly described with sensory details like whiskey and decay, enhancing the mood, but the connection to "between subway stops" feels tangential and underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, like nightshade’s “tiny fists,” the narrative leans on predictable eccentric-poet tropes, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like botanical samples, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
