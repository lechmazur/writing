<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the alchemist's quest to recover faith and connection to a lost apprentice, but the personality lacks distinct depth beyond the theoretical intuition, and the voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the stone-throwing action driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the resolution lacks full coherence with the spiral's ambiguous meaning.</comment>
