<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elric’s uptight nature and uncertainty are well-portrayed through his meticulous actions, but his emotional shift feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict to fully ground the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the emotional climax, and the action of analyzing adhesive doesn’t fully drive the narrative tension forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse and gravestone setting creates a striking, evocative atmosphere with sensory details like the wind’s bellowing, effectively supporting the tone of buried optimism, though the timeframe integration feels slightly vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Elric’s transformation and uses strong symbolism with the bulb, but the dialogue is minimal and the central conflict feels understated for the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on transformation, some metaphors (e.g., “arms of steel”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated insights than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
