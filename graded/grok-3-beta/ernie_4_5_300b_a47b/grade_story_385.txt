<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clara’s portrayal as a pleasant meddler is somewhat effective, with her manipulative charm driving actions, but her motivation to decode symbols feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond surface curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between decoding symbols and the action of weakening resolve feels forced, with pacing rushed at the climax, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital ward setting create a striking atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the beach setting feels disconnected from the hospital, weakening immersion.</comment>
