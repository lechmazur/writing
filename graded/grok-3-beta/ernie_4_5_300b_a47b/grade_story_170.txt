<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lila’s free-spirited and academically artistic nature is evident in her tactile approach to coral and sketching, but her motivation to hush shame feels underdeveloped, lacking deeper insight into her past failures beyond surface mentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from doubt to resilience is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the attic discovery, and the connection between memorizing coral names and overcoming shame lacks logical depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coral restoration station is vividly realized with sensory details like salt-crusted wings and tidal pools, enhancing the atmosphere of longing and doubt, though the timeframe’s significance feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (sewing as mending shame) evoke emotional resonance, and the ending is purposeful, but the central conflict of doubt feels more stated than shown through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like “salt-crusted wings” are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable themes of self-doubt and redemption without subversion, and emotional depth sometimes relies on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the sewing kit and coral, leaving a lingering sense of resilience, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity and emotional impact.</comment>
