<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve the colony is clear, but her "rationally rebellious" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes her personality beyond surface actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the festival as a climax, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between rebellion and council's decision are weak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chalk cliff artist colony setting is vivid and complements the tone of cheerful gloom effectively; sensory details like church bells enhance mood, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the theme of imperfect love, but dialogue feels stilted, and subtext is underdeveloped; showing vs. telling is inconsistent with overt statements of emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "brooch burned against her chest" are generic; emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating feelings directly rather than showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with forced poeticism; it leaves a mild lingering thought, though not deeply impactful.</comment>
