<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaricâ€™s nervousness is evident, but his depth feels underdeveloped; motivation to escape is clear but lacks nuanced backstory or emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete within constraints, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connection between photograph and escape is logical yet underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative elements, but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
