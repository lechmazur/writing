<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lysander’s characterization as a chess grandmaster is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and inconsistent at times; the xenophobia seems forced rather than integral to his personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot maintains a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven, with rushed transitions in the tunnel reveal; cause and effect are logical, though the mystery’s resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hydroponic noodle farm setting is vividly described with strong sensory details (cobalt glow, synthetic moss), enhancing atmosphere; however, the leaf-blowing timeframe feels disconnected from the indoor environment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally obscures clarity with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though depth feels constrained by surface-level exploration.</comment>
