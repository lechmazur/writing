<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thaddeus’s characterization as an old-fashioned mage is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and inconsistent at times, lacking depth in how his aimlessness drives specific actions beyond vague existential dread.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the mirror encounters driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution of the riddle lacks a fully satisfying causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse setting is vividly realized with sensory details and complements the tone of sanctified dread, though the playground timeframe feels jarringly disconnected and underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its themes of surrender and illusion, with strong symbolism in mirrors, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mirror reflections offers originality, some imagery (e.g., aurora as "celestial sigh") borders on cliché, and emotional resonance lacks nuance, occasionally feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of mirrors and dread, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
