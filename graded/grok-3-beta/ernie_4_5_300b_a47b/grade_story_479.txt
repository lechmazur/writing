<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlowe Voss’s glamorous undertaker persona is intriguing, and her motivation to preserve stories of the deceased aligns with her role, but her character lacks depth beyond the surface eccentricity; her voice, though distinct, feels more stylistic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a semblance of completeness within the word limit, with elongating coffins driving a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between Eleanor’s story and Marlowe’s actions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is evocatively paired with the timeframe of paint mixing, creating a unique atmosphere, and sensory details like paint viscosity stand out, though the city skyline feels tacked on and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on loneliness and legacy through strong imagery and subtext, but the emotional impact is diluted by overly ornate prose at times; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant due to rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of debunking ordinariness is original, some metaphors (e.g., “serpent of memory”) feel generic, and the tone shifts slightly with abrupt emotional descriptors; it shows individual style but borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the brass tape, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with overwrought language; it leaves a lingering thought on preservation, though depth is constrained by length.</comment>
