<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Corvin's "fiercely nonchalant" attribute shapes his personality somewhat, but his motivations feel underdeveloped and lack depth beyond a quirky obsession with chaos; his voice is distinct yet repetitive in tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot progression feels uneven within the word limit, with an intriguing premise but rushed resolution; the tinderbox drives the narrative, yet cause-effect links between chaos and action are vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Steampunk airship setting is evocative with sensory details like oil and gears, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection between setting and tinderbox feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story shows flashes of impact with metaphors like "kiss the horizon of madness," but emotional resonance is shallow; dialogue is purposeful but not always natural, and the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the story leans on steampunk tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks polish, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
