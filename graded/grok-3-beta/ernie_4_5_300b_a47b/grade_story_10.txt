<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s portrayal as a cheerless duelist is evident, and his motivation to learn forgiveness ties to his family curse, but his personality lacks depth beyond stoicism, and reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of elasticizing the curse driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between mutations and forgiveness are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport customs office is vividly described with sensory details like rust and server hums, enhancing the bittersweet tone, though the setting’s connection to forgiveness feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with themes of letting go, supported by symbolism of the chest and stew, but the ending lacks punch, and subtext is present yet not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mutated recipes is original, some metaphors (e.g., “ghosts of transactions”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
