<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theo’s motivation to correct past regrets through fireworks design is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped; the “theoretically creative” attribute lacks depth in action or voice beyond surface creativity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a logical connection from frost patterns to the final display, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hidden library behind a waterfall is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the ephemeral tone and Theo’s motivation, though the setting’s connection to the pressed leaves feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of acceptance, with strong imagery like frost and fireworks, but the ending feels predictable, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks naturalness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like frost patterns and leaves are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like frost and leaves, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
