<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finn's spirited nature and awkward grace are evident in his actions and dialogue, but his motivation to learn healing traditions feels underexplored, lacking depth in personal stakes beyond the letter's influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the coded letter driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the confrontation with Madame Veyra, and the resolution lacks clarity, leaving the story's end somewhat abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like clinking crystal and bone-like atmosphere, enhancing the eerie tone, though the bike rides as a timeframe feel less integrated into the central mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes unease through Finn’s nightmares and the letter’s mystery, with strong imagery like “ash-choked skies,” but dialogue feels occasionally stilted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise of a future war letter and ossuary restaurant offers originality, some metaphors like “blade wrapped in velvet” feel overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the lingering question of Finn’s choice is intriguing, but stylistic choices sometimes obscure clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
