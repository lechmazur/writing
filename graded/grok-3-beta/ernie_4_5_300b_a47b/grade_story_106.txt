<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elias’s sullenness is present but not distinctly voiced, and his shift in motivation feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between stamps, quilt, and station activation feels contrived and disrupts logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater power station setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the mournful atmosphere, though its connection to the quilt feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is moderate; metaphors like the quilt as valor are fresh, but reliance on a “magical object” trope and some generic descriptors lessen authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is fair, with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
