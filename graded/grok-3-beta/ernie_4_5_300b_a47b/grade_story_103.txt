<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Sir Alaric’s motivations are hinted at through memories and duty, but his internal conflict lacks depth due to limited exploration of his past. His voice feels somewhat generic for a knight archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, and the impossible choice drives the narrative effectively. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks clarity in cause-and-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and storm atmosphere are vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the mood of regret and tension. However, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the father-daughter memory and final choice, with decent use of symbolism (hourglass, lantern). Yet, the impact is diluted by a lack of nuanced subtext and a somewhat predictable resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on familiar knightly duty tropes without significant subversion. Imagery like the crab knocker is fresh, but emotional depth feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, and the brevity feels somewhat deliberate. However, it lacks a truly lingering thought or question, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
