<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alaric's grumpiness is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to quell inner unrest is clear, though his emotional transformation feels slightly abrupt given the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the sand mandala's role in driving the plot is intriguing yet underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The witch’s crystal scrying room is vividly rendered with sensory details like gravel crunching and stained glass, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and trauma feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Alaric’s grief and uses symbolism (mandala as psyche), but the ending, while poignant, lacks a fully earned impact due to limited buildup; dialogue is minimal but effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the narrative offers a unique take on trauma, some metaphors (e.g., trauma as tapestry) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies partly on stating feelings rather than fully showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering reflection on trauma, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
