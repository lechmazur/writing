<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marla’s vigilance and orchardist background shape her meticulous nature, but her transition to a conspiracy theorist feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuance in motivation beyond her daughter’s disappearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot’s conspiracy arc is intriguing but feels rushed within the word limit, with connections between paper airplane patterns and real-world implications not fully fleshed out; pacing is uneven, with a hurried resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is an unusual setting that supports the plot, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance Marla’s emotional stakes or the conspiracy’s tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its conspiracy theme and peacock symbolism, but the emotional impact is muted due to limited ‘showing’ of Marla’s grief; the ending is satisfying yet lacks profound resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of paper airplane conspiracies is original, some metaphors (e.g., peacock’s tail) feel forced and repetitive; emotional depth is stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though creative execution is hampered by uneven depth and style.</comment>
