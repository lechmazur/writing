<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reeve's recklessness and meticulous carelessness are evident in his approach to mapping ghost towns, but his internal conflict and growth feel underexplored within the word limit; Marla’s role as a catalyst lacks depth in her own motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from obsession to vulnerability is clear but feels rushed at the resolution; atomizing as an action drives the story conceptually but lacks concrete progression in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The misty forest and abandoned funfair create a haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details like fog and saxophone wails, effectively supporting the tone of bold vulnerability; however, some connections between setting and character motivation feel implied rather than explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on vulnerability and past regrets with strong imagery (e.g., ghosts clawing through fog), but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional over-telling; dialogue feels purposeful yet slightly stilted in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on ghost towns as personal hauntings, some metaphors (e.g., shattered glass laughter) verge on cliché; emotional nuance is present but inconsistent, with moments of stated feelings rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering thought on vulnerability, though not with exceptional depth.</comment>
