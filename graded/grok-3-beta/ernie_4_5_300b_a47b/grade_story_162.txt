Elias’s trustworthiness is stated rather than shown through nuanced actions. Motivations are clear but not richly explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the blueprint driving tension, and the resolution feels earned.

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of hidden blueprints and unlikely partnerships without fresh subversion.
