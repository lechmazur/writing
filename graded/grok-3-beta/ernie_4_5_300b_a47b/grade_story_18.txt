<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Veyra’s telepathy shapes her isolation and quest for truth, and her motivation is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the tragically joyful attribute; her reaction to the hair tie feels symbolic yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action of weatherizing drives the plot, and the calligraphy method fits conceptually, but the arc feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution and lingering questions about impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the gloomy tone and Veyra’s motivation; however, the connection between setting and hair tie feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the theme of loneliness versus truth, supported by decent imagery; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and dialogue is sparse but natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is unique, some metaphors (e.g., “star through clouds”) feel generic; emotional handling is more shown than told but lacks deeper nuance; overall style is distinct yet not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like calligraphy and telepathy, but it doesn’t fully transcend the constraints of its length or leave a profound lingering impact; style supports clarity but isn’t exceptional.</comment>
