<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Everard’s submissive nature is well-portrayed through his demeanor and actions, but his sudden shift to bravery feels slightly unconvincing given the depth of his established timidity; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the resolution feels rushed and the connection between eavesdropping and the creature’s stabilization is tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret agent workshop setting is intriguing and contrasts well with the garden, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully amplify the story’s emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild empathy through Everard’s actions, but the ending lacks punch; dialogue is purposeful yet stiff, and deeper subtext or thematic resonance is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of a meek hero rising to the occasion without enough subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it lacks a lingering impact or profound depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
