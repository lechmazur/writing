<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear and drives her actions, but her personality as an "eager lookout" feels underdeveloped, lacking distinct voice or depth beyond her obsession with the supernatural.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between poltergeist activity and the sewing box's role in resolution is somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Roman villa reimagined as a modern space is evocative, with sensory details like gleaming marble and clicking tiles enhancing atmosphere, though the tone of "ruthless kindness" sometimes clashes with the ghostly melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through Lila's longing for connection, with effective symbolism in the sewing box, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and dialogue with the ghost lacks natural impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on ghostly interaction via small acts of mending, some metaphors (e.g., "clinging like lichen") feel generic, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive narrative with creative integration of elements like the sewing box and villa, but overly ornate language at times hinders clarity, and the lingering impact feels moderate rather than profound.</comment>
