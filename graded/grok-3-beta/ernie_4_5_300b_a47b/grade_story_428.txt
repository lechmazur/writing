<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to banish doubt is clear, but the city planner’s transition to doomsday prepper feels underdeveloped; lacks depth in how “rarely authentic” shapes actions beyond surface mentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the method of studying broken constellations drives the story yet lacks logical grounding within the narrative framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ancient Indian temple setting is evocative with sensory details like sandalwood scent; atmosphere supports the tone of daring caution effectively, though connection to object feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on doubt as a chain through strong symbolism of the blotter; ending is satisfying, but dialogue is sparse and subtext, while present, lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors (blotter as star chart) are fresh, but others (walls humming with hymns) verge on cliché; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, limiting authenticity and originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the blotter and temple, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity; leaves a lingering thought on doubt, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
