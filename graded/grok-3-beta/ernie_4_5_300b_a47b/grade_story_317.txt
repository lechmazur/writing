<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zeta-7's nostalgic and anxiously fearless traits are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to prevent collapse feels mechanical rather than deeply personal, lacking emotional depth despite a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with crystal growth driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between betrayal and crystals are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The levitation facility at dawn creates a striking atmosphere, with vivid sensory details like glowing corridors and pulsing crystals; however, the setting’s connection to betrayal feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on betrayal and resolve, with some effective imagery, but the central conflict resolves too neatly, and subtext about human patterns lacks depth or emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a caretaker android is intriguing, the narrative leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors like “frozen ocean” feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or profound depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
