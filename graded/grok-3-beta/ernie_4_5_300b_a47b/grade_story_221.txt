<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation to step out of her father’s shadow is clear, and her interaction with the amber reveals a nuanced emotional depth, but her wreck-diver and ghost-whisperer traits feel underexplored, lacking impact on her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of shooting at the gallery drives the emotional climax, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between the letter and the carnival visit is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like “cotton candy and gunpowder,” enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting Lila’s motivation, though the timeframe of the half-written letter feels less integrated into the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lila’s reconciliation with grief and memory, with strong symbolism in the amber and shooting gallery, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of tradition as a bridge, while present, lacks deeper subtext or layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a personal take on grief, some metaphors like “thawing heart” feel overused, and the emotional resonance, though present, relies at times on stated feelings rather than fully showing nuanced reactions; the style is distinct but not wholly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the amber and carnival, leaving a lingering emotional impact, but the integration of all assigned elements isn’t seamless, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
