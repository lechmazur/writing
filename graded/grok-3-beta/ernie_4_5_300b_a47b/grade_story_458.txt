<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Elara’s motivation to preserve tradition clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits; her voice in dialogue feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between coffee stain divination and plot resolution is strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly described with evocative details, enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting the theme of fading traditions; atmosphere aligns well with motivation.</comment>
