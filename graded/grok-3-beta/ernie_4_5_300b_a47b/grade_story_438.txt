<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleanor Voss’s characterization as a vague mystic is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivations are clear but lack depth, and her flamboyance feels more decorative than essential to her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the action of overriding driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthetic biology lab setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the hum of centrifuges, enhancing the atmosphere of hollow recklessness, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
