<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth architect’s motivation to save the maze is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the crisis; her reactions feel driven by plot necessity rather than distinct traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the collapse’s stakes aren’t fully developed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of desperate hope, with strong sensory details like flickering emergency lights, though some atmospheric elements feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through the theme of connection, with decent use of symbolism (labyrinth as bonds), but the ending lacks punch, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of sacred geometry offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., flight paths as starlight) feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like calling cards, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
