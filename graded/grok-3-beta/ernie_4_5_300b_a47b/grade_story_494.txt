<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s arrogance and doubtfully confident nature are evident in his tone and actions, but his transformation feels slightly rushed; deeper internal conflict or nuance in dialogue could elevate his distinct voice and motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from conflict to resolution via the song is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—initial tension is strong, yet the climax (singing) lacks buildup; logical flow is maintained, though the action of ‘authorize’ feels forced into the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard is vividly rendered with sensory details like damp tiles and trembling blossoms, enhancing the harsh tenderness tone; however, the setting’s connection to the tapestry and timeframe (‘between breaths’) feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kael’s reluctant song and the tapestry’s restoration, with strong imagery and symbolism; yet, dialogue occasionally feels stilted, and the theme of harmony over strength, while present, lacks deeper subtext or reflection beyond the surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on shackled potential via song, some metaphors (e.g., blade gleaming like spite) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative style lacks a fully distinct voice, hovering near formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the song and tapestry, leaving a lingering sense of potential; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity sometimes limits depth, making it feel more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
