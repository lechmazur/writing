<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of dividing driving the narrative, but the method (gossip columns) feels forced and disrupts coherence; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned space station medical bay is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of loneliness, with sensory details like the universe’s hum adding immersion; however, the setting’s connection to the dried flowers feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Jessa’s journey, with some effective symbolism in the dividing petals, but the theme of redemption feels surface-level; dialogue is minimal and lacks impact, and the ending is only moderately satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story shows some originality in blending sci-fi with personal redemption, it leans on predictable tropes of cursed oaths and solitary journeys without subversion; metaphors like the universe’s song are overused, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
