<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to embody values is clear, but the groggy brewer's personality feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the mirror shard beyond generic restlessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the mirror shard encounter driving a shift, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between protest and mansion exploration lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively eerie with strong sensory details like "wet earth and iron," enhancing the haunted mansion setting, though the protest's integration into the mood feels slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some reflection on individuality versus apathy through symbolism of the mirror, but the ending lacks punch, and dialogue is minimal with limited impact; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in linking brewing to personal values, but reliance on haunted mansion tropes without subversion and generic descriptors like "spilled ink" dull the uniqueness; emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with a lingering thought on uniqueness, but integration of elements like the protest lull feels forced; style is clear but lacks the polish for top-tier impact within the length constraint.</comment>
