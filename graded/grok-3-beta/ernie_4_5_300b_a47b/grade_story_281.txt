<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Finn’s motivation to challenge the status quo emerges late and feels somewhat forced, lacking depth in his initial characterization as a baffled pickpocket; his shift to poet feels abrupt despite distinct dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the transformation concept driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the end—and the impromptu poetry method introduces minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly described with strong sensory details (steam, foghorn), enhancing the eerie tone and supporting the transformation concept, though the timeframe integration feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on transformation and has memorable imagery (steam forming shapes), with a satisfying ending, but dialogue occasionally feels stilted and the theme lacks deeper subtext beyond surface rebellion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the poetry method offers some originality, the thief-to-rebel trope feels predictable without subversion; metaphors are fresh but emotions are often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with some creative integration (poetry as transformation), leaving a lingering idea of self-redefinition, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped depth prevent a higher score.</comment>
