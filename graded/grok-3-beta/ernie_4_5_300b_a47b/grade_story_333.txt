<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s rebellious nature is clear, but her sincerity feels underdeveloped; motivation to preserve tradition lacks depth and specificity in her actions, making her voice somewhat indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; theorizing as an action drives the story minimally, and the resolution feels rushed with weak cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted passage and timeframe between storms create a vivid atmosphere, with strong sensory details like damp brick and old wood scent; however, the setting’s connection to character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (e.g., sticky note as compass) are effective, and the theme of change emerges, but emotional impact is muted; dialogue is purposeful but not always natural, and subtext lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of haunted spaces without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the style lacks distinct individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
