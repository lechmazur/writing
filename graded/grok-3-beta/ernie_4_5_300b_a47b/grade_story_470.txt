<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of accepting guardianship driving the narrative.

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine library is vividly realized with sensory details like oil and parchment, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery.

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Lirael’s longing, and the imagery of gears and metal whispers is effective.
