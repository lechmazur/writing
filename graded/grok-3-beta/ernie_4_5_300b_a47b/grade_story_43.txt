<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s wariness and introversion shape her skeptical view of courage, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper insight into her past beyond her brother’s disappearance. Her distinct voice is present, though inconsistently nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and end, but the meandering action feels somewhat repetitive and lacks urgency. Pacing is managed decently within the word limit, though coherence wavers with abrupt shifts in focus between internal reflection and external action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The neon cathedral setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of crooked hope. However, the timeframe of “after the last human story” feels underexplored, missing a stronger connection to the setting’s desolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Lira’s journey, with effective imagery and symbolism (fireflies, neon veins). However, the theme of courage feels somewhat heavy-handed, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly surprising or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story shows some originality in its setting and concept, it occasionally leans on predictable tropes about courage and loss without fully subverting them. Metaphors like “dance with fear” are fresh but not consistently unique, and emotional depth is sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the fireflies and CD, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity. The brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, though it leaves a faint lingering thought about courage.</comment>
