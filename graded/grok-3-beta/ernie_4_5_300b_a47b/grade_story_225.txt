<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira Vey’s motivation to track migratory butterflies is clear and aligns with her wayward, moral-driven nature as an apothecary, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular obsession; her voice, while distinct in conviction, feels underdeveloped in dialogue and inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of infecting larvae driving the story forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; logical flow is maintained, though the depth charge incident feels abrupt and underexplored as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like rusted gears and salt-streaked portholes, enhancing the battered marvel tone; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motivation, and the timeframe of broken treaties feels underutilized in grounding the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lira’s connection to the butterflies and uses potent imagery like glowing wings, but the ending feels slightly sentimental rather than profoundly satisfying; subtext around love as infection is present but not fully layered; dialogue is sparse and lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining steampunk with bioluminescent tracking, but relies on familiar tropes of the misunderstood visionary without subversion; metaphors are fresh in places (love as wildfire), yet emotional resonance sometimes leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering sense of fragile hope; however, the brief length feels somewhat restrictive, and style occasionally veers into over-ornate language that muddles clarity rather than enhancing impact.</comment>
