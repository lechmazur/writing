<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zib’s jumpy nature is well-portrayed through physical tics and reactions, but motivation feels underdeveloped; unmasking the Sage lacks deep personal stakes, making actions seem somewhat detached from character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the unmasking action driving the story, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax with insufficient buildup to the Sage’s revelation as a virus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly realized with neon imagery and glitching details, enhancing the eerie tone and Zib’s paranoia, though sensory depth beyond sight and sound is limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story offers some thematic depth with “truth decays” and the Sage as a virus, but emotional impact is muted; it shows more than tells, yet the ending lacks a stronger punch or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the pixelated setting and necromancer concept are fresh, some metaphors (e.g., “dying stars”) feel generic; emotional portrayal shows nuance, but overall style doesn’t fully distinguish itself from genre norms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the fishhook and mural, but it doesn’t fully transcend its constraints; it leaves a faint impression rather than a profound lingering thought.</comment>
