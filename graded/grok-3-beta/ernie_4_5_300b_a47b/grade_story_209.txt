<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, tied to redemption and his mother’s memory, but Elias’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond nostalgia and grief; his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between action and resolution feels forced; pacing is uneven, with rushed conclusions about the railways’ significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the radio wave garden is evocative with strong sensory detail (static as ghosts), enhancing atmosphere, though the hospital monitor timeframe feels underexplored in the present action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through loss and redemption themes, with decent symbolism (hairbrush as antenna), but dialogue feels stilted and the ending lacks a fully satisfying impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like the hairbrush as antenna, but metaphors (despair as liar) are somewhat clichéd; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about hidden truths, though not powerfully so.</comment>
