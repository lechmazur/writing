<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation to make peace with his past is clear, but his “shaky” and “carefully reckless” traits feel inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how they shape his actions beyond surface-level trembling and risk-taking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the search for amber driving the narrative, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution via the amber’s magic is somewhat abrupt and convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artist haven is vividly realized with sensory details like shattered stained glass and paint-streaked faces, strongly supporting the tone of improbable longing; however, the timeframe’s “echoing hour” feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kael’s confrontation with his past, and the spider-amber symbolism is effective, but the dialogue is minimal and lacks punch, and the theme of forgiveness feels slightly underdeveloped due to the rushed ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with the amber and spider weaving memories, it leans on the trope of magical redemption without fully subverting it, and some descriptions (e.g., “fever dream”) feel slightly generic rather than innovative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing that hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling of bittersweet resolution, though not profoundly so.</comment>
