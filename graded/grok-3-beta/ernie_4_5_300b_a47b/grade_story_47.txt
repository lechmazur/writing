<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lilaâ€™s dutiful nature as a ward is evident, but her shift to rebellion feels abrupt and insufficiently motivated by her established traits; her voice is distinct but lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of solving via stolen voice notes feels forced into the narrative, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed climactic moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is vividly described with sensory details like silence and marble halls, enhancing atmosphere, but the connection between setting and the glove feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with rebellion against mortality, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; dialogue feels purposeful but not entirely natural; ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of reframing the familiar is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat predictable rebellion tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like the glove pulsing are overused and lack specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive edge; it leaves a mild impression without deep resonance.</comment>
