<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Jessa's streetwise nature shapes her actions and motivations effectively, particularly in her survival-driven decisions and sharp observations, but her internal transformation lacks deeper nuance, feeling slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc—beginning with curiosity, peaking at a moral dilemma, and resolving with a choice—while the concept of "reversed patterns" drives the narrative logically; however, pacing feels slightly uneven with rushed introspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lost orchard temple is vividly rendered with sensory details like overripe peaches and glittering gravel, enhancing the eerie, uncertain tone and complementing Jessa’s motivation; minor disconnect exists between timeframe and atmospheric grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through Jessa’s choice and uses potent symbolism (brooch as mirror, reversed patterns), with a satisfying ending; yet, emotional depth is somewhat surface-level, relying on stated rather than fully shown transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on a cursed object and personal growth, some metaphors (e.g., "harvest light") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance lacks subtle subtext, leaning toward predictable resolution patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the brooch and temple, leaving a lingering sense of choice; however, stylistic choices occasionally prioritize imagery over clarity, and brevity feels like a constraint in character depth.</comment>
