<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s dutiful nature as a sentinel shapes his protective stance toward Elara’s work, but his motivations feel somewhat underdeveloped; the shift to destructive action lacks deeper emotional grounding or nuance in his internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from wedding to dawn is clear within the word limit, and the action of destruction drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the reactor’s transformation lacks a fully logical cause-effect explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The photosynthesis lab setting enhances the concept of light and memory, with vivid sensory details like glowing panels and smog-choked skies, though the wedding atmosphere clashes tonally at times with the primal urgency of the mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes awe with the sunrise and uses strong symbolism (hair clip as rebellion), but dialogue feels stilted, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing; the theme of stories is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of algae storing sunrises is inventive, some metaphors (e.g., “thousand tiny suns”) feel overused, and emotional responses lack nuance, occasionally slipping into predictable patterns; still, the narrative shows a distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the lab and sunrise, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
