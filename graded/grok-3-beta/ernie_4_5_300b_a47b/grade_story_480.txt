<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jessa's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but her motivations feel surface-level, driven by vague curiosity rather than a deeply explored personal stake. Her voice is distinct in tone, but her reactions lack depth or nuanced development within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, moving from the music hall to the secret club, with the receipt as a guiding device. However, the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the resolution lacks a strong sense of closure or consequence, leaving the narrative somewhat incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid, with evocative details like the "hum of neon signs" and "linoleum floors, cracked and sticky." The abandoned settings enhance the eerie tone and mirror the concept of digital haunting, though sensory details could be more consistently layered to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has moments of impact with imagery like "burnt sugar and regret," but the emotional resonance is uneven. Dialogue feels purposeful but not always natural, and the central conflict is underdeveloped. Subtext exists, yet itâ€™s not fully realized, leaving the ending more ambiguous than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story shows originality in combining digital exorcism with secret clubs, avoiding overly formulaic tropes. However, some metaphors ("paint peeling like old skin") feel familiar, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown. The tone is consistent, but the style lacks a truly unique authorial stamp.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the receipt and familiar strangers, but it doesn't fully transcend the constraints of its length or premise. It leaves a lingering curiosity, yet lacks the depth or polish for top-tier publication without significant refinement.</comment>
