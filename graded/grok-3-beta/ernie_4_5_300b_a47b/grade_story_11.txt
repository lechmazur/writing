<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to leave a legacy is clear, but her “flighty” attribute feels underdeveloped and inconsistently portrayed; it doesn’t distinctly shape her actions or personality beyond a vague restlessness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with “linearizing” driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between discoveries and unity are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret society hall setting is evocative with glowing symbols, enhancing the mood, but sensory details are sparse beyond visual cues, limiting immersion; the “strangely normal” attribute feels underutilized in atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story has potential for emotional impact with unity as a theme, but relies too much on telling (e.g., “serene anger”) rather than showing through nuanced action; symbolism in paintings is promising but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of hidden details in paintings is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable secret society tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than evoked, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering depth or question, settling for a tidy resolution over profound impact.</comment>
