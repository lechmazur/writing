<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map the caves is clear, and the necromancer's hushed nature fits the tone, but Kael’s personality lacks depth; his actions and dialogue don’t reveal a distinct voice or nuanced layers beyond nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with mapping as the goal and a resolution in renewed purpose, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between necromancy and cave preservation isn’t logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly described with bioluminescent imagery and sensory detail, enhancing the futuristic nostalgic tone, though the setting’s connection to necromancy feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through nostalgia and resolve, with effective imagery of the cave and film, but the central conflict is understated, and subtext about loss isn’t fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a necromancer preserving echoes is original, some metaphors (e.g., “bridge between worlds”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements like the cave and nostalgia, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
