<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s fact-minded nature is clear, but her shift to empathy feels abrupt and insufficiently motivated, lacking depth in internal conflict. Her voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution. The connection between empathy and finding forgotten places is logical but underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unstable dimension and timeframe are evocatively described with strong imagery, enhancing the atmosphere. However, sensory details are uneven, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in key emotional moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through shared grief and uses effective metaphors like the compass as empathy. However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext is present but not deeply layered; dialogue is purposeful but not entirely natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of empathy as a map is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., “time curled like smoke”) feel slightly overused. Emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally leans toward overwritten prose, hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering thought about empathy, though not profoundly so.</comment>
