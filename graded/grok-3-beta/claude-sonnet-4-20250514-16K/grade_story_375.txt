<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to channel the star's wrath is intriguing but underdeveloped; her "smiling saboteur" persona lacks depth in action and voice, feeling more like a surface trait than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing is uneven, and the connection between studying and broadcasting feels rushed and lacks clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of decay and beauty; however, the timeframe of "studying" feels vague and underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative mood with some effective imagery (e.g., "symphony of imperfection"), but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the ending, while purposeful, doesn't fully resonate emotionally or thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining decay with cosmic wrath, and metaphors like "star's pulse" are fresh, but some descriptions (e.g., "beautiful imperfections") verge on clich√©, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering depth or question.</comment>
