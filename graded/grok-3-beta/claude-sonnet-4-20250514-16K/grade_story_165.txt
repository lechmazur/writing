<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mirin's portrayal as a gentle conjurer is evident in her careful handling of the butterfly and her quest for justice through restoration, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking distinctiveness beyond her mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the reassembling of the butterfly driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution, while poetic, lacks a fully grounded connection to the initial conflict within the tight word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground dwarven city is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like crystalline light and phantom scents, enhancing the atmosphere of joyful terror; however, the connection between the setting and the brittle branch breaking feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the garden's longing and Mirin's realization about justice, with strong imagery and symbolism in the butterfly's transformation; yet, the central conflict feels somewhat abstract, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a sharper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on justice as renewal, some descriptions (e.g., "joyful terror") feel slightly formulaic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing; metaphors like "trapped rainbows" are fresh but not consistently innovative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering thought about justice as preservation; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
