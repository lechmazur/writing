<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between elements is logical, yet the action's impact on the plot lacks deeper stakes or tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station setting is vividly described with evocative sensory details like the projector's hum, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the timeframe "between innings" feels underutilized and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
