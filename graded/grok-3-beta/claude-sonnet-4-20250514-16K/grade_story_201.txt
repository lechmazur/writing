<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between tracking shooting stars and the resolution is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the mood, though the connection between setting and emotional inheritance could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
