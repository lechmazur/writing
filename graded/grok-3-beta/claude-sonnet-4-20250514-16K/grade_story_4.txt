<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to map sacred spaces is clear, and her role as a DJ channeling ancient gods shapes her actions uniquely, but her personality lacks depth or distinct voice beyond her function in the plot. Her reactions and methods feel somewhat mechanical, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from beginning to end within the word limit, with the action of mapping sacred spaces driving the narrative. However, pacing feels slightly rushed toward the conclusion, and some cause-effect links, like the thread’s guidance, are more poetic than logical.</comment>

Sensory details are evocative, though some descriptions lean toward excess without grounding in character perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of wonder through imagery and has a satisfying ending, with subtle themes of devotion and discovery.
