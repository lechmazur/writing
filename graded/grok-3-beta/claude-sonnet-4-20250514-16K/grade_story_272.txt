<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's social awkwardness and cynicism are evident, shaping his solitary persistence, but his inner transformation lacks depth due to limited exploration of emotional nuance; motivation is clear but feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a satisfying discovery, but pacing feels unevenâ€”rushed at the climax; connections between decoding and broader implications are logical but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The diner setting during late shift enhances the lonely, obsessive mood, with strong sensory details like grease and coffee; however, the encrypted archive as a setting feels abstract and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and mild triumph, with effective symbolism in the whistle; yet, emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the theme of rediscovery feels somewhat predictable despite subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of musical encryption is original, but reliance on the 'hidden genius of ancestors' trope feels familiar; metaphors like "tree of regret" are slightly overused, and emotional depth lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the whistle, but the brief length feels constraining rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
