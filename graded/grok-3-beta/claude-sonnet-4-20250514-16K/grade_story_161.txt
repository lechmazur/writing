<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s vigilant nature and orchardist background are clear and drive his meticulous observation, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; motivation for revenge is stated rather than felt, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the conspiracy revelation lacks buildup, and causality between observation and action feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is intriguing but underutilized for atmosphere; sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to tone and character motivation feels more functional than evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and a satisfying ending, with some subtext about patterns and truth, but emotional impact is limited by telling over showing; dialogue is purposeful but not particularly distinctive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The conspiracy angle offers originality, and the peacock seal metaphor is fresh, but the narrative leans on predictable revenge tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it leaves a lingering idea of justice, though depth beyond the surface is minimal.</comment>
