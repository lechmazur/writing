<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s freelance background is intriguing and justifies her presence in the engine room, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped. Her motivation to preserve wisdom is clear, yet her emotional connection to the task lacks depth beyond surface-level determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with Mira’s mission to document the engine, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end. The connection between beginning and end is present, though the threat of the salvage crew is underexplored, leaving cause-and-effect relationships somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk airship engine room is vividly realized with sensory details like the dying steam valves and gaslight, enhancing the atmosphere of scattered harmony. However, the post-wedding timeframe feels underutilized, missing deeper integration into the mood or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the captain’s legacy, with effective symbolism in the amber ring. Yet, the central conflict with the salvage crew lacks tension, and the theme of preserved wisdom, while present, isn’t layered enough to prompt profound reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the amber ring and steampunk setting offer some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of preserving legacy without subversion. Sensory details are specific, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the style feels competent yet not strikingly individual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, creative integration of elements is uneven, and the lingering impact is present but not powerful enough for a top-tier publication.</comment>
