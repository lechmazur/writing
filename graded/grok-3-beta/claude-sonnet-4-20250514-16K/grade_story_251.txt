<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zara's ambivalence and "happily sad" nature are intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivations lack depth and clarity, making her actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc is incomplete, with an abstract resolution that feels rushed within the word limit; the action of defragmenting drives the story but lacks clear cause-and-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lunar mining colony setting is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Zara's motivation or the story's concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (marbles, puzzles) are effective, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, metaphors like "cosmic scoreboard" feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced; the tone shifts slightly, undermining consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style is occasionally overwrought, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
