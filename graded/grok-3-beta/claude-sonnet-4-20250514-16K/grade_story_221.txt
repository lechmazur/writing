<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to break free from ancestral expectations is clear and consistent, and her interaction with the amber reveals her inner conflict. However, her personality lacks a distinct voice, and her actions, while aligned with her motivation, feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear connection between beginning and end. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the integration of ghostly whispers as a plot driver occasionally lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery enhances the melancholic tone and supports Marina's isolation. Sensory details like moonlight through the broken roof are evocative, but the connection between setting and object (amber) could be more meaningfully developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Marina's thawing heart and uses symbolism (amber as trapped life) effectively. However, the ending feels slightly underwhelming, and the central conflict, while present, lacks sharper tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining wreck-diving with ghostly communication. Metaphors like the thawing heart are fresh but not consistently nuanced, and emotional resonance relies at times on stated feelings rather than shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is present but not profound enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
