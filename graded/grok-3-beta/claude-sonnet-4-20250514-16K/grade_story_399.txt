<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erasmus's grumpiness as a crypt caretaker is well-portrayed and motivates his isolation, but his transformation feels slightly rushed, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuanced dialogue to fully flesh out his voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with trauma as a core concept driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly uneven, with the resolution arriving too abruptly to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of grandiose subtlety, though the connection between setting and object could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through trauma's exploration and employs striking imagery like the sand mandala, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on trauma, some metaphors (e.g., "serpents in your chest") feel overused, and emotional depth occasionally relies on stating rather than showing, slightly diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone, though style occasionally verges on ornate, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a thoughtful impression but not a profound one.</comment>
