<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to embrace the unknown is clear and consistent, but her personality as a "fading caretaker" lacks depth beyond surface-level apathy; her voice, while distinct in dialogue, doesn't fully reveal nuanced layers through action or reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete with a beginning, middle, and end, driven by the act of gorging on forbidden knowledge, but pacing is uneven with rushed revelations; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions feel abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The caravan repair station and post-wave timeframe create a vivid, desolate backdrop that enhances the forbidden allure, supported by sensory details like the lavender scent; however, the atmosphere occasionally feels secondary to exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and tension through Miraâ€™s discovery, with effective symbolism in the lavender and strong subtext of sacrifice; yet, the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional resonance is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of forbidden knowledge offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "stardust in her palms") feel overused; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and the tone wavers slightly, though the perspective remains unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels intentional; however, clarity is occasionally hindered by dense exposition, and the lingering impact, while present, lacks profound depth.</comment>
