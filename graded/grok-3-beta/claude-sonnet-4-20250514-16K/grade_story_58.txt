<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a loyal scout is clear, but Marcus's internal conflict and personality lack depth and distinctiveness; his voice feels functional rather than unique, and reactions to the journal cover are somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional beats; the connection between broadcasting comedy and radicalizing listeners is intriguing but underdeveloped and not fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone of dread, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the journal cover feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has subtext about inner peace amidst chaos and uses symbolism with the moths effectively, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive flair, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
