<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miriam's stage fright is effectively integrated into her character as an exorcist, shaping her internal conflict, but her motivation feels somewhat underdeveloped and her voice, while distinct, lacks deeper nuance under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the exorcism driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect relationships are occasionally vague, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly realized and complements the tone of isolation, with sensory details like zero gravity enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and wildflowers feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Miriam's shift to authenticity, with decent use of symbolism, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict feels resolved too neatly for the depth implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a somewhat fresh take on inherited deception, some metaphors (e.g., debris as lies) feel predictable, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and while it leaves a lingering thought, it lacks the profound depth expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
