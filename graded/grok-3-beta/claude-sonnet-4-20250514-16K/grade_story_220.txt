<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's aloofness and oddity are well-integrated into his navigation of the port, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper emotional nuance. Motivation is clear, but his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc from discovery to purpose, driven by the logbook. Pacing is managed well within the word limit, though some cause-effect links, like Marcus’s sudden alignment with Elena’s routes, feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The port setting and autumnal lull create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere that enhances the theme of forgotten history. Sensory details are evocative, though some opportunities for deeper immersion (e.g., smells of rust or sea) are missed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on corporate control and lost history, with decent use of symbolism (labyrinth as oppression). However, emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a gut-punch resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés, and the concept of reclaiming power through historical discovery is fresh. However, some metaphors (e.g., "wounded season") feel slightly overused, and emotional depth lacks nuanced subtext, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. It leaves a lingering thought about systemic control, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
