<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s portrayal as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, but his motivation to find liberation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution. His elegantly clumsy attribute is mentioned but not consistently reflected in actions or voice, missing opportunities for richer character texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the action of dissecting experiences feels loosely tied to staking out ghost tours, lacking strong cause-effect logic. Pacing is adequate within the word limit, though the ending feels slightly rushed, diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is unique and enhances the ghostly atmosphere effectively, with sensory details like the “dissonance of silence” creating mood. However, the connection between setting and timeframe (lunch breaks) feels incidental rather than integral to the narrative’s tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus’s realization about witnessing stories, and the ending is purposeful. Imagery like “eyes holding centuries of coastal storms” is striking, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the theme of bridging worlds lacks deeper subtext or layered meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise of a ghost-seeing technician is somewhat original, the story leans on familiar ghost story tropes without significant subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh, but emotional resonance relies more on stating insights than showing nuanced reactions, limiting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length seems deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is modest, lacking a profound question or feeling.</comment>
