<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Deputy Martinez's impassivity is well-integrated into her actions and motivations, shaping her reserved approach to the cathedral's mysteries. However, her inner transformation lacks depth; the shift toward seeking grace feels underdeveloped within the word limit, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete with a clear beginning and end, driven by Martinez's recurring visits, but the pacing is uneven—key revelations are rushed at the climax, undermining impact. Logical flow is maintained, though the oil change timeframe feels forced and tangential to the core narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned cathedral and lush orchard create a striking, surreal atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like the bees' humming and stained glass light. The setting powerfully supports the tone of cautious bravery and the concept of uncharted echoes, though the timeframe integration feels arbitrary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through its imagery and the transcendent bee dance, with strong subtext about seeking beyond protocol. However, the emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying on telling rather than showing Martinez's inner journey. The ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its surreal setting and bee language concept, avoiding clichéd tropes. Metaphors like "honeycomb cities" are fresh, but some descriptions verge on purple prose, and emotional handling feels slightly generic, lacking deeper human nuance in Martinez's reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative integration of bees and echoes. However, the oil change timeframe feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though not profound depth.</comment>
