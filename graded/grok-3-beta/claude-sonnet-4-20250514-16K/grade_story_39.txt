<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thora's restlessness as a tailor shapes her meticulous yet anxious demeanor, but her motivations lack depth beyond surface-level survival; her reactions to the lantern are symbolic yet underexplored, missing a personal emotional tie.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a discernible arc despite the word limit, driven by Thora's actions, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between council deception and her response are somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The biodome on Mars enhances the atmosphere of desperation and isolation effectively, with tone aligning well to the concept of endurance, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Thora's resolve, and symbolism with the lantern is notable, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch; subtext exists but feels underdeveloped for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overly formulaic, the narrative leans on predictable sci-fi tropes of failing colonies and hidden truths without sufficient subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh, but emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought of rebellion, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
