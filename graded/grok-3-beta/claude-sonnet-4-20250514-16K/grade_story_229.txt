<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra’s mild curiosity as an inventor feels underdeveloped and overshadowed by the emotional weight of Marina’s promise; his motivation is clear but lacks depth in personal stakes or internal conflict beyond fulfilling her wish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed toward the resolution, and the rain patterns as a method lack sufficient grounding to fully drive coherence in the fantastical premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sailing ship graveyard is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the cosmic intimacy, though the connection between setting and timeframe (whispered secret) feels slightly tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response and uses evocative imagery (rain as memory), but the theme of circular time feels heavy-handed at times, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of reconstructing the past via rain is inventive, some metaphors (rain as existence) border on clichéd, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brevity feels intentional, but the style sometimes overreaches into ornate language, slightly muddling clarity and impact.</comment>
