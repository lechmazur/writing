<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original concept of dream theft stands out, but execution relies on familiar sci-fi tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering question about identity, though depth is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
