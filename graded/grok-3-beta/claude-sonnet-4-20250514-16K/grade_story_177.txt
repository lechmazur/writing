<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kestra's rebellious nature and unique role as a traveler writing obituaries for the living are intriguing, but her inner motivations lack depth and specificity, making her feel somewhat archetypal rather than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of manifesting past performers driving the narrative, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than causal, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Giant's Library setting is vividly imagined with strong sensory details like amber light and dust motes, enhancing the atmosphere of rebellion and mystery, though the timeframe of revolution feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes an emotional response through its theme of reviving art, with effective symbolism in the mask and organ, but the impact is diminished by occasional telling over showing, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharp punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a theater mask and ghostly performers offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of rebellion against oppression without sufficient subversion, and some imagery, like "waves of pure emotion," feels generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the mask and organ, leaving a lingering thought about art's power, but overly ornate language at times hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
