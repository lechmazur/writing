<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kazuki's transformation from arrogance to vulnerability is evident, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper insight into his past rejection of calligraphy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns; the connection between singing and authorization is logical but underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The courtyard setting enhances the cultural depth and complements the tone of harsh tenderness, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kazuki's tears and song, with effective symbolism in the tapestry and brush, but the dialogue occasionally feels stilted, and subtext is present yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the warrior-to-artist redemption arc feels somewhat predictable; metaphors like "armor cracking" are serviceable but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance is shown but not deeply unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought of redemption, though the style occasionally lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
