<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s confidence as a watchman and his underlying envy are portrayed with some depth, but his motivation feels inconsistently developed; the shift from bitterness to wonder lacks nuanced progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the discovery of fingerprint patterns driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant beehive setting is vividly described with cathedral-like imagery, enhancing the tone of wonder, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about human connection to nature, with strong symbolism in the hive and fingerprints, but the emotional impact is dampened by occasional telling over showing, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fingerprint patterns mirroring bee dances is original, some metaphors (e.g., “cathedral of science and soul”) feel overused, and emotional expression occasionally lacks nuance, bordering on formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the beehive and yearning, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
