<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s dry wit is present and shapes his personality, but his deeper motivations and emotional transformation lack depth; the shift to accepting the keeper role feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of confiscating driving initial tension, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the dance as a method of revelation strains logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is evocatively described with sensory details like salt air, enhancing the atmosphere, though the tone of reckless precision occasionally jars with the somber mood of eroding promises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of legacy, with strong symbolism in the rope, but dialogue is minimal and the ending feels more conceptual than viscerally satisfying; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on ghostly communication via dance, some metaphors (e.g., rope as promises) feel predictable, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at critical moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the rope and dance, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
