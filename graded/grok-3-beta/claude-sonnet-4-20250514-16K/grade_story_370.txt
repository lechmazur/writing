<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a passive conspirator is clear and tied to her rebellion against corporate constraints, but her personality lacks depth beyond this inherited defiance; her voice is indistinct despite the personal connection to the comic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with Maya's subtle data manipulations driving a quiet rebellion, but pacing feels unevenâ€”introspective moments slow the momentum, and the resolution lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quantum foam setting is vividly described with ethereal imagery, enhancing the mood of possibility, though sensory details are somewhat repetitive (e.g., "sands" metaphor overused); atmosphere supports the buried optimism well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through generational hope, with decent use of symbolism (comic as rebellion), but subtext feels heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful but not particularly striking or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the quantum foam concept offers some originality, the generational rebellion trope feels familiar without fresh subversion; metaphors like "cosmic sand" are somewhat generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent in combining quantum mechanics with personal legacy, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
