<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters lack depth beyond their shared secret; Marcusâ€™s past as a carefree gambler feels superficial and underexplored in action or voice, while motivations are stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; the refocus action drives the narrative minimally, and pacing is uneven with a rushed ending lacking clear resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The reverse engineering workshop setting is evocative and ties to the blueprint, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of "hammered repose" feels inconsistently applied against the tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story lacks strong emotional impact or memorable subtext; dialogue is functional but not distinctive, and the central conflict feels underdeveloped with minimal showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and stated emotions rather than nuanced reactions; lacks originality in perspective and relies on predictable tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but lacks depth or lingering impact; elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of polish rather than deliberate craft.</comment>
