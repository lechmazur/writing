<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the boy’s healing as a resolution, and the action of manufacturing miracles drives the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village setting is evocative and complements the tone of dreadful hope, with sensory details like groaning branches enhancing atmosphere, though deeper integration with the hammer’s history could elevate immersion.</comment>
