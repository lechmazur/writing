<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s aloofness as an orphan shapes her initial detachment, and her motivation to protect herself from loss is clear, but her emotional shift feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or gradual progression, weakening the authenticity of her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the gravitational anomaly and stones driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—early detachment lingers too long, and the resolution rushes, leaving cause-effect links between Maya’s realization and action somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like upward-drifting dust and suspended tools, enhancing the atmosphere of uncertainty, though the garage cleaning timeframe feels underexplored as a source of mood or tension beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Maya’s loosening grip on fear, with strong symbolism in the stones, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the theme of adaptation is clear but not profoundly layered or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of gravitational anomaly and humming stones offers originality, the emotional arc of an aloof orphan softening feels somewhat predictable, and sensory details, though evocative, occasionally lean on generic descriptors like “weightless photographs” without fresh nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements like the stones and anomaly, but the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, and the lingering impact is modest, lacking a truly haunting question or feeling to elevate it beyond the narrative.</comment>
