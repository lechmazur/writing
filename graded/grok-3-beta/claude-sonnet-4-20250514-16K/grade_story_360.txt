<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's meekness and sincerity are well-integrated into his personality and actions as a necromancer, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the generic pursuit of wisdom, missing a personal stake or nuanced conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of regaining insight driving the story, but the pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the dew drop revelation and the universal riddle is somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly described with evocative sensory details like crystalline shadows and playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone, though the connection between setting and the broken pen feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on imperfection through strong symbolism of the broken pen, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition rather than showing; the theme of brokenness is clear yet lacks subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on a necromancer seeking wisdom over power, it leans on predictable metaphors like "smoke through fingers" and lacks truly fresh imagery; emotional nuance is present but stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on imperfection, though not profoundly.</comment>
