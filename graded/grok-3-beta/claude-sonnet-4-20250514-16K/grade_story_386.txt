<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kestra's motivation to heal temporal rifts and reunite her people is clear and aligns with her quietly defiant nature, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her "trustworthy strange" attribute feels underexplored in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit with a beginning (refugee stasis), middle (preparation), and end (hopeful signal), but the catapult action feels slightly contrived as a narrative driver; pacing is managed but rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is vividly realized with sensory details like "crystalline walls pulsing with borrowed dawn light," enhancing the mood of quiet defiance; however, the connection between setting and timeframe feels somewhat abstract and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through hope's rekindling, with effective imagery like "borrowed dawn," but lacks deeper subtext or complex conflict; the ending is satisfying yet predictable, missing a truly memorable twist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers an original blend of sci-fi and emotional longing, some metaphors like "broken corridors of time" feel generic; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the tablecloth as a star chart, and it leaves a lingering sense of hope; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
