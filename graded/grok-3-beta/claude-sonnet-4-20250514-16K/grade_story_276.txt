<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation for redemption is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; her uneasy emissary role feels underexplored in action or dialogue, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, connecting Maya's personal journey to debris tracking, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station setting enhances the theme of mistakes and redemption, with sensory details like postcard rustles adding atmosphere, though some sensory elements feel repetitive and less evocative over time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response through the interplay of human stories and cold data, with effective symbolism in the coathanger and postcards, but the emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, lacking deeper subtext in character reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of merging human observation with data is original, some metaphors (e.g., "fallen stars") feel overused, and emotional descriptions occasionally lean toward stating rather than showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like postcards and the coathanger, leaving a lingering thought about redemption, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication due to uneven emotional impact and stylistic repetition.</comment>
