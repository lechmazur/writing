<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development of Kara as a hushed necromancer feels underdeveloped; her necromantic abilities are mentioned but not deeply integrated into her personality or motivations beyond utility. Motivation to map caves is clear but lacks emotional depth or conflict. Dialogue and bond with Devon provide a glimpse of voice, but it’s not distinct enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within the word limit with a clear beginning (exploration), middle (discovery), and end (collaboration), but the action of 'dominate' feels forced and lacks specificity in execution. Pacing is adequate, though the story feels slightly rushed in emotional beats. Cause and effect are logical, but the arc lacks a strong climactic moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like vibrations and ethereal glow, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone and supporting Kara’s necromantic method. However, the timeframe 'between sets' feels underutilized and disconnected from the atmosphere or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes mild emotional resonance through the bond over old movies, but lacks a strong central conflict or tension beyond the generic need for resources. Imagery of crystals and nostalgia is effective but not memorable. The ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying. Dialogue is natural but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining necromancy with sci-fi terraforming, but the emotional handling feels surface-level with stated rather than shown feelings. Metaphors like geological memory are fresh but sparse. Writing style is clear but lacks a unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly integrated, though some like 'between sets' feel peripheral. Style supports clarity but lacks flair. The brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and while there’s creative potential in the setup, it doesn’t leave a strong lingering impact.</comment>
