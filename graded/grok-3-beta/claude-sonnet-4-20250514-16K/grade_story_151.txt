<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena Voss's motivation to restore emotion is clear, but her personality feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the veil beyond intellectual curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible within the word limit, with a logical progression from discovery to decision, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the moral dilemma's resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes create a striking, cohesive atmosphere that enhances the tone of loss and isolation, with vivid sensory details like moonlight through the veil; however, some elements feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about emotion's value and uses strong imagery (veil as stars, ice as broken hearts), but the emotional impact is diluted by overly explicit themes and a lack of subtle conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of emotion via snowflake patterns is original, some metaphors (e.g., "ghost teaching stars to dream") feel forced and purple, and Elena's reasoning leans too logical, missing human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overly ornate style occasionally hinders clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
