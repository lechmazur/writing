<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edgar's curiosity as a mortician drives the narrative, but his transformation into a wilder persona feels underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though the spirits’ role could be more integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details of the mangrove labyrinth and spirit songs; the setting powerfully enhances the mood, though the timeframe’s impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes wonder through imagery and theme of preserving dreams, with satisfying subtext; however, emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in blending mortician role with supernatural archiving, but reliance on familiar ghostly tropes and generic descriptors like "ethereal light" dulls uniqueness; metaphors are occasionally overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought about dreams and death, though depth is not fully explored.</comment>
