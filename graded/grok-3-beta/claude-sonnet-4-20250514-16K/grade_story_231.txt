<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Enkidu's sentimental and spontaneous nature is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and inconsistent at times; the shift from shepherd to justice-seeker lacks depth in backstory or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the action of boasting and the coordinates, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the resolution of justice via fire lacks detailed cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Sumerian palace setting is evocative and ties well to the timeframe of the ship’s departure, enhancing the atmosphere of chaos, though sensory details are sparse and could be more immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Enkidu’s prayer and the scribe’s sacrifice, with decent symbolism in the hairpin, but the conflict resolution feels abrupt, and the theme of justice lacks nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the shepherd-turned-hero trope is predictable; emotional resonance is present but stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with the assigned elements, and chaos as a teacher offers a lingering thought, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
