<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's tension as a bodyguard shapes his rigid demeanor effectively, and his motivation to protect his sister’s memory is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning (tension), middle (revelation), and end (resolve), but pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks specificity to feel fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (transparent aluminum, Earth’s view) and enhances the serene anger tone; however, the atmosphere’s connection to Marcus’s motivation feels underdeveloped beyond symbolic isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Marcus’s resolve, with some effective imagery (Earth as a blue marble), but the conflict resolution feels predictable; subtext about control exists but lacks deeper exploration within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the lunar setting offers a unique backdrop, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of betrayal and revenge without significant subversion; metaphors like “serene anger settling like gravity” are fresh, but emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length seems intentional; however, the style lacks the polish for top-tier publication, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
