<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marla's motivation to cross sacred boundaries is clear, but her personality and voice feel underdeveloped. The "expectantly resigned" attribute is mentioned but not deeply reflected in her actions or internal conflict, leaving her character somewhat flat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and crescendo at the end.

However, the setting occasionally overshadows character motivation, slightly unbalancing the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through vivid imagery and a sense of cosmic duty, with effective metaphors like the "crown of light." Yet, the emotional depth and central conflict remain surface-level, missing deeper subtext or a truly satisfying resolution.</comment>
