<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kira's uniquely literal mindset is intriguing and shapes her dismissal of ghosts, but her motivation lacks depth beyond the functional goal of decoding maps; her personality feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc from discovery to transmission, driven by overcharging the lighthouse, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, but the resolution lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-war timeframe are evocatively paired, enhancing the eerie tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion; atmosphere supports the concept well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on humanity's survival, with some symbolism in the star maps, but lacks strong emotional resonance or subtext; the ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying; writing shows over telling but isn't striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on post-apocalyptic escape, avoiding overt clich√©s, but character reasoning feels overly mechanical; imagery is functional but not memorable, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the phone booth key, but the style is utilitarian rather than evocative; it leaves a lingering idea of hope, though the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
