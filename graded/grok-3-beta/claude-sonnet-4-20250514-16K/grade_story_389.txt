<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Erasmus's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; the "formally casual" attribute feels superficial and doesn't significantly shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of "optimizing" driving the narrative, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to the beginning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting of the forgotten library in an abandoned mine is evocative and complements the tone of mystery, with strong sensory details like dust and rotting floorboards; however, the timeframe's significance feels underexplored.</comment>
