<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Viktor's transition from artist to assassin is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the theft of his work lacks emotional depth or specificity, making his actions seem more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—too much focus on setting detracts from tension buildup, and the resolution via forgiveness feels abrupt and unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly realized with evocative details like recycled tears and weeping sculptures, enhancing the mood of manufactured beauty, though sensory immersion occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., borrowed starlight) adds depth, and the theme of forgiveness offers subtext, but the emotional impact is diluted by a rushed ending and dialogue that feels more poetic than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the setting and imagery show originality, the assassin’s arc and themes of betrayal lean on familiar tropes without subversion; metaphors, though creative, sometimes veer into overwrought territory, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with imaginative elements, but overemphasis on style occasionally hinders clarity; the brief length feels somewhat restrictive, limiting deeper emotional resonance or lingering impact.</comment>
