<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed transitions; the blacksmith’s clang as a plot driver is creative yet not fully justified in context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels deliberate, yet depth is limited by rushed character exploration.</comment>
