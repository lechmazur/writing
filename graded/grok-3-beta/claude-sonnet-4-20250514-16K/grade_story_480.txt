<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but her motivation lacks depth beyond a vague curiosity; her "quietly loud" attribute is mentioned but not convincingly shown in action or dialogue, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the action of reigniting a connection drives the story, though cause-effect links are somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting enhances the eerie tone and supports the concept of digital hauntings; sensory details like rusted windows and echoing footsteps are evocative, though deeper integration with character motivation is lacking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has a mild emotional impact through its unique premise, but literary devices are sparse, and the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying; dialogue is minimal and functional, lacking natural depth or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, avoiding common tropes, but some descriptions (e.g., "glitch in a corrupted file") feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but underdeveloped, and the tone is mostly consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the brief length exposes shallow character depth; it leaves a lingering thought about digital hauntings, though clarity is occasionally hindered by underdeveloped motives.</comment>
