<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia and motivation to preserve truth through art are clear and consistent, shaping her actions effectively. However, her personality lacks depth beyond her vigil, and her voice, while evocative, doesn't fully distinguish itself in the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with scrying driving Mira's journey, but pacing feels uneven—some emotional beats are rushed. Cause and effect are logical, yet the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger climactic punch for true completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboreal workshop among giant mushrooms is vividly realized with sensory detail, enhancing the surreal, mournful atmosphere. The tone of regret complements the concept, though the setting's connection to the classroom timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mira's vigil and the bullet-holed hat's symbolism, with clear subtext about trauma. However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and while imagery is strong, the central conflict lacks sharper tension or resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story shows originality in combining surreal elements with trauma, avoiding overt clichés. Yet, some metaphors (e.g., mushrooms as mourners) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies at times on stating Mira's state rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, leaving a lingering sadness. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
