<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map weather patterns is clear, but Kallos’ personality feels underdeveloped; "tactically reckless" is stated but not deeply shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and impactful end, but pacing feels rushed in the final revelations, undermining the weight of the discovery within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The forgotten library setting is evocative and enhances the tone of "electric peace," with strong sensory details like humming energy, though tactile and olfactory elements are underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about climate intelligence, with decent subtext, but the ending feels slightly overwrought and dialogue lacks distinctiveness; conflict resolution is ambitious but abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of sentient weather, but some metaphors (e.g., "paper canyons") feel slightly forced, and emotional depth relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about humanity’s role, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
