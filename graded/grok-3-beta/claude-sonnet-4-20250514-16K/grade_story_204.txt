<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's role as a professional cuddler shapes her cautious interactions and emotional depth well, with clear motivation tied to societal perceptions; however, her distinct voice is somewhat muted, and the reaction to the ticket punch feels more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the acceptance speech providing resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end relies heavily on thematic rather than causal links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly rendered with sensory details like rusting gantries and light through ceiling gaps, enhancing the mood of decay; however, the atmosphere’s connection to Maya’s motivation feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through the grandfather’s story, with effective symbolism in the ticket punch, but the ending feels more contemplative than impactful, and the central conflict of societal prejudice is implied rather than sharply defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “tiny ghosts” of dust) feel slightly overused, and emotional handling leans toward explicit statement over nuanced subtext at times, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the spaceport and cuddler role, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate imagery, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
