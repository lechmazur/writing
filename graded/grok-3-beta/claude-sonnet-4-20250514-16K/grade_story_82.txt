<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's reluctance and analytical playfulness are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to become the voice of the unknown feels abrupt and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory to ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the dragon tooth driving the resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the curse-lifting mechanism lacks sufficient explanation for coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The futuristic hub and hidden sunrise create a vivid atmosphere, enhanced by evocative details like neon towers and silver-green leaves, though sensory immersion could be deeper with more varied tactile or auditory cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of bridging past and present, but literary devices like the glowing tooth feel somewhat predictable, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of dragons in a futuristic setting offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar cursed-land tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength, and the overall impact lacks the depth needed for a lasting impression.</comment>
