<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Minerva's telepathic nature and tragic joy shape her actions, but her motivation feels slightly abstract; deeper personal stakes or nuanced internal conflict could elevate her character beyond a symbolic figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear within the word limit, with a discernible beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (e.g., societal impact) are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like copper-scented rain and hissing pipes, enhancing the gloomy atmosphere, though the setting's integration with character motivation feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., ink-like consciousness) and emotional resonance in the revelation of truths stand out, but the ending lacks a sharper punch, and some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "sunshine through steam") feel overused, and emotional descriptions occasionally lack nuance, leaning toward explicit statement over subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the hair tie, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
