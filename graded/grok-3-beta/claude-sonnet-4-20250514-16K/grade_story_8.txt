<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lord Caspian's dazed nobility and rebellious nature are well-defined, with clear motivation to challenge tradition, but his internal conflict lacks deeper emotional nuance; actions align with motivation, yet his voice feels somewhat distant and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the act of retooling stories, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the ending lacks a stronger resolution to fully tie the narrative together.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The composer's sound garden is evocatively described with sensory details like metallic whispers and wooden groans, enhancing the atmosphere and complementing Caspian's motivation; however, the timeframe of "between lectures" feels underexplored and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about tradition versus truth and employs effective imagery (e.g., chalk revelations), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext; the central conflict is clear, though the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in retooling family lore through sidewalk messages, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "cosmic dance") feel slightly generic; emotional resonance is present but relies too often on stated feelings rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought about truth versus tradition, though not powerfully so.</comment>
