<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around guilt and reincarnation is clear, but Marcus's "tentatively fierce" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels incomplete; the connection between guilt and the recipe library is tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten recipe library is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the storm's dramatic irony feels overplayed, diluting atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance with guilt as a theme, but reliance on overt metaphors (e.g., "cosmic luggage") and stated emotions undermines subtext; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is unique, execution leans on predictable reincarnation tropes without subversion; metaphors like "ripples in stagnant water" are generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they feel forced rather than organic; style is functional but lacks distinction, and brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
