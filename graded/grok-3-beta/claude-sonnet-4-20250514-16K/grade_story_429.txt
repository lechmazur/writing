<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maja's earthy farmer trait shapes her patience and precision, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced layers beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical cause-effect with the aurora and recordings, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; coherence holds, though the resolution lacks depth within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The northern lights setting and aurora folding timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; tone of hushed euphoria complements the concept, though some connections to the scale feel slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maja's connection to her ancestors and has satisfying subtext of reclaimed knowledge; imagery is strong, but the conflict feels understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of restoring recordings via spices and aurora is original, but some descriptors feel generic; emotional resonance is present but leans on stated feelings over nuanced showing; metaphors are fresh yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
