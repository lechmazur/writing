<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's character as a lukewarm mage is distinct and shapes her subtle, nostalgic actions, but her motivation feels somewhat surface-level; the emotional depth of her longing for home isn’t fully explored beyond the doormat's symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and reflective end, but the clash feels underdeveloped as a driving action, and pacing is uneven with overly descriptive interludes slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar base setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like mechanical hums and recycled air, enhancing the tone of isolation, though the connection between the doormat and setting feels slightly forced despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Mira’s longing, with effective imagery like ghostly furniture, but lacks deeper subtext or a fully satisfying resolution; the central conflict remains understated and unresolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of clinging to echoes is unique, some metaphors (e.g., "painting a future") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit description than nuanced showing, slightly diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering mood but not profound thought.</comment>
