<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's selective mutism and ventriloquism are well-integrated through Marvin, but motivations feel slightly inconsistentâ€”optimism overshadows deeper emotional conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but rushed; overheard conversations drive the story, yet pacing feels uneven with abrupt emotional shifts within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Parallel universe beach is vividly described with strong sensory detail (aurora lights, purple sand), enhancing atmosphere, though object connection to setting feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through family themes and uses weather as effective symbolism, but dialogue via Marvin feels slightly forced; ending is satisfying yet predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining ventriloquism and parallel dimensions, but metaphors (weather patterns for emotions) are somewhat overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly deep.</comment>
