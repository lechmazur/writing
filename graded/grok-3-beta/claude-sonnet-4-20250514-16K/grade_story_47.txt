<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena's dutiful nature and jaded eagerness shape her actions, but her motivation feels slightly underwritten—lacking deeper emotional nuance beyond solving the mystery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by solving the mystery, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing finer emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary setting is evocative and ties to the mood, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion; atmosphere supports motivation but lacks depth in texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes moderate emotional impact with a satisfying ending, uses symbolism (glove as truth), but dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors (e.g., glove as magic) feel slightly predictable; emotional handling is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity limits depth; it leaves a lingering thought about justice, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
