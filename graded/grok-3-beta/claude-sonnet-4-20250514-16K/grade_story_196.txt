<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present with Kael's hidden promise and defiance, but his personality lacks depth beyond exhaustion and apathy; his voice feels generic despite the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with Kael's leap into the unknown, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between resignation and meteors is underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating monastery and meteor showers create a striking atmosphere, with sensory details like wind and twilight enhancing mood, though the settingâ€™s deeper connection to motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with Kael's defiance, and imagery of meteors is strong, but subtext is shallow, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of following meteors offers some originality, the tired swordsman trope feels predictable, and emotional handling leans toward stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of meteors and the monastery, but lacks profound lingering impact or depth; the brevity feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
