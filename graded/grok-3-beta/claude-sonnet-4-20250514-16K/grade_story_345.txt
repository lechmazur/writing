<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Father Marcus's motivation to break free from complacency and fate is clear, and his confusion shapes his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the crisis; his voice feels more symbolic than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with jogging driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between snow patterns and progression are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and perpetual mist create a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of dull radiance and Marcus's quest; sensory details like creaking stalks are evocative, though smell and taste are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (abacus as faith) are strong, and the ending evokes curiosity, but emotional resonance is limited by 'telling' over 'showing'; the central theme of questioning faith is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a lapsed priest in a surreal maze is intriguing, some metaphors (snow as mathematics) feel forced, and emotional portrayal leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext; style is distinct but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but overreliance on symbolic language slightly hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering question about truth, though the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
