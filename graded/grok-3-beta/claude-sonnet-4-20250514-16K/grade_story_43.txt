<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's wariness and introversion are evident, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the spark of courage emerges too abruptly without deeper internal conflict or gradual transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels unevenâ€”meandering slows momentum, and the resolution via the CD feels convenient rather than earned; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are weak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The neon cathedral and post-human timeframe create a striking, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details (neon light, electric hymns); however, the fog and fireflies occasionally clash tonally with the digital setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (fireflies as courage) are impactful, and the ending carries emotional weight, but the story leans on explicit statements of theme rather than showing; subtext is present but not fully layered or subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, metaphors like "fireflies in fog" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and the narrative occasionally borders on predictable sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but it lacks the depth and polish for top-tier publication; style supports the mood, yet the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
