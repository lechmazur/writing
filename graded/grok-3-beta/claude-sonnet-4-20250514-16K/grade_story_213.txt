<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from wedding to revolution is coherent with a satisfying resolution within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the destruction of the old system lacks detailed buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The photosynthesis lab setting is vividly realized and enhances the story’s themes, with strong sensory details like bioluminescent glow; however, the wedding atmosphere occasionally clashes tonally with the scientific gravitas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about innovation and belief, with strong imagery like “photosynthetic poetry,” but the emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions, and the ending, while striking, lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
