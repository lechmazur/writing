<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation for justice is clear and ties to his past trauma, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond the “artfully clumsy” facade, lacking depth in voice or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between flattery and mirror distortions isn’t fully logical or seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned bus terminal setting enhances the mood of isolation, and sensory details are present, but the atmosphere isn’t deeply tied to the virtual calls timeframe, missing opportunities for richer integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of justice, and the mirror as a symbol works, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and subtext is present yet not deeply layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of mirror distortions offers originality, and metaphors are fresh, but emotional handling leans on stating trauma rather than showing nuanced reactions, and the narrative risks predictability in its vigilante trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mirror and bead, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
