<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape perceptual limitations is clear and tied to the hope-worn attribute, but Cassian's deeply superficial nature feels underexplored beyond surface-level actions, lacking deeper nuance or voice in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness within the word limit with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven; the transformation at the end is abrupt, and cause-effect links between miracles and actions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating library setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the ethereal tone and supporting the concept of miracles, though the connection between the seashell and setting feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (seashell, library dissolving) and subtext about perception creates impact, but emotional resonance is inconsistent; the ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper reflection or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in blending myth and reality, but reliance on familiar knight-seeking-redemption trope and generic descriptors for miracles detracts; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often ornate, veering into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the surreal tone, but style occasionally obscures clarity with overcomplex language; lingering thought is present but not profound.</comment>
