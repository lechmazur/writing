<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to become a master of empathy feels underdeveloped and somewhat inconsistent with the cautious smuggler persona; Marcus's internal shift lacks depth despite intriguing hints at transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit, and the connection between smuggling and empathy-building isn’t fully logical or seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drought prediction center setting enhances the thematic weight of weather and emotion, supported by evocative sensory details like the butterfly catching light, though deeper atmospheric immersion is possible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (butterfly, landscapes) and subtext about empathy as prediction, but emotional resonance is uneven, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending weather prediction with emotional insight, but metaphors like “weather lived in people’s bones” feel slightly overused; emotional handling shows nuance yet occasionally states rather than shows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about empathy, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
