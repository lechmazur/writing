<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mysterious hermit's motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "rebellious" label; her actions align with her purpose, though her voice feels more symbolic than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the act of translating via the weathervane, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links between the comet and planting success are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a striking apocalyptic atmosphere that complements the hermit's motivation; sensory details like the amber glow and blackened bark are evocative, though some elements (e.g., smell) are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet hope and uses strong imagery (e.g., skeletal trees as prayers), with subtle subtext about resilience; however, the central conflict feels understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharp emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique take on rebellion and renewal, with fresh metaphors like "genetic memories"; yet, some descriptors (e.g., "apocalyptic sky") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the weathervane and pressed flowers; the style supports clarity, but the short length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
