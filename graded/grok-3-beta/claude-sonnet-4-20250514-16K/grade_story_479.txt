<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear, and Vivian's glamour as an undertaker is reflected in her appearance, but her personality lacks depth beyond obsession with family legacy; reactions feel predictable, missing a distinct voice or nuanced layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between searching archives and soul-measuring is logical but underexplored, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of reverence for death work is strong, supported by sensory details like the paint jar and brass tape, but the social network setting feels underutilized and disconnected from the mystical tone; timeframe integration is weak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through Vivian’s tears, with some effective symbolism in the measuring tape, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict is present but resolves too neatly, missing tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality in combining death work with sacred geometry is notable, but writing occasionally leans on predictable descriptors like “trembling hands”; emotional portrayal shows some nuance, though it borders on stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels mostly cohesive with creative use of elements like the brass tape, but brevity seems to limit depth rather than enhance it; leaves a faint lingering thought about death’s artistry, though not powerfully so.</comment>
