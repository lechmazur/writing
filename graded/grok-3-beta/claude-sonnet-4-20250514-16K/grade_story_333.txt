<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation as a preservationist and sincere rebel is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single trait; her voice isn’t distinct enough to elevate her character beyond functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between secrets and symbols feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and stormy timeframe are vividly rendered with strong sensory details like the copper taste and pulsing walls, enhancing the mood; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motivation, reducing immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Maya’s legacy burden, with effective symbolism in the symbols and secrets; yet, the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in the concept of spiritual architecture, metaphors like “living throat” feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, limiting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the sticky note and secrets, but the style occasionally leans toward melodrama, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about legacy, though not profoundly so.</comment>
