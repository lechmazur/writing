<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation to restore the carousel is clear and tied to personal history, but his personality lacks depth beyond nostalgia; his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between decoding the tapestry and emotional growth are logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alpine monastery setting is evocative and contrasts well with Marcus’s desert background; sensory details are present but lack specificity to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through nostalgia, and the storm metaphor is effective, but subtext is shallow, and the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown; metaphors are serviceable but not striking, lacking a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a clear theme of healing, but the style is functional rather than remarkable; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks deeper impact.</comment>
