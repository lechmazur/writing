<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit with a logical flow from problem to resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and enhances the mystical atmosphere, complementing the bridging worlds concept; however, sensory details beyond steam and cold are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kaelâ€™s quiet satisfaction, with some effective symbolism (hermit crabs), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable style; it shows more than tells, yet conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
