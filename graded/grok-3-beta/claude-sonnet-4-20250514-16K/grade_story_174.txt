<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kenji’s motivation to honor Yuki through fireworks is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond regret; his actions align with his goal, yet his voice feels muted and underdeveloped for a protagonist of this emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the discovery and overly reflective at the end; connections between elements like frost patterns and the library are intriguing but not fully logical or coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hidden library behind a waterfall is vividly atmospheric and enhances the story’s mystical tone; sensory details of mist and frost are effective, though the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the theme of regret and redemption, with strong imagery of fireworks as leaves; however, the ending feels more poetic than satisfying, and subtext is present but not deeply layered or nuanced enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of memory-infused fireworks is original, some metaphors (e.g., “bloom and fade like memories”) feel overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable tropes of loss without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like pressed leaves and frost patterns, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not a profound or unique one.</comment>
