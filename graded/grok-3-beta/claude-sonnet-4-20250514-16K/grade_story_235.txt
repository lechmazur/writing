<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation as a remote herbalist is clear, tied to his isolation and obsession with pressed flowers and celestial patterns, but his personality lacks depth beyond this singular focus; Yuki remains a cipher, with no distinct voice or agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (watching students), middle (meteor shower decoding), and end (placing the book), but pacing feels uneven, with overemphasis on symbolism slowing momentum; cause and effect are logical but lack tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ancient Japanese castle setting and art class timeframe are evocative, with sensory details like moonlight on easels enhancing mood; the atmosphere supports the distant intimacy, though some descriptions border on generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet melancholy and uses symbolism effectively (flowers, meteors), with subtext of unspoken love; however, the emotional impact is diluted by repetitive imagery, and the ending feels more wistful than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding meteors with flowers is original, metaphors like "petals arranged like constellations" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth in character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like meteors and flowers, leaving a lingering sense of yearning; however, the style occasionally overreaches into ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
