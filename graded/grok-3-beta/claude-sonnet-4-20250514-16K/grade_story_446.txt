<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Marcus’s drive to restore Valdris, and his amiable exterior contrasts well with inner fury, but his personality lacks depth beyond the obsession; actions align with motivation, yet his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of hydrolyzing pages driving a symbolic narrative, but pacing feels uneven—introspection overshadows action, and coherence suffers from underdeveloped cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds create a vivid, evocative atmosphere that enhances the tone of peaceful anger and supports Marcus’s ritual, though sensory details are inconsistently detailed and timeframe integration feels peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on restoration and guilt via strong symbolism (unbecoming), but emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; ending is purposeful, yet central conflict lacks sharpness within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concept of unbecoming is original and metaphors like petals falling are fresh, but some descriptors (e.g., “nature’s ancient rhythms”) feel generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but style occasionally leans toward overwrought phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
