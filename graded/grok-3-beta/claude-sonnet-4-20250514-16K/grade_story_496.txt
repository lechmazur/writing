<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation as a repressed poet is clear, but his transition from fear to purpose feels rushed and lacks depth in internal conflict; his voice is present but not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the spontaneous decision driving the narrative, but the pacing feels uneven, and the resolution of doubts into purpose is too abrupt for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown city street setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of reclamation and mystery; however, the connection between the setting and the perfume bottle feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's rebellion against repression, with effective imagery like the "green cathedral," but the ending lacks a deeper punch, and the theme of healing through poetry feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, others like "wild animal pouncing" are clich√©d; the narrative shows individual style but occasionally relies on predictable emotional descriptors, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the perfume bottle, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
