<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elenaâ€™s amiability is present but underdeveloped, lacking depth in interactions; her motivation to prove maritime folklore theories is clear but not fully explored within the word limit, missing nuanced emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arcs decently from discovery to revelation within constraints, with the crossword and vibrations driving the story; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between timber stories and crossword clues could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly realized with sensory details like vibrating timbers and dancing shadows, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; the setting strongly supports the concept, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and mild wonder through the timber voices, with effective symbolism in the crossword as translation; yet, emotional resonance is limited, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch or lingering conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of timber stories is original, but the execution leans on familiar mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like the crossword as a beacon are fresh but not consistently sharp, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, with creative use of vibrations and shadows; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
