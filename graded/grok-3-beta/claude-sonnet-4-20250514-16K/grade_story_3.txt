<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra’s motivation to decode cosmic patterns is clear and consistent, but his "surly" nature feels underdeveloped and barely reflected in his actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice or deeper personality nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The riddle drives the plot toward a revelation, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end, while present, lacks a fully satisfying resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sailor’s graveyard and the between-seasons timeframe create a haunting, liminal atmosphere that supports the story’s tone of dignified chaos, with evocative sensory details of mist and wind enhancing immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its cosmic market metaphor and has a purposeful ending, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper subtext or nuanced "showing" of Ezra’s internal struggle beyond stated feelings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the metaphor of death as a market is inventive, some sensory details feel generic, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable patterns without fully subverting them, missing a truly unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like market wisdom and the graveyard, but the style sometimes lacks clarity, and the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice, reducing lingering impact.</comment>
