<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to uncover sacred geometry is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the crisis; her reactions feel driven by plot needs rather than distinct traits, resulting in a somewhat generic voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with evasion driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and some cause-effect links (like Chenâ€™s sudden departure) lack clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive enhances the tone of desperate hope and ties meaningfully to the concept of sacred geometry, though sensory details are sparse, limiting deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through the mentor-student bond and offers subtext with sacred geometry, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the writing occasionally tells rather than shows emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of migration patterns and geometry is original, some metaphors feel overused (e.g., "pulse through architecture"), and emotional nuance is inconsistent, leaning on stated feelings at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity sometimes undermines emotional depth, leaving a moderate lingering impact.</comment>
