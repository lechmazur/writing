<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s portrayal as a bluffing swindler is clear, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the internal conflict of revealing truth lacks depth in his reactions and voice, which remain somewhat generic despite dialogue opportunities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the computer restart as a turning point feels convenient rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reclaimed skyscraper orchard setting is vividly realized with sensory details and complements the tone of gentle harshness well, though the atmosphere could further enhance Marcus’s internal struggle with more specific emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the theme of hope versus deception, with effective symbolism in the price tag, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict’s resolution lacks a deeper, lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, the character’s emotional arc relies on somewhat predictable tropes of confession and redemption, and sensory details occasionally feel generic rather than uniquely evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
