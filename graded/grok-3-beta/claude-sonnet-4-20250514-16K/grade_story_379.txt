<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation to preserve disappearing languages is clear and consistent, shaping her actions, but her "impatiently patient" attribute feels underexplored in depth; her voice lacks distinctiveness in the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the cryptic dares, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; coherence is maintained, though the connection between beginning and end could be stronger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly realized with sensory details like bioluminescent glow and recycled air, enhancing the ghostly tone and supporting Kira's motivation, though the timeframe of stretching feels somewhat incidental to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about language preservation and has subtext around chosen paths, with effective imagery like "ghost tongues," but the ending feels more open than satisfying; conflict is present but resolution is underdeveloped within the limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining language rights with a futuristic setting, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors like "dancing with specters" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but not deeply nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about Kira's fate, but the style occasionally leans toward overwritten phrases, slightly hindering clarity; length feels deliberate but not fully optimized.</comment>
