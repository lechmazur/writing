<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra's rebellious nature and motivation to stand by the unremembered are clear and consistent, but her dreamy poet persona lacks depth beyond surface traits; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the thematic alignment with her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of compelling witness-bearing driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The disused railway station and ivy-laden atmosphere are vividly evoked with sensory details, enhancing the quietly intense tone and supporting the concept of delicate undoing, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly understated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of reflection on forgotten histories with strong imagery and symbolism (sundial as witness), but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced character reaction, and the ending feels more conceptual than deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on rebellion via poetry, some metaphors (ivy as reclamation) feel overused, and the emotional resonance relies more on stated purpose than shown nuance, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the sundial and cryptic shapes, leaving a lingering thought about silenced histories, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
