<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's "aggressively kind" nature is intriguing and drives the action, but the spirit's personality lacks depth or distinct voice; motivation feels surface-level and utilitarian rather than emotionally nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a logical cause-effect progression within the word limit, driven by the whistle and dance, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room and rocky shore create a vivid, moody atmosphere that enhances the tone of ancient magic; sensory details like the whale song and salt air are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of preserving tradition, with decent imagery and symbolism, but the conflict feels predictable, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a spirit intervening for tradition is somewhat fresh, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of ghostly guardians and lost rituals without significant subversion; emotional resonance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with decent integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a faint lingering thought about heritage, though not profound enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
