<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's guilt and motivation to honor her sister are clear, but her personality as a wilderness guide feels underexplored; her emotional depth is present but lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction beyond grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between family legacy and the ship’s history is logical yet lacks deeper causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom setting is vividly described with sensory details like chandeliers and mirrors, enhancing the mood of loss and discovery; however, the morning coffee ritual feels slightly disconnected from the underwater atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maya’s grief and reconciliation, with strong imagery like “trapped stars”; yet, the ending feels somewhat predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a sharper emotional punch or subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of underwater archaeology and family vindication offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “water’s embrace”) feel generic; emotional portrayal leans on stating feelings rather than nuanced showing, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the encoded blanket, leaving a lingering sense of healing; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
