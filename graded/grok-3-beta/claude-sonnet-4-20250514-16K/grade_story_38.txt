<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's insomnia and poetic nature are hinted at but not deeply explored; her motivation to honor her family’s legacy is clear but feels somewhat surface-level, lacking deeper emotional nuance or a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between the warnings and the action to eliminate corruption is logical, yet the progression lacks depth and subtlety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway setting create a compelling atmosphere, with sensory details like the train's clacking enhancing mood; however, the integration of setting with character motivation could be more robust and evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Maya’s resolve, with some effective imagery (e.g., "empty abundance"); however, the conflict resolution feels predictable, and the theme of non-violence lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows originality in blending botany and ghostly warnings, some descriptions (e.g., "gentle wisdom of plants") border on cliché; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative style feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, it lacks a truly lingering thought or profound depth, settling for a competent but unremarkable execution.</comment>
