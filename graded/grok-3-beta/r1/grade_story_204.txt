<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila’s role as a professional cuddler is intriguing and shapes her initial detachment, but her motivation to overcome prejudice feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit; her shift in perspective lacks deeper internal conflict or gradual transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the ticket punch driving a pivotal shift, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between past and present isn’t fully fleshed out, leaving some cause-effect links vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly realized with sensory details like rusted ribs and heavy gravity, enhancing the tone of ancient novelty; atmosphere strongly supports the theme of decay, though some setting elements feel underutilized in relation to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on prejudice and history through the ghost trains, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is diluted by a hurried resolution; dialogue is purposeful but lacks distinct voice, and the central conflict resolves too abruptly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining a professional cuddler with a sci-fi ghost train concept, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “ash in the wind”) feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored, and the style is distinctive yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the ticket punch and spaceport, leaving a lingering question about reconciliation; however, the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and some complexity in style slightly obscures clarity.</comment>
