<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaela’s reluctance as a caretaker and her analytically playful nature are evident, but her deeper motivations and personal stakes remain underdeveloped within the tight word limit, leaving her voice somewhat indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the mystery of the orchard driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links, like the tooth’s sudden activation, lack sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The futuristic hub and bioluminescent orchard create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details, though the connection between setting and timeframe (hidden sunrise) feels underutilized in enhancing the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kaela’s gleeful sorrow and offers layers of meaning via the dragons’ elegy, but the ending, while poetic, lacks a fully satisfying resolution; imagery is striking but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding a dragon’s legacy is original, some metaphors (e.g., “sweetness laced with ashes”) feel familiar, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though depth is constrained by the brief length.</comment>
