<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marlow’s transformation into a prophet feels underdeveloped; his motivation lacks depth beyond the flower’s influence, and his “conventionally rebellious” trait is stated but not convincingly shown through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the flower driving events, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between visions and unity are vague, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant’s study is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the haunting tone, though the laundromat setting feels less integrated and the atmosphere occasionally overpowers character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (the flower, fractured light) create impact, and the theme of unity emerges, but emotional resonance is uneven due to limited character depth; the ending satisfies but lacks profound punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, others (e.g., “dried blood”) feel clichéd; the narrative shows style but occasionally slips into ornate prose, and emotional nuance is present but not consistently shown over told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the surreal tone, but overcomplex language sometimes hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not deeply provocative.</comment>
