<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Veyra’s motivation to heal time’s wounds is clear and tied to her identity as a time refugee, but her personality lacks depth beyond quiet defiance; her voice, while distinct, feels more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the catapult action driving the resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the cause-effect of the cloth’s transformation is more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and borrowed dawn tone create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like the humming core; however, the setting’s connection to the character’s motivation feels more aesthetic than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response through Veyra’s sacrifice and uses strong imagery (threads as bridges), but the ending feels more poignant than fully satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the brief scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., lighthouse as needle) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers between ornate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the tablecloth, but the style occasionally leans too heavily on poetic abstraction, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering sense of loss, though not profoundly so.</comment>
