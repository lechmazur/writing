<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cyber-templar’s motivation to shatter the mirage of safety is clear and drives her actions, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "patiently frantic" attribute, lacking deeper nuance or a distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of proving the mirage’s falsity driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the bridle and the storm’s resolution is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like ozone and burnt sage, enhancing the tone of euphoric agitation; however, the timeframe of "during reading" feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of defiance and reflection on safety as a prism, with striking imagery and symbolism, but the central conflict feels slightly overwrought, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying emotional punch within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of cyberpunk and spiritual elements, some metaphors (e.g., storm as serpent) feel overused, and the emotional resonance relies more on stated euphoria than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies; still, the style shows individuality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering question about safety; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and overall impact.</comment>
