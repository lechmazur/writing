<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Zara’s trickster nature is evident in her cunning and deceptive actions, but her deeper motivations feel underexplored beyond surface-level rebellion; her voice is distinct yet lacks emotional depth in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the dare and diversion, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous; cause and effect are logical but lack deeper resonance within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly realized with sensory details like cracking joints and neon-blue slurry, enhancing the ghostly tone; however, the connection between setting and character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Zara’s resolve and ghostly whispers, with strong imagery and subtext about language preservation; yet, the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and the central conflict feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of encoding languages in plant DNA is original, some metaphors (e.g., “summoning ghosts”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style occasionally veers into ornate language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the biodome and dares, but the brief length feels more like a constraint than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought about language loss, though not powerfully so.</comment>
