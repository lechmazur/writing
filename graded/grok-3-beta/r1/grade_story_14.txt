<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Emmett’s naivety as a gambler is evident, but his motivations feel underdeveloped and inconsistent; his obsession with the candle mold lacks deeper grounding beyond Veyra’s influence, missing a distinct personal voice or nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the dock action driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the candle and station crisis are vague, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is vividly realized with sensory details like salt wind and humming machines, enhancing the atmosphere of dread and mystery; the tone aligns well with the concept of unspoken bargains, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and tension through imagery and subtext of debt to the sea, but the ending lacks full satisfaction, and dialogue, while purposeful, isn’t particularly natural; central conflict is present but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors like “sea’s own fire” are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly at the end, disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the tidal station and candle mold, leaving a lingering question about Emmett’s gamble, but overly ambitious complexity within the word limit hinders clarity and depth.</comment>
