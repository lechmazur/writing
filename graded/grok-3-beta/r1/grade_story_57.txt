<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Percival’s submissive nature and aristocratic background are well-integrated into his hesitance and clumsy defiance, but his sudden shift to resolve feels slightly unearned given the brevity of internal conflict shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the liquefaction action driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between yard work and the secret workshop is abrupt, straining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The secret agent workshop setting is vividly described and enhances the action, but sensory details are uneven—some imagery (galaxies under skin) is striking, while others (garden trimming) lack depth; atmosphere supports the tone but isn’t fully immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild empathy through Percival’s connection to the creature, and the ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels slightly stilted; subtext about defying tyranny is present but underdeveloped within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a submissive aristocrat in a sci-fi context is fresh, some descriptions (e.g., “starlight warmth”) verge on cliché, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a mild lingering impression.</comment>
