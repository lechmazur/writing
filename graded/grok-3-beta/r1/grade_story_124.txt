<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jessaâ€™s skittish nature and drifter status are evident, but her transformation into a conductor of grace feels underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the loom-reconnection method drives the story but strains believability, and pacing stumbles with abrupt shifts to terraforming outcomes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is vividly realized with sensory details like regolith-dusted tiles, enhancing the rustic tone; however, the barbershop element feels underutilized in atmosphere-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through imagery of holographic forests, and the theme of grace is present, but emotional resonance is muted by over-reliance on telling over showing; dialogue is sparse but purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of weaving grace via a loom is original, some metaphors (e.g., threads as synapses) feel forced; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought about grace, though depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
