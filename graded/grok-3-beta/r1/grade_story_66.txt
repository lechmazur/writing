<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The quiet deserter's motivation to escape war and find belonging is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of a haunted soldier; her actions align with her past, yet her voice feels muted and indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of carbonizing driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and some causal links, like the sudden map revelation, lack grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plant communication study setting is vividly realized with sensory details like chlorophyll whispers, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the timeframe integration feels vague and underutilized in supporting the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cracked mirror, masks) and subtext about cycles of trauma evoke thought, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of breaking cycles is original, some metaphors (e.g., "phantom of belonging") feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the masks and plants, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
