<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s portrayal as an "unsure champion" is evident, and her rational rebellion shapes her actions, but her motivations waver inconsistently under emotional strain, lacking depth in key moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between Elara’s proposal and Tomas’s betrayal lacks sufficient buildup for coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The chalk cliff setting and church bells timeframe are vividly rendered with sensory details like salt-tinged air, enhancing the cheerful gloom, though the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes tension through imperfect love and cultural preservation, with strong imagery like the amber brooch, but the ending feels more symbolic than emotionally satisfying, and dialogue occasionally lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers some fresh metaphors, emotional resonance relies too often on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, and the narrative style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the brooch and cliffs, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is muted by unresolved emotional depth.</comment>
