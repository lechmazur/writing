<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezekielâ€™s portrayal as an unconvinced missionary is evident, and his internal conflict over faith drives his actions, but his motivations lack depth and specificity, feeling somewhat archetypal rather than uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of concealing the fork driving the narrative, but the resolution feels rushed and the cause-effect relationships are muddled by overly symbolic elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glass desert setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the tone of isolation and spiritual struggle, though the connection between the setting and the fork feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its symbolism and subtext about faith as a wound, with striking imagery, but the emotional impact is diluted by overwrought language and an ending that lacks full resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in its metaphors, it leans on familiar tropes of spiritual quests without fully subverting them, and the language occasionally veers into purple prose, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the fork and desert, but the style sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
