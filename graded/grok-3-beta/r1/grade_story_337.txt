<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mei-Ling’s motivation to restore traditional practices is clear and aligns with her role as a cryptic fortune cookie writer, but her personality lacks depth beyond this mission; her voice, while distinct, feels somewhat archetypal and lacks nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the chipped tile driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks full coherence due to abrupt shifts in visionary imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope design studio and timeframe between curfew and sunrise create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the setting’s connection to the chipped tile feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and has a satisfying ending, with effective use of symbolism (cracked tile as a door); yet, the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining fortune cookies with oracles and a futuristic setting, but some metaphors (e.g., “teeth and fate”) feel overused, and emotional handling occasionally lacks nuance, bordering on predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about tradition versus technology; however, the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
