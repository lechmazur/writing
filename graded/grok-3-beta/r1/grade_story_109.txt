<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The knight's cold nature and lawful rebelliousness are evident in his actions and internal conflict, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; the emotional connection to his sister emerges late and lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the altar-building as a central action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between collecting remedies and artistic awakening is tenuous, leaving some cause-effect links unclear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The deserted intersection at midnight creates a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone of loss and rebellion; sensory details like frost and chamomile are evocative, though the secret agent center feels underexplored as a setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mitten, altar) and imagery evokes a quiet emotional response, with subtext about preservation as rebellion; however, the ending feels slightly unresolved, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors (e.g., "second heart") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated loss than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but occasionally ornate, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about redemption, though not powerfully so.</comment>
