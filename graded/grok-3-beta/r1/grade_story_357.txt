<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alaric’s portrayal as a focused collector is clear, and his motivation to preserve solitude aligns with his actions, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; reactions lack nuanced introspection beyond the obvious.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the board game’s logic occasionally overshadows narrative coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The frost giant’s lair is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the mood of isolation, though the connection between setting and black rose feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Alaric’s triumph, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the dialogue feels forced, and the theme of solitude lacks deeper subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on solitude and despair, some metaphors (e.g., “flawed confetti”) feel overwrought, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
