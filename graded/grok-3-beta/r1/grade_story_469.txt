<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and subterranean garden create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like jasmine and mildew, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and reflection on survival, with effective imagery and a satisfying ending, but subtext is somewhat surface-level, and the central theme of modesty feels inconsistently conveyed amidst grandiose descriptions.</comment>
