<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to save her sister is clear, but the overburdened clerk's personality lacks depth beyond exhaustion and duty; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like memory trades; coherence holds, though transitions between worlds are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Undersea greenhouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like silent storms and bioluminescence, enhancing the dissonant calm tone; atmosphere supports the cure-seeking motivation well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through sacrifice and lingering mystery of the clerk’s fate; imagery and symbolism (stamps as doorways) are strong, but subtext feels underdeveloped for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original concept of stamps bridging realms is intriguing, but execution relies on familiar sacrifice tropes without subversion; metaphors are fresh, though emotional nuance is sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like stamps and trivia night, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering question of the clerk’s ultimate fate.</comment>
