<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edith's role as a gossip columnist shapes her actions and motivations, but her sudden shift to prophetic urgency feels underdeveloped; her voice is distinct yet lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between the stuffed ear and future bulletins is intriguing but not fully logical, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber prison setting and honeyed light create a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone of gentle rebellion; sensory details are evocative, though the timeframe of cooking feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its unique premise and imagery, but the emotional impact is diluted by an overreliance on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of future bulletins is original, but some metaphors (e.g., "cumin scattering like rust-colored stars") feel forced; emotional resonance is present but lacks depth due to stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
