<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eirik’s rogue fortune teller persona is intriguing, with clear motivation to archive emotions, but his character lacks depth beyond surface mystique; reactions to the inkwell are symbolic yet underexplored in personal terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the unspoken offer, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional reveals; coherence is maintained, though the ending lacks a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reimagined Viking longhouse setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the fierce repose tone; the atmosphere supports the concept well, though the timeframe’s “overlooked era” feels vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity through subtext and imagery, with strong metaphors like the inkwell as a soul archive; however, emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing, and the ending feels more atmospheric than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on fortune telling, some metaphors (e.g., “vintage finally decanted”) feel overused; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally slips into ornate prose, risking purple tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the inkwell and wine tasting, but overly elaborate style sometimes hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering mood, though not a profound question or thought.</comment>
