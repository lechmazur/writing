<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias Thorn’s grief as a miner is palpable and drives his actions, but his internal conflict lacks deeper nuance beyond the surface loss; motivation is clear but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between visions and technological shifts are intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret society hall and parade’s aftermath create a haunting atmosphere with strong sensory details like confetti as ash; however, the setting’s integration with character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elias’s loss and uses potent imagery like the bell’s resonance, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch; dialogue is purposeful yet Thalia’s tone shifts feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of grief and technology, some metaphors (e.g., “blade sheathed in velvet”) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the bell and after-images, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound one.</comment>
