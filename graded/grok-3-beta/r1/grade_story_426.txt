<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clara’s dual identity as a data analyst and secretive pathfinder is intriguing, and her motivation to preserve folk medicines is clear, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped; the "angrily peaceful" attribute lacks consistent expression in her actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like creaking Ferris wheels, enhancing the eerie tone, though the connection between the setting and the teapot feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its blend of tech and tradition, and imagery like "digitized pollen" is striking, but the emotional impact is muted by overt exposition of Clara’s fury rather than showing it through nuanced action.</comment>
