<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the woodsman’s drive to honor his daughter’s dream, but his personality lacks depth beyond grief; reactions to the hairbrush are poignant yet predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Radio wave garden setting is evocative and unique, enhancing atmosphere with sensory details like static hums, but the water tower’s integration feels slightly utilitarian rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through grief and reconciliation, with strong symbolism in the hairbrush, but dialogue is minimal and subtext, while present, lacks deeper complexity; ending is satisfying yet not unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., “final beep”) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the garden and hairbrush, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not profoundly unique.</comment>
