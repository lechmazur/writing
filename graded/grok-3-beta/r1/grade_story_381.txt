<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems is clear, but the hushed necromancer's personality feels underdeveloped beyond surface quirks like the baseball cap; dialogue with Jarek lacks distinct depth or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the action of dominating the cave's chaos is logical but lacks deeper cause-effect integration with the temporal fractures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like humming stones and luminous quartz, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone; however, the timeframe "between sets" feels underexplored in relation to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through the necromancer's sacrifice and Jarek's ghostly presence; imagery and film references add subtext, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and conflict resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in blending necromancy with futuristic nostalgia, but some metaphors (e.g., "time pooled like mercury") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length works, yet depth is somewhat sacrificed, leaving lingering questions without profound impact.</comment>
