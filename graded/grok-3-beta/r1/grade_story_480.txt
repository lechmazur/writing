<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zara’s role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but her motivation feels surface-level, driven by curiosity without deeper emotional stakes. Her voice is distinct yet lacks nuance in reaction to the surreal events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the receipt and secret club driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between cans of silence and the Crooner’s scream is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall setting effectively enhances the eerie tone, with strong sensory details like mildewed tables and spectral diners, though the secret club feels slightly disconnected from the initial atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and tension through its mystery, with effective imagery like “cans of silence,” but the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution, and dialogue, while purposeful, feels slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is original, and metaphors like “cans of silence” are fresh, but the narrative occasionally leans on predictable ghost story tropes without subversion, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the receipt, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
