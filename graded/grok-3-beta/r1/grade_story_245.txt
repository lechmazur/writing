<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, driven by grief and a desperate need for meaning, but the irate smuggler's personality feels underdeveloped beyond anger and loss; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the chopstick beyond symbolic use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between tea leaf patterns and finding the waterfall is tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered with sensory details like crunching solar panels and ionized fog, enhancing the desolate mood; atmosphere strongly supports the character's isolation, though timeframe integration feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a melancholic response and uses potent imagery (upward waterfall, vibrating chopstick), but the ending feels more poetic than satisfying; subtext of grief is present but not deeply layered; conflict resolution lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Writing avoids clichés and offers a unique blend of sci-fi and emotional rawness; metaphors like "heart’s revolt" are fresh, though some sensory details (bitter tea) are generic; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, but style occasionally veers into ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the chopstick and tea leaves, leaving a lingering sense of loss; however, style sometimes prioritizes imagery over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
