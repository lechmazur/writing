<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s hesitation and awkwardness are evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the transition from doubt to resolve lacks depth, making his actions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear within the word limit, with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the postcard’s role in the resolution feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a striking, immersive setting with vivid sensory details; the atmosphere supports the tone of conflict, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through imagery and theme of restoration, with effective symbolism (postcard, crabs); however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like crabs and vents, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptors (e.g., “ephemeral rancor”) feel ornate and slightly forced; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of reconciliation; however, the style occasionally overreaches with complexity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
