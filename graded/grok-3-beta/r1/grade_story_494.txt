<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arrogance and doubtfully confident nature are evident, shaping his initial brashness, but his transformation feels slightly rushed; motivation to master the final stroke is clear, yet his emotional depth lacks nuance in dialogue and internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from arrogance to revelation is present but feels compressed; the action of singing drives a pivotal moment, though pacing stumbles with the sudden bandit attack, disrupting coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting enhances the atmosphere of introspection and conflict, with evocative moonlight and silence; sensory details are strong, though the timeframe "between breaths" feels underexplored in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (tapestry, song) add depth, and the ending resonates with purpose; however, emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition, and dialogue, while sharp, occasionally feels forced rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "caged storm" are fresh, but some phrases verge on purple prose; the narrative avoids clichés yet lacks a fully distinct voice, with emotional resonance present but not deeply nuanced or surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of song and tapestry; style supports clarity, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting deeper lingering impact.</comment>
