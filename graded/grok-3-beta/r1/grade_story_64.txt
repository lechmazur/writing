<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s uncertainty as an alchemist is evident in her trembling hands and desperate need for approval, but her deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking distinctiveness beyond her motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the verdict as a climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between the scale and the forest trails isn’t fully logical, leaving some cause-effect gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly realized with sensory details like sighing balloons and clattering jars, enhancing the atmosphere of mundane miracles, though the setting’s connection to the forest trails feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about immortality’s cost and uses symbolism with the cracked scale effectively, but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth, and the ending feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining a floating market with mythical elements and avoids overt clichés, though some metaphors (e.g., “sugar in rain”) are familiar, and emotional nuance is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the scale and marketplace, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth, though it does linger with questions about cost and choice.</comment>
