<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits is clear, and the nostalgic tailor’s past grief shapes his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond archetypal sorrow and determination; dialogue and reactions feel somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the mirror’s sudden explosion lacks sufficient buildup, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steampunk observation deck enhances the atmosphere effectively with sensory details like thunder and steam, complementing the tone of hopeful desperation; however, some setting elements feel underutilized in relation to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through themes of loss and hope, with strong imagery like “stitching constellations into coats”; ending is satisfying, but dialogue occasionally feels forced, and subtext is present yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining parallel lives with steampunk, but some metaphors (e.g., “cage of your own making”) are overused; emotional resonance is present but relies at times on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the mirror and parallel lives, leaving a lingering sense of transcendence; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
