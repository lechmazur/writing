<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clara’s portrayal as an underestimated rebel is clear, and her motivation to revive the park aligns with her resilience, but her inner conflict and emotional depth remain surface-level, lacking nuanced exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the Ferris wheel crash, and cause-effect links between despair and supernatural events are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like creaking horses and flickering bulbs, enhancing the ephemeral gloom, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response and uses effective imagery (e.g., “roller coaster’s corpse”), but the central conflict feels resolved too neatly, and subtext about loss and renewal lacks deeper layering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on a haunted park, some metaphors (e.g., “ghosts into guides”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
