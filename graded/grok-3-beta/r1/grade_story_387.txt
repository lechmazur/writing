<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s selflessness as a musician-turned-cartographer is clear, and her motivation to save the whales is consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular drive; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of saving the whales driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the black hole threat lacks sufficient buildup for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting and centuries-long timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like the wind chimes’ hum, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Aria’s sacrifice and uses strong imagery, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict, while present, lacks nuanced resolution; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise with interstellar whales, some metaphors (e.g., “cosmos’ score”) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated sacrifice than nuanced showing; style is distinct but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the vinyl and chimes, leaving a lingering sense of sacrifice, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
