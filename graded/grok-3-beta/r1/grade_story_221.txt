<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation to escape her father’s shadow is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this conflict; her voice, while distinct in moments of reflection, feels underdeveloped in dialogue with the ghost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from discovery to resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between beginning and end is strong, but some cause-effect links (like the amber’s power) are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the melancholic tone and Mara’s motivation; the atmosphere powerfully supports the theme of decay and memory, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through Mara’s thawing heart, with effective symbolism (amber, mayfly) and a satisfying ending; subtext about legacy is present, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict’s resolution could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on grief and legacy, some metaphors (e.g., “drowning places”) feel overused; emotional resonance is achieved through showing rather than telling, but occasional generic descriptors and predictable ghost tropes detract from originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering emotional impact; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice at times.</comment>
