<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing with the disgruntled nature and past scars, but the development feels incomplete; reactions to ghosts lack depth, and the voice, while distinct, borders on melodramatic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure shows a clear arc with the shadow pattern driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like gun oil and bergamot, enhancing the secret agent setting; however, the timeframe's poetic framing feels slightly overwrought and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes curiosity with layered imagery and subtext about scars, but the emotional impact is diluted by an overly cryptic ending and dialogue that feels stilted despite its purposefulness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of shadow patterns and coins as talismans, but some metaphors (e.g., "liberated teeth") feel strained, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style sometimes hinders clarity with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
