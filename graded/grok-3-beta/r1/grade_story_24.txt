<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bard's motivation to stir cold hearts is clear and aligns with his subversive puppet shows, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "ordinarily extraordinary" tag, lacking a distinct voice or deeper personal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the puppet show driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the end—and the connection between sowing stories and the broader impact on the city lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting are vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the fractured idyll tone, though the bar's atmosphere feels less integrated and the warmth concept occasionally overpowers subtler mood-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., dentures humming with revolutionary ghosts) evoke emotion and subtext, but the ending feels slightly pat, and the dockworker’s transformation lacks nuanced showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors like “mountain that ate its echoes” are fresh, the story leans on ornate language bordering on purple prose, and the emotional resonance feels somewhat stated rather than deeply shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the dentures and puppet shows, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with overcomplex phrasing, and the lingering impact feels more intellectual than emotional.</comment>
