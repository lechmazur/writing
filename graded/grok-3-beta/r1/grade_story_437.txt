<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lysander’s spinelessness is evident in his self-loathing and hesitation, but his sudden shift to decisive action feels unconvincing and lacks deeper exploration of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from deception to revelation is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the cause-effect of Lysander’s transformation isn’t fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly rendered with sensory details like hissing rain and jasmine-decay scent, strongly enhancing the doleful tone and character’s despair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (flowers screaming, shattering owl) evoke emotion, but the ending feels more chaotic than satisfying, and the theme of surrender lacks nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the concept of floral language is unique, some metaphors (vines as skeletal fingers) feel overused, and emotional depth relies too much on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
