<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape a dystopian future is clear, but the brewer's personality feels underdeveloped; "detached" is stated but not deeply shown through unique voice or nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of detaching driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the frame and time unravelling are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Abandoned circus tent and transition from analog to digital create a compelling, melancholic atmosphere; sensory details like rotting canvas are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (frame as emptiness, light as escape) are striking but overdone; emotional impact is present but undermined by telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on dystopian tropes without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced; tone shifts slightly, and prose borders on purple at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style occasionally obscures clarity with ornate language; brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice; lingering impact is moderate but not profound.</comment>
