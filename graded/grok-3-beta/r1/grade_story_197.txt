<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between unscrambling notes and the lullaby’s creation lacks clear causality, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Yggdrasil-like tree and the hush after a bedtime story create a vivid, surreal atmosphere with strong sensory details, though the setting’s connection to the fabric scrap feels somewhat forced.</comment>
