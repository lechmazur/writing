<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to correct a mentor’s regret is clear and drives the narrative, but the wandering fireworks designer’s personality lacks depth beyond her profession and quest; her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit; pacing is managed well, though the connection between frost patterns and fireworks feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hidden library in a waterfall is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like bioluminescent fungi and moss-slick stairs, enhancing the ethereal atmosphere and supporting the story’s tone of mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (light as memory, frost as maps) evoke emotional resonance and subtext about closure; the ending is satisfying, though the mentor’s dialogue feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of fireworks as memory is original, some metaphors (e.g., “forgotten promises”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like frost patterns and leaves; it leaves a lingering sense of closure, though style occasionally veers into ornate language that obscures clarity.</comment>
