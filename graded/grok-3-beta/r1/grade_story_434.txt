<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlo's loneliness as a ringleader is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation to guard the artifact is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond bravado, limiting distinct voice and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, conflict, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times; the action of outmaneuvering drives the story, though some cause-effect links (like the flame's power) are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the ghost story booth is evocative with strong sensory details (static hum, peeling foam); tone of playful dread complements the setting, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with imagery (flame dance, napkin constellations) and a satisfying ending, but emotional impact is surface-level; central conflict is clear, though theme of guardianship lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with creative metaphors, but some phrases (e.g., "supernova") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but not nuanced, and the tone occasionally wavers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length works, though depth is sacrificed, leaving only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
