<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped; the assassin’s shift from killer to savior lacks sufficient grounding, and their voice, while distinct, feels overly stylized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the driver’s suicidal intent introduces an abrupt shift that disrupts coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere and complementing the tone of borrowed starlight, though some connections to character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (dawn as knife, camera as ledger) evoke thought, but the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying, and dialogue, while striking, borders on contrived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on purple prose, and the emotional resonance is somewhat undermined by stated rather than shown feelings at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but overly ornate style occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering mood, though not a fully realized depth.</comment>
