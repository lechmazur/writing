<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cryptic medium's portrayal is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to collect creation myths feels clear but lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory, making her actions feel somewhat detached.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the mural discovery driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the double-booking's significance as a plot device is underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cybernetic plant setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like thrumming corridors and wet pigments, enhancing the tone of comforting unease, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
