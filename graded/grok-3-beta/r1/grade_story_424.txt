<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thereseâ€™s zealotry is evident in her obsessive focus on banknotes, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the shift to self-sacrifice lacks deeper grounding in her prior actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the climax; the connection between visualizing wishes and the final sacrifice is logical but not fully fleshed out within the word limit, leaving some cause-effect gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Strange Attractor Laboratory and timeframe of shifting powers create a vivid, immersive backdrop; sensory details like rusted pipes and hissing radiators enhance the rustic refinement tone, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly disconnected from character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its exploration of legacy and sacrifice, with strong imagery like banknotes as fossilized cries; however, the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying, and dialogue lacks depth or distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its concept of visualizing forgotten wishes, with fresh metaphors; yet, some descriptions verge on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about sacrifice; however, the style sometimes overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate at key emotional beats.</comment>
