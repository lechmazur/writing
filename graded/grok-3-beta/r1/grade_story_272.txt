<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clyde’s social awkwardness and cynicism are evident, shaping his interactions and motivations, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; the personal stakes with his father’s message lack nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of decoding regrets driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks clarity in cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The all-night diner setting and late shift timeframe create a fittingly melancholic atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like humming lights; however, the encrypted archive feels underutilized as a setting element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Clyde’s confrontation with regret, and metaphors like the sapling are effective, but the dialogue feels occasionally forced, and the theme of renewal lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding regrets is original, some metaphors (e.g., “twin engines”) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies too much on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the whistle and regrets, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
