<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marnie’s motivation as a conspiracy theorist is clear and drives her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of breaking the curse driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks full coherence with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The magnetic anomaly setting and eerie atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like the hum and charged air, enhancing the mood, though the connection between setting and object feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of generational curses and magnetic anomalies offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “heat over asphalt”) are generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated stakes than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the handkerchief and anomaly, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
