<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's fanatical nature as a puzzle maker is evident, and motivation to track spiritual decay is intriguing, but the depth of personality and voice feels underdeveloped within the word limit; reactions to the string and letters reveal guilt, yet lack nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, driven by the string and letters, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional beats; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links between past actions and present revelations are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse on a rocky island is vividly rendered with sensory details like salt-thick fog and crashing waves, enhancing the mood of isolation; atmosphere supports the weight of secrets, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a melancholic response with subtext about guilt and confession; imagery and symbolism (lighthouse beam, string as cipher) are effective, but ending feels slightly predictable; central conflict of buried truth is clear but lacks deeper thematic exploration within constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with evocative metaphors, but some phrases like "lethargic excitement" feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is present but relies on stated feelings over nuanced showing; narrative avoids clich√©s yet lacks a truly surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative; style supports clarity, but brief length exposes underdeveloped emotional depth; creative thinking is evident in puzzle-solving mechanism, though impact beyond surface narrative is limited.</comment>
