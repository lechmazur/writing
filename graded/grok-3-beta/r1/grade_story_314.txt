<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s overworked nature as a policy enforcer is clear, and her motivation to confront grief ties to her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond exhaustion and regret; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the supernatural encounter driving change, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the bread box’s role, are vague or forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kelp forest setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the supernatural tone, but the connection between the bread box and the environment feels tenuous, slightly undermining atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mira’s grief and uses imagery effectively, but the ending feels slightly abrupt; subtext about work as avoidance is present but not fully layered, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the supernatural kelp forest ghost offers some originality, the grief-driven transformation trope is familiar without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but sometimes overdone, and emotional nuance is present yet not deeply unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering feeling of release, though not profoundly memorable.</comment>
