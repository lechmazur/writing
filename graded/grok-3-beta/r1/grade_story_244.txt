<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swordswoman’s guilt as a driving force is clear and shapes her reservedly bold nature, but her inner conflict lacks deeper exploration due to the word limit; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from pursuit to the door’s opening is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between historians’ secrets and the door’s appearance are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop and alley create a vivid, moody atmosphere with strong sensory details like ozone and flickering light, enhancing the mellow intensity; however, the rosebush’s timeframe feels underexplored in the setting’s context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (rosebush, mask) and imagery evokes thought, with a lingering ending; yet, the central conflict of guilt feels more told than shown, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers some originality in combining elements like the mask and door, with fresh metaphors, but it leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration and a lingering question of absolution, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; the brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
