<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character as a professional scapegoat is intriguing and shapes motivation, but development feels surface-level; internal conflict and voice lack depth for a first-person narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the washer's transformation driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (e.g., reactor revelation) are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cloud City setting is evocative with strong sensory details like smog and steel, enhancing atmosphere, though integration with timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through themes of identity and blame, with effective symbolism (washer as key), but emotional resonance is limited by telling over showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original concept of scapegoat and washer-as-key shows ingenuity, but some metaphors (e.g., "forgotten prayers") feel overused, and emotional nuance is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering question about systems of blame, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
