<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>General Veyra's burnt-out nature is evident, but his motivation to dethrone fear feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in personal stakes; his voice is distinct yet reactions sometimes feel performative rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from despair to renewal is present but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between actions and outcomes are logical, though pacing stumbles with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dark matter diner setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; it strongly supports the tone of mischievous wisdom, though timeframe integration feels slightly vague.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
