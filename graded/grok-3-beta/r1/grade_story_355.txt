<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The psychedelic art installation is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the forgotten revelry tone and supporting Lysandra’s motivation; however, the timeframe’s specificity feels underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy; however, the style’s complexity sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
