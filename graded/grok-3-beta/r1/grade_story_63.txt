<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysandra’s reserved nature as an oracle is evident, and her motivation to preserve art is clear, but her internal conflict of pride and humility feels underexplored, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with mending driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized with sensory details like humming orbs and choir voices, enhancing atmosphere, though the setting’s connection to the timeframe feels slightly incidental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought, but uneven depth and style choices slightly hinder clarity and impact for top-tier publication.</comment>
