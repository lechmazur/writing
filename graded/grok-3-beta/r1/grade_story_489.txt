<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, and her spectral nature ties to her lingering duty, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "aggressive kindness" relic, which feels underexplored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the whistle's journey tying beginning to end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the whale's call as a method lacks clear causal impact on the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly rendered with sensory details like "salt-stained silence," enhancing the eerie tone and supporting the observer's motivation, though the dancer's stage setting feels disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on tradition as a current, with strong imagery like the whale's song stitching moments, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and dialogue from ancestors lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of spectral and natural elements, some metaphors like "tradition is a seed" feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated connections than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the whistle and whale's call, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
