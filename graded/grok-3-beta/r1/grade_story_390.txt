<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crane’s calm demeanor as an assassin is well-portrayed and consistent, shaping his unflappable responses, but his deeper motivations remain somewhat opaque beyond the mission, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot is driven by the amalgamation of poison with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the prophecy’s role as an ingredient list lacks full integration into the narrative’s logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like lotus soup and moonlit windowsills, enhancing the atmosphere of unease, though the timeframe’s impact feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext (butterfly as doom) create impact, and dialogue is sharp, but emotional resonance is undercut by surface-level sentimentality in the flowers’ whispers; the ending satisfies but lacks profound lingering effect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of whispering petals and venomous butterflies is inventive, some metaphors (e.g., “Rorschach blot of doom”) feel slightly overused, and emotional handling occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the botanical press, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
