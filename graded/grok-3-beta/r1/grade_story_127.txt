<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation to offer peace is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the creative block and guilt; his voice feels indistinct despite the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between memory and resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is vividly realized with sensory details like brass gears and steam, enhancing the mood of desperation, though the underwater memory feels slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elias’s requiem and Mara’s return, with strong imagery, but the dialogue is too sparse to feel natural, and the theme of trust feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the steampunk setting and gauntlet imagery show originality, some metaphors (coral reef texture) feel forced, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting deeper exploration of trust and reconciliation.</comment>
