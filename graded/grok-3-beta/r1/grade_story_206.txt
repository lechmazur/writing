<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marisol’s vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are well-integrated into her actions, but her deeper emotional layers and voice feel underdeveloped, lacking nuanced internal conflict beyond revenge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end, driven by the counterattack, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting and rebellion timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like sugar-dusted boxes and syrup cathedrals, enhancing the tone of ardent scorn effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolism (sugar as weapon, cathedral collapse) evoke emotion and subtext about art and loss, though the ending feels slightly abrupt, missing a fully satisfying emotional closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers originality in combining candy sculpting with rebellion, some metaphors (e.g., “bitterness cloyed her tongue”) feel overused, and emotional depth occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering bittersweet tone, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and emotional depth.</comment>
