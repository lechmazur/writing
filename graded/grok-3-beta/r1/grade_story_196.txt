<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s motivation to escape his past and keep a hidden promise is clear, but his fiercely apathetic attribute feels inconsistently portrayed, wavering between detachment and emotional vulnerability without sufficient depth in such a short piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of overcoming tied to following meteor showers, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a stronger emotional thread to fully cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery setting is vividly realized with evocative imagery of stars and meteors, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation, though sensory details are unevenly distributed, and the breakroom scene feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through the swordsman’s journey and the symbolism of the top, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch; subtext is present but not fully layered, and the central conflict feels resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and introspection, some metaphors (e.g., meteors mirroring scars) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is attempted but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the meteor showers and monastery, leaving a lingering sense of renewal, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped emotional stakes, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
