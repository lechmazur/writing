<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo’s motivation to understand and liberate ghosts is clear, and his “elegantly clumsy” attribute shapes small, endearing actions like fumbling his thermos. However, his deeper personality and voice feel underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking nuanced dialogue or internal conflict to fully flesh out his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning (Milo’s stakeout), middle (ghost encounter), and end (resolution via letting go), but pacing feels rushed, especially in the emotional climax. The action of dissecting ghost motivations drives the story, yet cause-effect links, like why the crown triggers liberation, are vague and underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is evocative, paired well with the drowned carnival backstory, and enhances the ghostly atmosphere through sensory details like “brittle whisper of sea air.” However, the timeframe of lunch breaks feels incidental, and the setting’s connection to Milo’s motivation could be more deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses effective imagery (petals as sea glass, crown disintegrating into mist), with subtext about memory and release. Yet, the ending feels slightly abrupt, lacking a stronger emotional punch, and the central conflict of liberation is resolved too quickly to resonate fully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of ghostly and mechanical elements, some metaphors (e.g., “fracture in the air”) feel slightly overused. Emotional resonance is present but leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing. The tone is consistent, but the narrative risks predictability in ghost-liberation tropes without enough subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the flower crown and silence, and the brief length seems deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering thought about letting go, but lacks the depth for a truly profound impact.</comment>
