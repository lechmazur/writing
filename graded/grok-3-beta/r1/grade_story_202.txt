<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation as a careful poisoner and her innocently guilty nature are intriguing, but her personality lacks depth beyond the plot’s demands; her voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the scavenger hunt and authentication action, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the emotional climax, missing deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The found object museum setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like “dusty starlight” and “cracked skylights,” enhancing the tone and atmosphere, though the skateboarding timeframe feels slightly underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
