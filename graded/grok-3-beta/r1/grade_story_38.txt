<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the insomniac poet's personality is shaped by her environment and actions, but her motivations feel slightly vague beyond reacting to the ghost, missing a deeper personal stake or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the resolution of replanting feels rushed, and the connection between subway stops and the main conflict isn’t fully integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway stops create a vivid, moody atmosphere with strong sensory details like soil and jasmine, effectively supporting the tone of loss and renewal, though the timeframe’s role feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a quiet emotional response through imagery and subtext of grief and forgiveness, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue is sparse and lacks punch; the theme of non-violence is present but not sharply focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is mixed; metaphors like “refugee camp” are fresh, but some imagery (ivy strangling typewriter) feels trope-heavy without subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like botanical samples, leaving a lingering sense of quiet renewal, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped character depth hinder its readiness for top-tier publication.</comment>
