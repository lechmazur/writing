<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exiled prince's motivation to cure loneliness is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond archetypal brooding; his reaction to the mortar reveals grief, yet his voice remains indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of improving fortunes driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between memories and the mortar's power are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of isolation; sensory details like crunching frost and silver dust motes are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the prince's grief and the woman's arrival, with strong imagery and symbolism in the mortar as a crucible; however, the ending feels slightly pat, and dialogue lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors like "gnawed like winter wind" are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar exile and redemption tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mortar, and the brief length suits the introspective tone; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and depth beyond the narrative is limited.</comment>
