<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jessa’s fierce loyalty as a scout is evident, but her internal conflict and motivation lack deeper exploration within the word limit; her voice is distinct yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the blackout driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between radicalization and comedic routines is intriguing yet underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid, eerie atmosphere of sanctified dread; sensory details like creaking frames and moth wings enhance immersion, though smell and taste are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (moths, journal) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by limited character depth; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original elements like coded comedy routines stand out, but some metaphors (e.g., “storm inside her skull”) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length limits depth; it leaves a lingering tension, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
