<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jessa’s feistiness and intellectual playfulness are evident in her dialogue and actions, but her deeper motivations and backstory feel underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the morphing action driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links (like the rover’s transformation) strain logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The space debris art studio is vividly rendered with evocative imagery, enhancing the atmosphere, though sensory details are unevenly distributed, and the setting’s connection to character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Jessa’s triumph, with some effective symbolism (lamp as knowledge), but dialogue feels occasionally stilted, and subtext is present yet not fully layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and ancient craft, it leans on familiar “relic with hidden power” tropes without fully subverting them; metaphors are fresh in places but generic elsewhere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth; it leaves a lingering idea of preservation but lacks profound impact.</comment>
