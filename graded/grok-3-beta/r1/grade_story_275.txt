<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious nature and rebellious streak are evident, but his deeper motivations remain somewhat opaque, lacking nuanced emotional depth beyond the surface goal of coaxing life from barren ground.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of translating the comet’s song driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on imagery, while key developments feel rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a vivid, haunting atmosphere, with strong sensory details like "brittle soil" and "crimson tail," effectively supporting the tone of deliberate wilderness and the hermit's mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of quiet defiance and hope through imagery and symbolism (e.g., the weathervane’s arc), but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; the theme of equilibrium feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors (e.g., "wound" for the comet) feel slightly overused, and the hermit's stoic reasoning lacks human nuance, occasionally hinting at formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements like the pressed flower album, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
