<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around hushing envy is intriguing but underdeveloped; the watchman’s confidence feels stated rather than shown through decisive actions, and his internal conflict lacks depth in dialogue or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between fingerprint analysis and hive mobilization is logical yet underexplored, leaving the climax slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beehive setting is vividly realized with sensory details like humming walls and waxen floors, enhancing the atmosphere of yearning and remorse; tone complements the concept well, though some setting-action links feel superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through themes of envy and belonging, with strong imagery like the cracked ruler as a symbol of fracture; however, emotional resonance is diminished by telling over showing, and the ending feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in the beehive metaphor and thematic depth, but some metaphors (e.g., envy’s whispers) verge on cliché without subversion; emotional handling is nuanced at times but occasionally stated directly, lacking consistent subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering theme of absolution; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate in exploring character depth.</comment>
