<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kai's aloofness as an orphan is evident, and their motivation to transform fear into courage is clear, but their emotional depth feels underdeveloped; reactions to the stones and anomaly lack nuanced introspection, making their voice somewhat indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the anomaly’s resolution, and the action of loosening drives tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the stones and anomaly are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like floating boxes and trembling workbenches, enhancing the mood of detachment, though the connection to the timeframe of garage cleaning feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Kai’s quiet rebellion, with strong imagery and symbolism in the stones and anomaly, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the central theme of adaptation lacks deeper subtext or reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the anomaly offers an original premise, some metaphors (e.g., “courage felt like a stranger’s coat”) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, leaving a lingering question of Kai’s future, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
