<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marisol's eccentricity as a cartographer shapes her unique approach to leadership and strategy, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper emotional nuance beyond tactical cunning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the sudden revolt, lack sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panels create a striking, cohesive setting that enhances the story's tension, with vivid imagery like "accusatory fingers" of shadow; however, sensory details beyond sight are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet tone and uses strong metaphors like pruning as leadership, but the ending feels abrupt, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like solar panels and secret handshakes, but some metaphors (e.g., "steel wrapped in honey") feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to underdeveloped emotional resonance.</comment>
