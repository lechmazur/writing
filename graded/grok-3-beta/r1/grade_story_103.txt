<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sir Gareth’s weathered nature and tragic past shape his actions, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped due to the brevity; his distinct voice emerges in dialogue, though deeper internal conflict could elevate the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and cohesive within the word limit, with a logical progression from vow to sacrifice, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat for emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and storm-laden atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like rotting lilies and salt-crusted hinges, powerfully enhancing the mood and supporting Gareth’s motivation, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through Gareth’s sacrifice and uses potent imagery and symbolism (mirrors, relics), with a satisfying ending; however, the central theme of regret could be layered with more subtext for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on impossible choices, some metaphors (e.g., “skeletal hand”) feel familiar, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on explicit statement over nuanced showing, slightly diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering melancholic impression; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity at key moments.</comment>
