<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The exorcist’s rattled nature and inwardly social trait are evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped beyond past failure; reactions to the postcard are intriguing yet lack deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with puzzles driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility enhances the eerie tone with vivid sensory details like ozone and humming machines; atmosphere supports the concept well, though dance lessons feel slightly disconnected from the setting’s core mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and tension with strong imagery and subtext about science versus wonder, but the ending feels slightly unsatisfying; dialogue is sharp yet sparse, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of science and supernatural, some metaphors (e.g., “silk-wrapped steel”) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced showing over stating; tone is consistent but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like puzzles and postcards, leaving a lingering question about wonder; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
