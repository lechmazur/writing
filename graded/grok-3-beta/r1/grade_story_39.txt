<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlo’s restlessness as a tailor is hinted at through his dual life, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the immediate plot; reactions to the lantern are intriguing but not fully revealing of a nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of reverberation ties into the tension well, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The biodome on Mars is vividly rendered with sensory details like the crimson sky and seismic hum, enhancing the atmosphere of cautious abandon, though the bookshop setting feels underexplored in relation to the broader world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and some reflection on endurance, with strong imagery like the lantern’s glow, but the ending feels abrupt, and dialogue lacks natural flow; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and mystery, some metaphors (e.g., “phantom warmth”) feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated stakes than nuanced showing; tone is mostly consistent but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the lantern and biodome, leaving a lingering sense of sacrifice, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
