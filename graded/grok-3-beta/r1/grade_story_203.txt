<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exorcist’s stage fright is an intriguing trait, but its integration into their personality and actions feels underdeveloped; it’s mentioned but doesn’t consistently drive behavior or conflict beyond a surface level. Motivation is somewhat clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—rushed in emotional beats and overly dense in imagery. Cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting and toy assembly timeframe are vividly rendered with strong sensory details (e.g., celestial graveyard, whir of drones), enhancing atmosphere. However, the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through layered imagery and subtext (e.g., lies as inheritance), and the ending is purposeful. However, the central conflict feels slightly overwrought for the word limit, and dialogue, while striking, borders on melodramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of sci-fi and supernatural, some metaphors (e.g., “ink in water”) feel overused, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on telling rather than showing. Tone is consistent but not always nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite multiple elements, with creative integration of themes like inheritance and possibility. However, the style sometimes overreaches with dense prose, hindering clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
