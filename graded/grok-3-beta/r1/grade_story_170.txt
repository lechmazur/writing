<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marisela’s motivation to restore the coral and honor her grandmother’s legacy is clear, and her academically artistic trait shapes her unique approach to science and beauty. However, her inner conflict and voice could be more distinct; the emotional depth feels slightly surface-level despite the evocative context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning (laying the stone), middle (grappling with doubt), and resolution (polyp growth). Pacing is managed well, but the connection between actions and outcomes feels slightly rushed, lacking deeper causal exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The coral restoration station setting is vividly realized with sensory details (salt-crusted iron, brine-scorched wind) that enhance the atmosphere of loss and hope. The tone of breathless longing aligns with the setting, though some sensory elements could be more uniquely tied to Marisela’s perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through imagery and symbolism (sewing kit as legacy, coral as rebirth), with a satisfying ending. Subtext about doubt and resilience is present, but the central conflict of shame versus purpose could be sharper; some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on environmental restoration and personal doubt, some metaphors (e.g., “bleached white as bone”) feel familiar. Emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated directly rather than shown, and the style, though poetic, borders on ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a lingering sense of hope and renewal, and the elements are generally in service of the narrative. The style supports the mood but occasionally overreaches with complexity, slightly hindering clarity. Creative thinking is evident, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
