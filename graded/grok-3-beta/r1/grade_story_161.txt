<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal tragedy is clear, but the vigilant orchardist’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond sardonic glee; her voice, though distinct, lacks depth in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but rushed at the end; connections between conspiracy and personal loss are intriguing but lack logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting of the paper airplane facility is unique and ties to the action, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance the sardonic tone or conspiracy theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (grief as a lens, apple roots cracking concrete) and a memorable ending, but emotional resonance is stated more than shown; central conflict is clear yet resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original in combining orchardist and conspiracy elements, with fresh metaphors, but some phrases (e.g., “conspiracies wearing gloves”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; story length feels constrained rather than deliberate, limiting depth.</comment>
