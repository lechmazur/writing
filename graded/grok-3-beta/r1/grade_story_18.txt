<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Veridian’s telepathic ability and tragic joy are well-integrated into his motivations, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; the girl’s characterization lacks distinctiveness despite her pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the storm metaphor and the purge reveal is slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly realized with strong sensory details (hissing, trembling cobblestones), enhancing the gloomy yet defiant tone, though the timeframe’s impact on atmosphere is underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Veridian’s loss and resolve, with effective imagery (ink as starlight), but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the theme of truth lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a living statue and steam-punk setting offers originality, some metaphors (truth as smoke) are overused, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like calligraphy and telepathy, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth; it leaves a lingering feeling, though not profoundly.</comment>
