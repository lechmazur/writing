<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the search for the goddess’s echo, but pacing feels rushed at times, and some surreal elements disrupt coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a repurposed highway overpass is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the chaotic tone and supporting the story’s atmosphere, though the timeframe’s impact feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
