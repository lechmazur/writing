<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve building traditions is clear and drives the sincere rebel’s actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the emotional confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between shared secrets and house stabilization is intriguing yet underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with sensory details like damp stone and trembling plaster, enhancing the haunted setting; tone of bitterness aligns well with the concept, though setting-timeframe synergy feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., fractured time, house’s heartbeat) evoke thought, and the ending is satisfying; however, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh (e.g., sky as held breath), but others feel overused (e.g., house as alive); emotional handling shows nuance in confession, yet overall style borders on ornate, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of truce; however, style occasionally hinders clarity with dense phrasing, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
