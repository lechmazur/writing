<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s role as a dream interpreter shapes her unique perspective, but her motivation to rewrite laws feels slightly disconnected from her profession; it lacks deeper personal stakes or nuance in her internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with impersonation driving the action logically, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks depth, leaving some cause-effect links underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility is vividly realized with sensory details like steaming vents and humming pulses, enhancing the peculiar tone, though the connection between setting and timeframe (“during baking”) feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its rebellion theme and symbolic Pulse, but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; imagery is strong, yet the ending feels more functional than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of the Quiet Pulse and dream interpretation offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “baking compliance”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is diminished by surface-level resolution.</comment>
