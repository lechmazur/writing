<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thalia’s portrayal as a vague mystic is intriguing, but her motivations lack depth; chronicling family histories feels stated rather than felt, and her recklessness overshadows nuanced personality development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action of overriding the system, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the compass triggering coordinates, are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthetic biology lab setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like humming machines and cracked windows, enhancing the hollow tone, though the timeframe of the last star map feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with its blend of science and mysticism, and imagery like “horizons that bloomed from rot” is striking, but the emotional impact is muted by limited character depth; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of DNA-encoded narratives is original, some metaphors like “wind through shipwrecks” feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the compass and lab, leaving a lingering sense of mystery, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
