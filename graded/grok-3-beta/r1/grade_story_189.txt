<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode star maps is clear, and the "uniquely literal" trait shapes her approach, but her personality lacks depth or distinct voice beyond this trait; reactions feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, driven by decoding and overcharging actions, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with abrupt drone ship introduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse basement and post-water-war timeframe create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere with strong sensory details (saltwater, groans), enhancing the tone and motivation, though object-setting connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes tension and thought through its themes of survival and misuse of knowledge, with striking imagery (starfield projections), but lacks emotional depth in character reactions and a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining star maps and a phone booth key as cipher, with fresh metaphors, but reliance on post-apocalyptic tropes and somewhat generic emotional descriptors dampen uniqueness; tone is consistent but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering question about survival, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and brevity sometimes limits depth rather than enhancing it.</comment>
