<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elara's sincerity as a rebel is stated but lacks depth; her motivation to preserve traditions feels generic and underexplored, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the sticky note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a basic arc but feels repetitive and lacks momentum; the action of theorizing is underdeveloped, and pacing is uneven within the word limit, with no significant progression or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The haunted passage and storm timeframe create a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and predictable; the setting supports the tone but doesn't deeply enhance character motivation or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story fails to evoke strong emotion or thought; imagery and symbolism (e.g., sticky note) are present but shallow, with no subtext or memorable impact; conflict is vague and unresolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on clich√©s of haunted passages and ancestral traditions without subversion; language is overly ornate at times, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story feels fragmented despite assigned elements; style is inconsistent, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; lacks lingering depth or creative integration of elements.</comment>
