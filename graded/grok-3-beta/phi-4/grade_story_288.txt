<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eliot's "professionally wild" trait feels mentioned rather than embodied, and his motivation lacks depth beyond a generic desire to create art. No distinct voice emerges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the quarantine action drives little narrative tension, and pacing feels rushed with an abrupt shift to resolution. The arc exists but lacks a compelling middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are underdeveloped; the ozone monitoring station feels like a backdrop rather than an integrated element, and sensory details are sparse and generic, failing to immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is weak; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and literary devices like the flag's symbolism feel heavy-handed. The ending lacks punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from clich√©d themes of hope and freedom without fresh perspective; language is formulaic with predictable descriptors, lacking nuanced emotion or unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is lacking; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the story's brevity seems a limitation rather than a strength. Little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
