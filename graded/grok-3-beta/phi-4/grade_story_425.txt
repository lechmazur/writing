<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eamon's moroseness and paladin nature are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to restore systems feels generic, lacking personal stakes or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks tension; the action of restoring systems drives the story, but the blackout and resolution feel predictable and rushed within the word limit, missing a compelling arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The solar flare observatory setting is intriguing and fits the timeframe, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the tone of bored excitement or Eamon's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or memorable impact; while the ending is purposeful, there's little subtext or literary device usage, and the central conflict feels understated and resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes of a lone hero restoring a forgotten place; language is occasionally ornate without purpose, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but not in a way that elevates the narrative, and the style lacks clarity or depth to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
