<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's vigilance and punctuality are mentioned but not deeply integrated into her actions or motivations. Her tragedy feels like a plot device rather than a lived experience, lacking emotional depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the conspiracy unraveling drives the story, but the connection between the paper airplane facility and the seal's mystery feels forced. Pacing is rushed at the end, undermining the resolution's impact within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The setting of a paper airplane test facility is intriguing but underutilized; it lacks sensory detail and fails to meaningfully connect to the antique seal or enhance the atmosphere. Tone of sardonic glee feels inconsistent with the tragedy motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; the ending feels predictable rather than satisfying. Literary devices like the peacock pattern are symbolic but not impactful. Conflict resolution is too neat and lacks tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable conspiracy tropes without subversion. Emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance. The narrative feels formulaic, with no distinct authorial style or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. Style lacks clarity and depth, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice. Little lingering impact or creative spark.</comment>
