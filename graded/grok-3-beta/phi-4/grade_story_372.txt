<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Alex's "lovelorn" nature and "curiously indifferent" attribute are mentioned but not deeply explored or integrated into his actions or motivations. His reactions lack depth, and his voice feels generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the avalanche as a climactic event feels abrupt and disconnected from earlier elements like the sticky label or new recipe. Pacing is rushed, and the resolution lacks a strong arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The futuristic city slums are vividly described with neon lights and decay, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to character motivation or the concept of unfamiliar reflections feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and literary devices like metaphors are clich√©d ("neon lights flickered like dying stars"). The ending feels forced, lacking subtext or deeper meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from reliance on predictable tropes (spy in a dystopian city, last-second escape). Language is occasionally ornate without purpose, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling formulaic and surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. The style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice. Lacks lingering impact.</comment>
