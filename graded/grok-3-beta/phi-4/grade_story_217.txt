<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eli's "underestimated rebel" trait feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or backstory. Motivation is clear but lacks depth, and dialogue is functional but lacks a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but predictable, with a rushed resolution. The action of intensifying resolve is present but not compellingly integrated, and pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is adequately built with the haunted amusement park setting, and some sensory details (aroma of spices) stand out, but the tone of ephemeral gloom feels repetitive and underutilized in enhancing character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or memorable impact; it relies on telling rather than showing emotions. The ending is purposeful but not satisfying, and there’s little subtext or thematic resonance beyond the surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by clichéd tropes (haunted house awakening wonder) without subversion. Writing feels formulaic at times, with generic descriptors and stated emotions lacking nuance or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels forced around assigned elements rather than cohesive. Style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
