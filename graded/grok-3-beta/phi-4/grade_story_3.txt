<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the surly watchman’s personality lacks depth beyond the assigned trait, and his motivation to understand cosmic patterns feels vague and unsupported by distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is repetitive and lacks a clear arc; the unraveling of yarn as a central action feels static and fails to build tension or resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than integral, and the style lacks clarity or lasting impact, making the short length seem like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
