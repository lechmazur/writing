<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The composer's sound garden is evocatively described with sensory details like rustling leaves and humming approval, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the timeframe "between lectures" feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with cosmic dance and legacy themes, and imagery is strong, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in combining elements, but cohesion suffers from underdeveloped connections; style is overly elaborate at times, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
