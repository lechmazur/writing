<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the cartographer's perceptiveness is stated but not deeply explored through actions or nuanced dialogue, and the boy's transformation feels abrupt and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a strong arc; the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, and pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional shifts within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details like the forge's clang, but the futuristic hospital ward feels underutilized and disconnected from the nostalgic tone and dragonfly imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the dragonfly, but emotional resonance is undermined by telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable emotional beats and generic metaphors; the narrative lacks a distinct voice and shows signs of formulaic progression without fresh subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the story lacks depth or a lingering impact despite some creative intent.</comment>
