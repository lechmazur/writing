<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the desire to revive the oracle's voice, but the sorrowful apothecary lacks depth and distinct voice; her personality feels generic and reactions to the plastic spoon are symbolic but not revealing of nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of decoding dream catchers feels forced and lacks logical grounding; pacing is rushed, and coherence suffers from abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The exiled fortress and desert setting create an intriguing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and plastic spoon feels contrived rather than meaningful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional impact with painful joy, but it relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the spoon is heavy-handed, and the ending feels predictable rather than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but it leans on clichéd emotional descriptors and generic imagery; tone shifts unnaturally, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than evoked.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion among disparate elements; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and while there’s some creative intent, it lacks depth or lingering impact.</comment>
