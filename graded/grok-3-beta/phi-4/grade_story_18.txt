<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to find truth is clear but lacks depth; the telepathic ability shapes actions minimally, and the tragically joyful attribute feels surface-level without nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional beats, and the connection between beginning and end is weak despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Steam-powered city square is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the character's motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance but relies on telling over showing; imagery like calligraphy is forced, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and overused metaphors like "beacon of hope"; lacks originality and shows little subversion of predictable tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story lacks cohesion; elements feel forced rather than organic, and the short length exposes shallow depth without leaving a lasting impression or question.</comment>
