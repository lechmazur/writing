<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, but Elara's "blunt heretic" trait feels underdeveloped and lacks impact on her actions or voice; the teddy bear's symbolism is forced and doesn't deeply reveal her personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the stock ticker method is intriguing but poorly integrated, lacking logical grounding in the narrative's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting of the forgotten library is evocative with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of anxious elation; connection between setting and teddy bear feels superficial.</comment>
