<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to spark flames in a land of ice is clear, but Sir Alaric's personality lacks depth beyond earnestness; his actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than distinct traits or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc, but the connection between mapping tears and triggering change is tenuous and lacks logical grounding; pacing feels rushed at the end with unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the arid desert and ruined aqueduct is evocative and supports the nostalgic tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the greenhouse feels disconnected from the broader atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with stars and maps, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; ending lacks a strong punch, feeling more contemplative than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d knightly tropes and predictable quest narrative without subversion; metaphors like "canvas of life" are overused and lack freshness; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with some cohesion, but feels forced around them rather than organic; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering depth or question for the reader.</comment>
