<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; connection between beginning and end is tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution; daydream loops as a method lack clear impact on plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the deserted playground is evocative and ties to the mood of solitude, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere supports the concept of unwanted gifts, though wilderness edge feels underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but metaphors like “time’s unraveling tapestry” feel overwrought; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
