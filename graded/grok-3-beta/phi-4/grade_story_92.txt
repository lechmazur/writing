<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Alex's role as a dog walker for the ultra-rich feels incidental rather than integral to his personality or motivations, and his reactions lack depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is weak with no clear arc or resolution; the story meanders without a strong connection between beginning and end, and pacing feels uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted mansion dining room setting and the timeframe create a compelling atmosphere with evocative imagery, but sensory details are sparse and inconsistently applied to enhance mood or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or memorable subtext; while imagery is present, the narrative feels surface-level with an unsatisfying ending and no clear central conflict or theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The story leans on clich√©s of haunted mansions and mysterious flora without subversion; writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors and lacks originality or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story lacks cohesion despite incorporating assigned elements; the style is unclear, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, with little lingering impact.</comment>
