<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the tired swordsman’s apathy and defiance feel stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between following meteor showers and overcoming apathy feels underdeveloped and somewhat arbitrary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery setting is evocative and complements the tone of solitude, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with the swordsman’s journey, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery like meteor showers is symbolic but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of following meteors is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of redemption without fresh subversion; emotional portrayal feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but lacks the depth or lingering impact needed for a top-tier publication; style is clear but unremarkable.</comment>
