<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lila's carefree nature is evident, but her motivation to collect sacred practices feels vague and underdeveloped, lacking depth in how it drives her actions beyond the dance metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or conflict; while the dance metaphor ties the beginning to the end, the story feels repetitive and meanders without clear progression or tension within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the setting is unique, the narrative relies on predictable patterns of whimsy and lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, feeling somewhat formulaic despite creative elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the repetitive focus on the dance metaphor and lack of deeper conflict make it feel limited rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
