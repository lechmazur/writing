<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the knight's "grudgingly sweet" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistently reflected in actions or voice, missing a distinct personality beyond generic regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure shows a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the knight's internal journey and external actions is somewhat vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is vividly described and enhances the tone of joyful agony, with strong sensory details of the sea and reef; however, the mirrored reflection timeframe feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through symbolism of the lighthouse and items, but the impact is diluted by overt telling of emotions rather than showing; the theme of transformation is clear but lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion; metaphors like "walls around his heart" feel generic, and emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, lacking a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the lighthouse and items, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, missing a lingering depth.</comment>
