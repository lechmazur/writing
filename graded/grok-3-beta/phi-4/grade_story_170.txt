<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the connection between memorizing letters and resolving shame feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coral restoration station setting is evocative with sensory details like ocean whispers, but its connection to the sewing kit and doubt feels superficial; atmosphere supports longing but not consistently.</comment>
