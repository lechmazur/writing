<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as a professional cuddler is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to overcome prejudice feels vague and lacks specific grounding in her actions or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the chance encounter and the hangar resolution feels tenuous; pacing is uneven with rushed internal shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is evocative and ties to the tone of decay, but sensory details are generic (e.g., "scent of decay") and fail to fully immerse; atmosphere supports the theme only superficially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through symbolism (ticket punch, hangar), but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler is unique, the narrative leans on clich√©d metaphors (e.g., "ghosts of journeys past") and lacks fresh emotional nuance; writing feels formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style lacks distinctiveness; it neither hinders nor elevates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
