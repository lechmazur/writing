<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to challenge the status quo is stated but lacks depth or specificity; Eli's transformation feels abrupt and unearned, with little insight into his inner conflict or past as a pickpocket.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced; the connection between poetry and transformation is tenuous, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution lacking causal depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting of the haunted lighthouse engine room is evocative and supports the eerie tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the dummy and transformation but lacks emotional resonance; ending feels predictable, and poetry as a device is underdeveloped with no memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d tropes of haunted settings and magical transformation without subversion; language is occasionally ornate ("scorching poise") and lacks a distinct, authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but feels constructed around them rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or a cohesive style, with creative potential undermined by superficial execution.</comment>
