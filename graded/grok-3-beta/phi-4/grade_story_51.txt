<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to seek resilience is clear, but his portrayal as an apologetic thug lacks depth; the attribute of being rationally subjective feels underexplored and does not distinctly shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the method of staging accidental meetings feels contrived and weakly connected to the action of outlasting; pacing is uneven with a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is intriguing but underdeveloped; sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the character's motivation or the object feels superficial rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; the ending feels predictable, and literary devices like symbolism are minimal and lack impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative leans on clich√©d themes of redemption without fresh perspective; emotional descriptions are stated rather than nuanced, and the writing lacks a distinct style, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>While the story incorporates assigned elements, it lacks cohesion and creative depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, and it fails to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
