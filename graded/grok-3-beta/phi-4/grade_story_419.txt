<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's "no-nonsense empathic" nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict, and her motivation feels generic rather than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks depth; the action of mollifying spirits drives the story, but the arc feels predictable and the pacing rushed, missing a stronger middle conflict within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is evocative and complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and failing to fully enhance the action or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is underwhelming; while the stained glass ornament as a symbol of tradition offers some subtext, emotional resonance is weak, and the writing relies on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Originality is lacking; the narrative leans on familiar ghost story tropes without subversion, and the language, while clear, feels formulaic with generic descriptors instead of fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are incorporated but not in a way that feels innovative or emotionally compelling, leaving little lasting impact.</comment>
