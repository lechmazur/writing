<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eli's aloofness as an orphan is mentioned but not deeply explored; his motivation to transform fear into courage feels surface-level and lacks nuanced development within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the anomaly and message driving change, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between the anomaly and Eli’s transformation are vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly as a setting is intriguing and ties to the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere’s connection to Eli’s motivation feels more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with Eli’s fear-to-courage shift, but it leans on telling over showing; symbolism of stones is present but not striking or deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the anomaly offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable transformation tropes without subversion; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, lacking a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering depth or question, settling for a straightforward resolution.</comment>
