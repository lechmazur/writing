<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the "spirited lumberjack" and "gracefully awkward" traits are mentioned but not vividly shown through actions or dialogue, lacking depth in motivation and distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the coded letter and personal transformation is underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The setting of an ossuary-turned-restaurant is intriguing and supports the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; while the theme of healing through the past is present, itâ€™s told rather than shown, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by generic metaphors and a predictable transformation narrative; emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks a unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth, leaving little lingering impact or creative spark.</comment>
