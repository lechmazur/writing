<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to decode star maps is clear, but his "uniquely literal" attribute feels underexplored and does not distinctly shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the action of "overcharging" feels vague and lacks logical grounding; pacing is rushed at the climax, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement sets an eerie tone that contrasts with Eli's calm, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the phone booth key feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story aims for hope and discovery but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; lacks subtext or deeper conflict, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative leans on clich√©s of salvation through ancient knowledge without subversion; descriptions are generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than evoked through nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style lacks clarity and depth; it feels constrained by length rather than deliberately concise, missing a lingering impact.</comment>
