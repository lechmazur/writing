<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; the "late-blooming hero" concept feels surface-level with little exploration of internal conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the action of uniting survivors lacks specificity or tension to drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is evocative and supports the renewal theme, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with themes of loss and hope, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing, diminishing impact; ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the narrative leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but lacks a lingering impact or depth; style is clear but unremarkable for a top-tier publication.</comment>
