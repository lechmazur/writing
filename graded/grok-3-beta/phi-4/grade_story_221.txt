<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to step out of family shadows is clear, but Eli's "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" trait feels underutilized and disconnected from actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; connection between amber and treasure hunt is tenuous, and pacing suffers from abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting is evocative and supports tone, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere aligns with melancholic tone, yet lacks depth in connecting to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with "thawing heart" metaphor, but impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; ending feels predictable, lacking subtext or lasting tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d imagery (glowing amber, spirits lifting weight) without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but integration feels forced; style is clear but uninspired, and brevity exposes lack of depth rather than enhancing impact.</comment>
