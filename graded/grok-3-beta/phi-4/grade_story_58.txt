<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's fierce loyalty is mentioned but not demonstrated through actions or conflict. Motivation to learn meditation feels generic and lacks depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the meditation journey lacks a clear arc or escalating tension within the tight word limit. Pacing feels rushed, with insufficient buildup to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a striking atmosphere of sanctified dread, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact; while imagery like moths dancing is evocative, the narrative leans on telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors (storms within, dancing moths) and generic emotional descriptors. Writing feels formulaic at times, lacking a distinct authorial voice or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. The brief length feels limiting, and the narrative lacks a lingering, thought-provoking impact.</comment>
