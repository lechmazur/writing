<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elara's focus as a collector is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to triumph over despair feels abstract and lacks specificity in emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks depth; the sudden invitation drives the story forward, but the resolution feels predictable and rushed within the word limit, missing a nuanced arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is evocative, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the black rose or solitude feels underdeveloped, missing opportunities for richer atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; symbolism of the black rose is repetitive and heavy-handed, and the ending feels more stated than earned, with little subtext or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by clich√©d metaphors (e.g., "dance with shadows") and predictable narrative patterns; emotional portrayal is surface-level, lacking nuanced human complexity or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels forced around assigned elements rather than cohesive; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
