<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Eli's quest to overcome doubt, but his personality lacks depth or distinctiveness; reactions to the sea glass feel symbolic but not personal, missing a unique voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed; connections between decoding microfilm and resolution are vague, lacking strong cause-effect logic, making the story feel incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting is evocative and ties to isolation, with some sensory detail like creaking metal; however, atmosphere lacks richer sensory immersion and deeper connection to the sea glass or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance with loss and hope, but relies on telling over showing; symbolism of sea glass is heavy-handed, and the ending feels repetitive rather than impactful, lacking subtext or fresh insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on predictable metaphors (sea glass as beacon) and generic descriptors; lacks originality in tone or perspective, with stated emotions rather than nuanced reactions, suggesting formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but feels built around them rather than driven by narrative need; style is clear but uninspired, and brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
