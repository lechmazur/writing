<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to banish doubt is clear, but the transition from city planner to doomsday prepper feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in shaping Rajiv's actions or personality beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a symbolic release of the ink blotter, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between studying broken constellations and the resolution is vague and unconvincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative with sensory details like incense and flickering lamps, but its connection to the character’s motivation and the ink blotter feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Symbolism of the ink blotter and self-imposed chains offers some subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by repetitive telling of Rajiv’s liberation rather than showing nuanced transformation; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes of personal transformation without fresh perspective; metaphors like "broken constellations" feel generic and overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than evoked through nuanced detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
