<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; reconfiguring the rope as a method lacks clear causality to rewriting history, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
