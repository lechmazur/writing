<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's hardheadedness and brokenness are present but underdeveloped; her motivation feels vague and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the prophecy scraps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the struggle driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between prophecy and transformation are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery and snow days create a cohesive, evocative atmosphere that mirrors transience, though sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to nature’s solace feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of power and healing, with some effective symbolism in the gallery, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of redemption and hidden prophecy without fresh subversion; metaphors like “fleeting beauty” feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; it lacks a lingering, thought-provoking impact.</comment>
