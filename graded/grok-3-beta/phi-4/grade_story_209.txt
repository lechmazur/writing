<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal loss is clear, but Eli's personality lacks depth beyond grief; the "artfully messy" attribute feels superficial and underutilized in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between mapping railways and personal truth feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is evocative and supports the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse; the setting's connection to the action and motivation feels more conceptual than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance through grief, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; symbolism of the hairbrush is heavy-handed, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in the setting, but metaphors like "signals danced like fireflies" are clich√©d; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; lacks depth or lingering impact, with style occasionally obscuring clarity.</comment>
