<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Eli's confidence and forcibly gentle nature are mentioned but not deeply explored; motivation feels surface-level and lacks specificity in how it drives actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the connection between the fingerprint discovery and mobilizing the bees feels tenuous and underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The beehive setting is vivid with some sensory detail, but the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the yearning or envy themes; connection to the object feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with yearning, but emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing; ending lacks a strong punch or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>While the beehive setting offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable themes of harmony without fresh subversions; emotions are stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but lacks depth and lingering impact; style is clear but uninspired for a top-tier publication.</comment>
