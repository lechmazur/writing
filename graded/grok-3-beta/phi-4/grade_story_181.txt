<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eliana's secretive nature is mentioned but not deeply explored or reflected in her actions. Motivation to find lost technologies feels stated rather than organic, lacking emotional depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of decoding doodles drives the story but feels contrived. Pacing is rushed, and the arc lacks a strong middle, with the ending feeling more hopeful than resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bird sanctuary setting is evocative with sensory details like chirping birds, but its connection to lost technologies feels tenuous. The tone of edgy nostalgia is present but inconsistently applied to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth; it aims for impact but relies on telling over showing. Symbolism of the dried flower is heavy-handed, and the ending feels predictable rather than satisfying. No strong subtext emerges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by generic descriptors and predictable romantic tension. Metaphors like the glowing flower feel clich√©d, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced. Lacks a unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than integral. Style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice. Lacks lingering depth.</comment>
