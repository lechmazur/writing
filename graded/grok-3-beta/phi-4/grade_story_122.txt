<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; Aeliana's "patiently frantic" attribute feels superficially applied without nuanced exploration of internal conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed; the connection between the bridle and refracting lightning is tenuous and lacks logical grounding within the narrative framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sky burial site is evocative and ties to the tone of endings and beginnings, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (storm as chaos) are effective, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels predictable rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept of a cyber-templar is intriguing, the execution relies on generic descriptors and overused metaphors (e.g., "danced like a serpent"), lacking a truly unique voice or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often feels forced, and the brevity exposes a lack of depth; it fails to leave a lasting impression or provoke deeper thought.</comment>
