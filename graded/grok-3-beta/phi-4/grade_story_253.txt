<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a basic arc with the quest for the chip, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between betrayal and action are vague; coherence is maintained but lacks depth within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Electronic wilderness refuge is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the classroom timeframe feels disconnected from the broader setting and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d tropes of betrayal and time mastery without subversion; metaphors are overused, and emotional depiction is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance or originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but forced around assigned elements; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
