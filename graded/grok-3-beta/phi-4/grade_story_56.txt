<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eliot's shift from deception to honesty feels abrupt and unearned, lacking depth in motivation or internal conflict. Clara's role is underdeveloped, serving more as a plot device than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the meet-cute and resolution feel rushed within the word limit, and the connection between the blank price tag and the broader arc is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The setting of a reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of gentle harshness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth and memorable impact; symbolism (e.g., blank price tag) feels forced, and the ending, while purposeful, does not resonate due to weak conflict development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is compromised by predictable tropes (meet-cute, sudden honesty); writing lacks a distinct style, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel awkwardly integrated, and the brief length exposes a lack of depth rather than showcasing deliberate restraint.</comment>
