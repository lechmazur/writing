<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; Elara's motivation for tracking butterflies feels vague and disconnected from her actions, and Thorne's role is underdeveloped, serving merely as a sounding board.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution; the action of sending Morse code signals feels repetitive and fails to build meaningful tension or progression within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is evocative and supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the character's unconventional love or motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story struggles to evoke a strong emotional response; imagery and symbolism (e.g., butterflies as hope) are present but feel heavy-handed and lack subtlety or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but relies on predictable tropes of hope in darkness without fresh perspective; emotional descriptions are stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive but forced by assigned elements; lacks a lingering impact or depth, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
