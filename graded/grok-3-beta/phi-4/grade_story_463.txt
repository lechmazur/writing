<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn traditional methods and unlock secrets via dance feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; the dry wit is mentioned but not effectively shown through dialogue or action, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced with the dance as a method to unlock secrets; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect between dance and revelations, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse bedroom setting creates a moody atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and generic; connection between setting and frayed rope is symbolic yet underexplored, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with rope and dance, but emotional impact is shallow due to telling over showing; ending lacks satisfaction, and central conflict feels vague and unresolved within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable haunted setting tropes without subversion; metaphors like dancing shadows are overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking originality and nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation, not a deliberate choice.</comment>
