<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's awe is present but lacks depth in shaping a distinct personality; motivation to topple the idol feels stated rather than deeply felt or nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but the connection between snowflake patterns and toppling the idol feels conceptually vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes create a striking, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the emotional tone slightly clashes with the emotionless world premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts some reflection on empathy and fear, with decent use of symbolism (veil, snowflakes), but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable metaphors (snowflakes as empathy); lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
