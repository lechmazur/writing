<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elias's "rattled" nature and inwardly social trait are mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to entwine science and wonder is clear but lacks emotional depth or specificity in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc with puzzles driving progression, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between dance lessons and the core action is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting of the psychic research facility is intriguing but underdeveloped with minimal sensory detail; atmosphere supports the tone of mystery but lacks vivid immersion to enhance mood or character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance and deeper subtext; while the ending is purposeful, it leans on telling rather than showing, and literary devices like symbolism with the postcard feel forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable progression; metaphors are clich√©d, and emotional portrayal is stated rather than nuanced, suggesting formulaic tendencies over unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite incorporating assigned elements; the story feels built around them rather than using them organically, and the style lacks clarity or depth to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
