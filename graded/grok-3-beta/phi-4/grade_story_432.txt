<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Liora's death wish is present but underdeveloped; her motivation as a poison taster feels superficial and lacks depth in shaping her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the action of binding energy flows feels forced and lacks clear cause-effect logic; pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall setting is evocative and supports the tone of serene upheaval, with decent sensory detail, but its connection to the ice sculpture and bookmark feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with the ice sculpture, but emotional impact is weak; it tells more than shows, and the ending lacks a satisfying resolution or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on generic metaphors (ice as fragility) and predictable tropes of hidden societies without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion among assigned elements, feeling built around them rather than using them organically; it lacks a lingering impact or creative depth.</comment>
