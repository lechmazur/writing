<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the lost apprentice seeking freedom, and the first-person voice is distinct, but development feels surface-level; reactions to the bird’s nest and self-acceptance lack deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions (e.g., finding the shuttle) are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the interstellar orchard ship is vividly imagined with sensory details like antimatter blossoms, enhancing atmosphere; tone of mocking affection complements the concept, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through self-acceptance theme and uses strong imagery (e.g., cage metaphor), but emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing; ending is satisfying yet lacks deeper resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, and the brief length suits the introspective tone; it leaves a lingering thought on freedom, though overall impact is hindered by uneven depth.</comment>
