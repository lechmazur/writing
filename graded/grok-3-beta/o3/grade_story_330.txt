<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Calder's dejection and motivation to voice a silent vow are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of a fallen knight; his actions align with his motivation, yet his voice feels indistinct and overly symbolic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the action of quickening a vow drives the story, but cause-effect links are vague, and pacing stumbles with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The zero-gravity dance hall is vividly realized with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of sacred disorder; however, the connection between setting and trident prong feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism evoke thought, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is diluted by overt telling over showing; subtext exists but lacks subtlety in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, some metaphors are overused, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate prose; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style sometimes obscures clarity with dense language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
