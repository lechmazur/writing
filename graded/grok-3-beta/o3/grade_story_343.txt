<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a satisfying resolution, and the action of analyzing tea leaves drives the narrative creatively, though pacing feels slightly rushed toward the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine interior is vividly realized with sensory details like humming girders and briny air, enhancing the atmosphere of crooked hope, though the timeframe of paint drying feels underexplored as a mood element.</comment>
