<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Yeru's portrayal as a nimble locksmith with a metaphysical edge is intriguing, but his motivation to preserve dances feels underdeveloped and slightly disconnected from his established skills; his reactions and actions lack deeper personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of prancing and the concept of a storm of secrets driving progression, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and some cause-effect links, like the sudden spectral dancers, are abrupt and lack grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (salt-stung mist, creaking gate), enhancing the mystical atmosphere and complementing the tone of jaded wonder; however, the timeframe's integration with the setting feels slightly forced at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its themes of cultural preservation, with strong imagery and symbolism (apples as dance steps), but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (clouds as locked cabinets) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated outcomes than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but occasionally veers into ornate prose that distracts from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought about cultural legacy, though not powerfully so.</comment>
