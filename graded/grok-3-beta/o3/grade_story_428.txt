<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to banish doubt is clear, but Rajiv's transition from city planner to doomsday prepper lacks depth; his actions feel driven by plot needs rather than a distinct personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the handshake; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the ancient Indian temple is vividly described with sensory details like "leaking gold" and "humid dust," enhancing atmosphere and supporting the tone of daring caution; however, timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through Rajiv's struggle, with strong imagery like "broken constellations," but dialogue is minimal and lacks impact; subtext is present but not fully developed; ending feels purposeful yet slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like "geometry of heaven," avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptions verge on purple prose; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the ink blotter, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; brief length works but limits depth; leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
