<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's unique trait of seeing ghosts and being elegantly clumsy is intriguing and shapes actions, but motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the drive to liberate ghosts lacks deeper personal stakes or backstory for full resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the ghost tour staking method is underutilized, and some causal links between actions and outcomes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the sand castle preservation lab is vividly described with sensory details like desalinated mist, enhancing atmosphere; tone of complex simplicity aligns with concept, though connection between setting and character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the ghost boy's release and uses potent imagery like "hourglass snow," with a satisfying ending; however, central conflict feels small-scale and lacks deeper subtext or thematic weight beyond surface liberation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining ghosts and sand castles, with fresh metaphors, but some phrases like "uncomplicated peace" feel generic; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and brief length suits the quiet resolution; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity, and lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
