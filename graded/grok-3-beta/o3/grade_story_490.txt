<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The caretaker's personality is distinct with "enthusiastic apathy," but motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks grounding in tangible stakes; actions align with longing but lack deeper personal history or voice to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the forbidden allure, but pacing feels uneven with rushed resolution; cause and effect are logical, though coherence wavers with overly poetic detours.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting of the caravan repair station and post-wave shore is vividly rendered with sensory details like "rust and salted ghosts," enhancing mood and motivation; atmosphere strongly supports the forbidden theme, though timeframe integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (lavender as starlight, forbidden hum) evoke thought and emotion, but the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying; conflict is present but underdeveloped; subtext exists, though it risks being overshadowed by ornate language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like "newborn galaxy" are fresh, some phrases feel overly elaborate, bordering on purple prose; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but the narrative leans on predictable longing tropes without enough subversion; style is distinct but occasionally overreaches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, style sometimes hinders clarity with excessive flourish; it leaves a lingering feeling of yearning, though not sharply defined.</comment>
