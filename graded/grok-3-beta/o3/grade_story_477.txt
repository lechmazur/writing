<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Koji’s motivation to escape suppression is clear and drives his actions, but his "graceful swordsman" trait feels underutilized beyond poetic movement; deeper personality nuance or voice is lacking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with innovation driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between scavenging and unforeseen consequences is somewhat forced, lacking tighter causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like bird songs and glowing lilies, enhancing the atmosphere of lucid frenzy; however, the setting’s connection to the telescope feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through themes of individuality and consequence, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and emotional depth is more stated than shown through nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and concept, some metaphors (e.g., "jellyfish lanterns") feel overused, and emotional resonance leans on explicit description rather than subtle showing; style is distinct but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of possibility, but overly poetic language sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
