<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Felix's clumsily dexterous nature is well-integrated into his actions as a sound engineer, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the personal stake in the music school burning is mentioned but not deeply felt or explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a creative use of sound manipulation as the central action, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between pantomime and silencing the crowd is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch's cauldron room and the atmosphere of practical illusion are vividly rendered with sensory details like nettle and bone, enhancing the mood, though the setting's connection to the public square feels slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue through its unique premise and use of silence as retribution, with strong imagery like "a library sealed in snow," but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper character connection, and the ending feels more clever than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in its concept of sound as a weapon and avoids overt clich√©s, with fresh metaphors like "velvet quiet"; however, some sensory details are generic, and the tone occasionally shifts to overly ornate language that borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like sound manipulation and silent retribution, but the style sometimes prioritizes flair over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
