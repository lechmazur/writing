<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Calliope’s motivation to track migratory butterflies is clear and ties to her apothecary background, but her personality lacks depth beyond quirky traits; her voice isn’t distinct enough in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between butterfly release and ceasefire are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like rust and frost, enhancing the battered marvel tone, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through unconventional love, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly contrived, and conflict resolution lacks full impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the steampunk-butterfly-war concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., “iron wolves”) feel overused, and emotional nuance is sometimes stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
