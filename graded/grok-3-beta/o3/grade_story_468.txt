<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlow's curiosity as a mortician drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivations are clear but not nuanced, and his voice feels somewhat generic despite unique actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between actions and concepts are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like jasmine and ozone; the mangrove labyrinth enhances the mood of mystery, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept and imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., "cremation pyre") feel overused; tone is consistent, though emotional depth relies on description over nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; length feels deliberate, yet lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact.</comment>
