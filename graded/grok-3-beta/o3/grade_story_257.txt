<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's intellectual dreaminess and overqualification are evident, shaping her unique approach to her role, but her deeper motivations remain somewhat vague, lacking specificity in emotional depth or backstory to fully ground her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from tradition to reinvention is clear within the word limit, with postcards driving the action logically, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between her actions and the crowd's transformation are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The seaside tavern and fireflies create a vivid, moody atmosphere that complements the tone of bruised exhilaration; sensory details like fog-wetted alleys are evocative, though some setting elements feel underutilized in enhancing character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through its theme of restored faith, with strong imagery and symbolism (postcards as embers), but the ending feels slightly pat, and the central conflict of tradition versus reinvention lacks nuanced tension or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on breaking traditions via postcards, some metaphors (e.g., "chapel of lost itineraries") feel ornate and slightly forced; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of postcards and fireflies, but the style occasionally overreaches with florid language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
