<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's reserved nature and humbly proud posture are reflected in her quiet determination, but her motivation to preserve art feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes or backstory within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the mending of the cuffs as a central action, but pacing feels uneven; the secrecy and method of communication via wallpaper scrawls seem overly convoluted for the story's scale, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly imagined and complements the choir practice timeframe, with strong sensory details like voices through vents; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character focus, diluting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through the ripple effect theme and uses potent imagery like "cuffs glittered like dawn on still water," but the ending feels slightly forced in its optimism, and the conflict resolution lacks visceral tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a sound laboratory and reverse resonance is original, some metaphors (e.g., "drop in water") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like choir practice and lost sounds, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
