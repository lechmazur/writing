<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear, with Talis’s exile and loneliness driving his actions, but Liora’s sudden reappearance lacks depth in backstory or emotional grounding, making their reunion feel convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the snowstorm encounter and the cure feels contrived rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a haunting, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like sleet rattling and ink smells, though the setting’s connection to the cure for loneliness feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant sense of longing and reconciliation, with effective imagery like “bitter light,” but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch, and dialogue, while sparse, feels slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of alchemy and exile, some metaphors like “fever in his blood” feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the mortar and pestle, but the style occasionally veers into overwrought prose, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
