<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Garrick's no-nonsense yet empathic nature is evident in his methodical care for the dolls, but his motivation feels slightly abstract and lacks deeper personal stakes or conflict to fully ground his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven, with overly dense imagery slowing the middle, and the causal links between actions and outcomes are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the eerie tone and complementing the concept of preserved traditions, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic emotional response and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the stained glass heart), but the ending feels more poetic than conclusive, and the central conflict remains underdeveloped for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "dawnlessness reigns") feel ornate and slightly forced, and emotional resonance relies more on stated longing than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally prioritizes flourish over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
