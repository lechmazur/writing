<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Harlan's gloom and orchardist background are well-integrated into his motivation to atone for past failures, but his transition to acoustician feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in how this shift shapes his personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the data leak, and the connection between lullabies and orchard revival lacks clear cause-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance testing facility and timeframe of "past meets prophecy" create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like peach-blossom scent, though the setting's connection to the skull feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (lullabies as forgiveness) evoke emotion, and the ending is purposeful, but the central conflict with smugglers feels underdeveloped, and some metaphors border on overwrought, diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "silence closed like orchard loam") feel slightly generic, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overly ornate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the lingering impact is muted by unresolved subplots like the smugglers.</comment>
