<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Callen’s subdued vigilante nature and artfully clumsy attribute are present but underdeveloped; motivation to master an ancient art feels vague and lacks depth in personal stakes beyond generic redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels forced by the mirror distortions method; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect in the transformation of trauma to peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abandoned waiting area and screaming silence tone create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like moonlight shards, but setting’s connection to virtual calls feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through war imagery and trauma, with decent use of symbolism (mirror, bead), but ending feels overly neat and lacks nuanced subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in mirror distortions and war memories, but relies on overused metaphors (wounded water, dawn over ashes) and lacks nuanced emotional depth, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style leans toward ornate over clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with only faint lingering thought.</comment>
