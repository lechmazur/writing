<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orion's cosmic powers and factory worker identity are intriguing, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the internal conflict is clear, yet his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue and narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the climax; the ritual drives the story, yet the resolution lacks depth due to pacing issues within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like furnace air and grinding stone, though the setting's connection to the factory life feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (grease to galaxies) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by overt telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the cosmic-factory blend is original, some metaphors (footprints of doubt) feel overused; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally slips into stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea, though not powerfully so.</comment>
