<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between impersonation and law-rewriting feels tenuous and underexplained, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vapor collection facility is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like "holy mist" and "sibilant singing," enhancing the atmosphere and complementing the peculiar faith tone.</comment>
