<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Mara’s guilt and medical curiosity driving her quest, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "bleary-eyed physician" trope; reactions and voice feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the cavern discovery; cause and effect are logical, though coherence suffers from abrupt rival interruptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the digital nomad camp juxtaposed with ancient legends creates a striking atmosphere; sensory details like "barnacled ribs" and "crushed herbs" enhance immersion, though modern elements like drones feel slightly discordant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response with Mara’s mission to honor the dying, but literary devices like coffee ground patterns feel forced; ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext or lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on pirate treasure tropes without subversion; metaphors like "charmed constellations" are somewhat fresh but not striking; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, lacking deeper lingering impact.</comment>
