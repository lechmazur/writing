<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Percival's uptight nature is well-defined and drives his initial rigidity, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual shift. His motivation is clear, yet his voice could be more distinct in dialogue or thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of bellowing and the method of analyzing adhesive logically tied to the resolution. However, pacing feels uneven—some moments linger too long on imagery, while key emotional beats are rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witch's greenhouse and gravestone hill create a vivid, eerie atmosphere that complements the tone of buried optimism. Sensory details are strong, though some (like damp leaves) are overused. The setting enhances the action but could tie more directly to the light bulb's significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through its theme of empathy and transformation, with effective metaphors like "margins wide enough for grief." The ending is satisfying, but the central conflict feels understated, and some emotional depth is told rather than shown. Subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some imagery (e.g., "moonlight smeared like half-erased sentences") borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing. The style is distinct but not entirely free of cliché or over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style sometimes obscures clarity with dense imagery. It leaves a lingering thought, but the impact is diminished by uneven emotional depth and pacing.</comment>
