<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysandra's portrayal as a glamorous undertaker is intriguing, and her motivation to preserve ancient practices is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the surface flair; her reactions and voice feel stylized rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and end tied to archiving and painting, but pacing feels unevenâ€”some moments linger too long on imagery, disrupting narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is vividly realized with sensory details like humming and cold tiles, enhancing the atmosphere of jubilant remorse, though the connection between setting and timeframe (paint mixing) feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic reflection on memory and loss through strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels more poetic than purposeful, and the central conflict remains subtle to a fault.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., "champagne bubble of sound") feel ornate and slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overly elaborate style sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks a sharp, memorable impact.</comment>
