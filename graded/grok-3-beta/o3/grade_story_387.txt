<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Rhys show potential with clear selfless motivation tied to music and trust, but development feels surface-level; Kestrel's betrayal lacks depth or backstory, making her actions predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, conflict, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution via shared music feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the recycled spaceship and timeframe across centuries create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like creaking sails and subsonic moans; tone aligns well with savage grace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through themes of trust and resonance, with strong imagery and subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by overly ornate language; ending is satisfying yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of musical echolocation is original, some metaphors feel forced or generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but style occasionally hinders clarity with dense prose; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
