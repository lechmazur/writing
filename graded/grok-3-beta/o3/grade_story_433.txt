<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's hardheadedness and broken heart are evident, shaping her persistence, but her inner voice and emotional depth lack nuance; her motivations feel stated rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the sacrifice; cause and effect are logical, yet some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The snowy setting and ephemeral gallery create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like crunching boots and frosted veins; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (snow as memory, frost as sacrifice) evoke emotion, and the ending is poignant; yet, the central conflict feels slightly underdeveloped, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "brittle wishes") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies partly on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing; tone is consistent but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
