<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Garrick's desire to escape a dead end, but his sullen nature feels underexplored beyond surface despair; actions align with motivation, yet lack deeper nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, driven by the concept of erasing boundaries; pacing is managed well, though some causal links (stamps activating doors) feel contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Underwater city setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like algae-flecked light, enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone of borrowed valor; connection to objects feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (quilt as lineage, stamps as passports) and subtext about grief and limits, with a satisfying ending; emotional resonance is present but occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like quilts and underwater settings, but metaphors (e.g., "curious dogs") feel generic; emotional handling lacks nuance at times, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of hope; style supports clarity but occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering impact.</comment>
