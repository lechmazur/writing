<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orrin’s morbid nature as a florist is intriguing, but his motivations and reactions lack depth; they feel more symbolic than personal, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between cosmic cycles and the action of reading pages is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and violet stratosphere create a vivid, surreal atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like petals and lantern flickers, though the setting occasionally overshadows character motives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (petals, decay, renewal) evoke thought, but the emotional impact is muted by abstract language; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the surreal setting and concept are original, some metaphors (e.g., “clarified grief”) feel overwrought, and emotional portrayal leans toward stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but overly ornate style sometimes hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as sharply as it could.</comment>
