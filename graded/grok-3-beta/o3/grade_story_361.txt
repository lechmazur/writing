<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Galen's mild-mannered nature and role as a trapper are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to rescue indigenous knowledge feels noble but lacks personal depth or emotional stakes beyond the surface mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but the method of using chalk equations feels contrived at times, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of organized disorder, though the connection between setting and character motivation feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its themes of cultural preservation, with strong imagery and symbolism (dice, chalk dust), but the ending lacks emotional punch, and the conflict resolution feels too neat for the stakes implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of retro-futurism and indigenous themes, some metaphors (e.g., "starlight clinging to mathematics") feel overwrought, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength; it leaves a lingering idea but not a deep emotional impact.</comment>
