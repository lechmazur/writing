<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vega’s moral code as a hacker shapes her mission to restore Licinia’s name, but her personality lacks depth beyond this paradox; motivation is clear but reactions and voice feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between beginning and end lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Roman marketplace reimagined in AR is vividly described with sensory details like bergamot and pixel fruit, enhancing atmosphere; however, the setting’s connection to tea steeping feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with themes of redemption, and imagery like “execution wounds” is striking; yet, the ending feels predictable, and subtext is underdeveloped for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of humanizing a historical figure is fresh, some metaphors like “steam ghosted upward” feel slightly overused; tone is consistent, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like bottle caps and AR Rome, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
