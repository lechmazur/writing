<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to weave emotional honesty into illusions is clear, and the chameleon actor trait shapes Yuan-Li's actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the surface attribute; reactions to the doll’s dress feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the tunnel discovery; cause and effect are logical, though coherence suffers from abrupt shifts in focus within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of a reimagined ancient Chinese palace post-oil collapse is evocative and enhances the mood of anxious serenity; sensory details like sunlight through debris are vivid, though some connections between setting and action feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through its layered mystery and use of symbolism (doll’s dress, sunlight patterns), but emotional impact is diluted by over-telling rather than showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining futuristic decay with ancient mystery, and metaphors like “rat skeletons glinted like ivory actors” are fresh; however, some emotional descriptions feel stated rather than nuanced, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
