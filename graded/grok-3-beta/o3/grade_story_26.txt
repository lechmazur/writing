<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kara's sleep-deprived state is well-integrated into her motivation and actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond exhaustion and determination; her voice feels indistinct despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of animating the orchard driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax—and some cause-effect links are vague, like the bell's broader impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The neon orchard setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the cyberpunk atmosphere and complementing the concept of shame as code; however, the timeframe's integration feels slightly peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on shame and resilience through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict feels somewhat abstract, and the theme's delivery occasionally leans on overt explanation rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story offers originality in its cyberpunk metaphor for shame, some imagery borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally feels stated rather than nuanced; metaphors are fresh but not always precise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about collective healing, but overly ornate style sometimes hinders clarity, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
