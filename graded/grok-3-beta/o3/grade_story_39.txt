<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Idris’s motivation to sculpt a new tomorrow is clear and aligns with his deceptive yet earnest nature, but his personality lacks depth beyond the tailor trope; reactions to the lantern and ghosts feel surface-level, missing a distinct voice or nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from salvaging to saving the biodome is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the child phantom’s sudden appearance as the dome’s essence disrupts narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The biodome on Mars is vividly rendered with sensory details like red dust and flickering lamps, enhancing the atmosphere of endurance; tone of cautious abandon complements the setting, though some connections between setting and ghostly bookshop mysteries feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (stitches as turning pages) evoke thought, and the ending is purposeful; however, emotional resonance is uneven due to telling over showing, and the central conflict of dome survival feels resolved too neatly within constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of wearable stories is original, metaphors like “storms raged like libraries aflame” feel slightly overused; emotional handling lacks nuance, often stating rather than showing, and the tone shifts slightly with the child phantom’s introduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the lantern and biodome, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of renewal, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
