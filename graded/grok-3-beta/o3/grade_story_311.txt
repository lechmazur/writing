<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to break free is clear and tied to the tense bodyguard persona, but the inner conflict lacks deeper nuance; the first-person voice is distinct yet occasionally overwrought, missing subtle emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete with a clear escape trajectory, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like Maraâ€™s introduction; logical flow is maintained, though some cause-effect links are underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like pollen and stale oxygen, enhancing the atmosphere of confinement; tone of serene anger aligns well with the setting, though some details feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a sense of longing through the photograph and escape, with strong imagery like "lunar dust feathers upward"; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and dialogue lacks distinctiveness, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like "serenity cloaks that hum," but some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi escape tropes without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the greenhouse and photograph; it leaves a lingering sense of defiance, but style occasionally hinders clarity with dense phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
