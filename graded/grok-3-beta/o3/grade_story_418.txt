<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Calla Flint's headstrong nature is evident in her determination to restore color, but her emotional depth and transformation into "softstrong" feel somewhat abrupt and underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from confession to transformation is clear, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, and the spell's mechanics lack sufficient grounding for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms create a vivid, desolate atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like "candied thunder," though the setting's connection to the stained glass box feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (glitter as transformation) evoke emotion, but the central conflict of confession feels resolved too quickly, and subtext around envy lacks deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on color and transformation, some metaphors (e.g., "frost on ashes") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but rushed emotional beats and occasional ornate language hinder clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
