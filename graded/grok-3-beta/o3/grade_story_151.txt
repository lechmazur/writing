<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cress's motivation to restore emotion is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the veil; his actions align with intent but lack depth beyond the conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit; cultivating emotion drives the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some causal links are abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and post-emotion timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like ice floes and foghorns; the setting deeply supports the mood, though object-setting connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (veil, idol) and imagery evokes thought, with a satisfying ending; subtext about fear and empathy is present, but emotional resonance is somewhat told rather than shown, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its premise and metaphors, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "crystal shadows") feel ornate and slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about emotion's return; style is evocative but occasionally overcomplex, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
