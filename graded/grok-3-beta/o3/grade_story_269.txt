<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing with Galen’s nostalgia and tailoring background shaping his introspective nature, but motivation feels slightly vague—ascending beyond mortal limits lacks deeper personal grounding. Dialogue and voice are distinct, though reactions sometimes lean on exposition rather than action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, with confessions driving tension, but pacing feels uneven—early setup is dense, and the resolution rushes. Logical flow is mostly maintained, though the mirror-breaking climax feels abrupt and under-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk observation deck is vividly realized with sensory details like rain on glass gears and hissing valves, enhancing atmosphere. Tone of hopeful desperation aligns well with setting, though some sensory elements (e.g., lightning equations) feel over-engineered and distract from immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through themes of duality and hope, with strong imagery (threads of realities knotting). Subtext about reconciling pasts is present, but dialogue feels slightly stilted. Ending is satisfying yet lacks full emotional punch due to rushed resolution. Shows more than tells, though not consistently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is mixed—parallel lives and steampunk are familiar, but the tailor’s lens offers a fresh angle. Metaphors like stitching worlds are creative yet occasionally overdone, bordering on purple prose. Emotional nuance exists but sometimes feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length seems deliberate. Creative combination of tailoring and parallel lives lingers, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and depth feels constrained by the scope, missing a truly profound afterthought.</comment>
