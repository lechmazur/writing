<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Father Silas Crane's rattled state as an exorcist is evident, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; the internal conflict with demons is mentioned but not deeply explored, limiting the depth of his voice and reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by puzzles and the concept of guarded disclosures, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like the demons’ involvement) are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lessons create a unique, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details like lavender and static; however, the setting’s connection to character motivation feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and tension through its mystery, with effective imagery and subtext about faith and science, but the ending feels more theatrical than satisfying, and emotional depth is often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original blend of exorcism and psychic research, some metaphors (e.g., “doves dyed in nightmares”) feel overwrought, and emotional resonance lacks nuance, occasionally leaning on stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about faith versus science, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity sometimes undermines deeper impact.</comment>
