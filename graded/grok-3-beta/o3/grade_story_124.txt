<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jericho's skittish nature and obsession with the subconscious mind are clear, but his motivations lack depth and specificity, feeling more symbolic than personal; his voice is distinct but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the end; the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, and the pacing struggles to balance action with introspection within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lunar colony setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like aftershave and humming alloys, enhancing the rustic refinement tone; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (loom as subconscious) create impact, and the ending is thought-provoking, but emotional resonance is uneven due to overreliance on abstract concepts over shown emotion.</comment>
