<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the heretic's drive to challenge an omniscient mind, tied to personal history via the sister and teddy bear, but the "blunt" trait feels underexplored in action or dialogue, lacking a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the battle through codes, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like the mirror's sudden appearance) are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library in a deserted temple is vividly rendered with sensory details like dust and shattered glass, enhancing the anxious elation, though the connection between setting and teddy bear feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (teddy bear as relic, liquid code mirror) and subtext around promises and betrayal evoke thought, but the ending feels slightly overwrought, and emotional depth is more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery like "dust spiraled like timid ghosts" is fresh, but some metaphors are ornate, bordering on purple prose; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced showing, and the narrative occasionally feels formulaic in its mystical tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the stock ticker, leaving a lingering question about the duelâ€™s outcome, but overly complex language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
