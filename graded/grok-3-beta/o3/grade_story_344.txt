<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marin's claustrophobia as an underwater explorer is intriguing, but his internal conflict lacks deeper exploration; motivation to study human behavior feels slightly detached from his personal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between tasting jam and behavioral study is creative but not fully logical or developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house setting is vividly imagined with strong sensory details like cardamom and steam, enhancing the quietly bold tone and atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through Marinâ€™s childhood memories and uses symbolism (glasses as perspective), but the central conflict of claustrophobia feels underexplored; ending is satisfying yet not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of jam as confession is original, some metaphors (e.g., "corridor inside his mind") feel generic; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like jam and glasses, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
