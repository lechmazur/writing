<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mardin's grumpiness is evident, but his deeper motivations and emotional transformation feel somewhat surface-level; the shift from avoidance to surrender lacks nuanced buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution; connections between trauma and cosmic silence are intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witch's crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, mystical atmosphere; sensory details like shimmering quartz and star-light are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mardin's memories and surrender, with strong symbolism in the mandala; however, the ending feels slightly pat, and dialogue occasionally lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on trauma and cosmic connection, some metaphors (e.g., "knights of regret") feel clich√©d; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally slips into overt telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent; however, style sometimes overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
