<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "nondescript seer" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to unearth a relic feels vague and lacks personal stakes, though the first-person voice is distinct with a cynical edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by untangling the USB drive, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; logical flow is maintained despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Abandoned control tower setting enhances the eerie, isolated mood, and sensory details like confetti and petrichor are vivid, though the timeframe after a party feels slightly disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity and mild tension through delayed justice theme; imagery and metaphors are strong, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character depth; ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the scent-based decryption method and mythic relic concept, avoiding clich√©s, though some metaphors (e.g., "falling verdicts") feel slightly overworked; tone is consistent and style distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but brevity limits depth; style supports clarity, and lingering questions about the relic add intrigue, though emotional impact is restrained.</comment>
