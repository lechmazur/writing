<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Milo's transition from jaded bartender to researcher is intriguing, and his motivation to understand the past through crystals is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this obsession; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the connection between doodles and crystal resonance feels forced and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory and the timeframe before fireworks create a vivid, tense atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like pulsing stalagmites and ultraviolet lamps; however, the setting's connection to the scalpel feels contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and offers subtext about memory and healing, with strong imagery like "crystals glowed a forgiving dawn-pink"; yet, the emotional impact is diluted by over-explained revelations and a resolution that feels too neat for the complexity introduced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of crystals storing memories is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic metaphors ("smoke he had been carrying") and lacks nuanced emotional showing; the narrative style is distinctive but occasionally veers into overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the scalpel and laboratory, leaving a lingering thought about redesigning memory; however, the style sometimes obscures clarity with dense imagery, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
