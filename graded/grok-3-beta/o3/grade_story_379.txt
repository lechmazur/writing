<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to catalogue disappearing languages is clear and drives actions, but Hale Keswick's trickster lawyer persona feels underdeveloped beyond backstory mentions; first-person voice is distinct but lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the drone chase; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the futuristic biodome farm is vividly rendered with sensory details like "photosynthetic electricity" and enhances the ghostly resolve tone; atmosphere supports motivation, though timeframe of stretching feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through the theme of preserving language, with strong imagery like "verbs for wind that can bruise metal"; ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some phrases like "ghostly resolve" are repeated excessively; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and occasional ornate language borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about language preservation; however, style occasionally hinders clarity with overcomplex phrasing, and brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
