<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Florian’s spinelessness is evident, but his motivation to understand flowers feels underdeveloped and inconsistent with his role as a cult leader; his voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like rain pattering and chemical scents; atmosphere supports the doleful cheer tone, though setting-object connection feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (blurring boundaries, floral language) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is uneven; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying; central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others (e.g., “seedling in exhaust fumes”) feel forced; tone is consistent, yet emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown, lacking deeper human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so; length feels managed, not deliberate.</comment>
