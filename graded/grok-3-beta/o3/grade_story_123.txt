<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Emberic Voss's eagerness as a brewer is clear, and his motivation to rekindle a dying realm is consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "gleefully morose" attribute, which feels somewhat forced in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels unevenâ€”some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility and timeframe of empire transitions create a compelling backdrop, enhanced by vivid sensory details like malt smells and aurora-colored foam, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
