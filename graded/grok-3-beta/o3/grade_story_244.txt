<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rika's guilt and reserved boldness are evident, but her inner conflict and motivation lack deeper exploration within the word limit; her voice feels somewhat muted despite the strong premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the pursuit of redemption driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the rosebush's petal and the door's activation is underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The neon repair shop setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the mellow intensity; however, the integration of the rosebush timeframe feels slightly disconnected from the shop's atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (neon as captive auroras, mask as labyrinth) enrich the narrative, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers originality in combining neon and tribal elements, with fresh metaphors, but some descriptions (e.g., "guilt clung like invisible iron") verge on clich√©, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of possibility, but it falls short of flawless execution due to minor pacing issues and underdeveloped character depth; style supports clarity but lacks a truly distinctive edge.</comment>
