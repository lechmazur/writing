<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tarquin’s vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are well-integrated into his actions, but his deeper emotional transformation feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a creative counterattack driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the daughter’s realization, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting and rebellion timeframe create a vivid backdrop, enhanced by sensory details of sugar and glass, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Tarquin’s shift from scorn to wonder, with strong imagery like sugar fireworks, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and subtext is present yet not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the candy sculptor concept is original, some metaphors (e.g., “tiny revolutions”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies at times on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like sugar as rebellion, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the style occasionally leans toward ornate over clarity.</comment>
