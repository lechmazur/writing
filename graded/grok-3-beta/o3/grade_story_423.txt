<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Aldric's earnestness is evident, but his deeper personality and motivations lack nuance; his actions align with the goal, yet his inner voice and emotional depth remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the triggering action driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The desert aqueduct setting and nostalgic tone complement the concept well, with vivid sensory details like "sand whipped against dented armor," though some atmospheric elements feel overdone and distract from immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (water as life, starlight as hope) evoke emotion, and the ending satisfies, but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and subtext, while present, isn't fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While metaphors like "sapphire brushstrokes" are fresh, the story leans on familiar knight-quest tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, muting lasting impact.</comment>
