<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Gregor’s insecurity as an advisor is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond a vague need for approval; his actions align with this trait, yet his voice and reactions remain somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between rumor and resolution is somewhat forced, lacking tighter cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret agent headquarters and futuristic timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like echoing corridors and pulsing lights, though the tone’s fractured idyll occasionally overpowers character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a lingering tension and uses vivid imagery effectively, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on familiar sci-fi tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style feels ornate at times, bordering on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with overcomplex phrasing; it leaves a lingering question, though the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
