<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphors and surreal elements, avoiding clich√©s, but some imagery feels ornate and risks purple prose, slightly undermining authenticity of emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; lingering impact is present but not profound enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
