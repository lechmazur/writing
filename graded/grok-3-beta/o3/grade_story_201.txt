<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mylo’s impulsiveness and whimsy are evident, but his deeper emotional connection to his ancestor’s grief feels underdeveloped and stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the reliance on shooting stars as a method feels contrived and disrupts logical coherence at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall setting is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the restless harmony tone and supporting Mylo’s motivation, though the timeframe of dusk feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through its themes of legacy and redemption, with effective imagery, but the ending feels slightly overwrought, and the conflict resolution lacks deeper subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., “meteor tails”) feel generic, and the emotional resonance relies more on explicit statements than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
