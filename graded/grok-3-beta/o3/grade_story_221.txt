<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's identity as a wreck-diver and ghost whisperer shapes her actions, but her motivation to escape her lineage's shadow feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution. Her voice is distinct in first-person narration, though reactions to the amber and family tradition are more symbolic than revealing of personal nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the action of arousing spirits feels somewhat forced as a driver. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional climaxes, and coherence is strained by abrupt shifts between personal and supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like "brine and burnt sugar," enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting Mara’s motivation. The atmosphere complements the concept of thawing hearts, though the timeframe's integration feels less seamless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mara’s longing and the ghostly encounters, with strong imagery and symbolism (amber as captured sun). However, the ending feels only partially satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharpness. Subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique blend of supernatural and personal themes, some metaphors ("small captured sun") feel slightly overused. Emotional handling shows nuance in places but often states feelings directly. The style is individual but occasionally veers into ornate prose, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel more in service of symbolism than narrative. The brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, and while there’s creative thinking in combining elements, the lingering impact is muted by underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
