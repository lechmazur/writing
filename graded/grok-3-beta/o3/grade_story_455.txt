<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thorn's disgruntlement and paradoxical relaxation are intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift to penitence lacks deeper internal conflict or backstory to fully ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present but feels rushed at the resolution; the connection between coins and wishes is logical, yet the pacing stumbles with abrupt transitions at the bridge scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fairground and secret route create a compelling atmosphere with strong sensory details like phosphorescent arrows, though the setting's connection to spy-craft feels underexplored and slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism with coins as scars evokes thought, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of Thorn's surrender rather than showing nuanced transformation; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a wishing-well keeper's redemption is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., "tiny planets of pain") feel overwrought, and emotional descriptions occasionally lack subtlety, bordering on formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like coins and shadows, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
