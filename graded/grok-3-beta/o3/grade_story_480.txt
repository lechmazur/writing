<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with curiosity driving the social media exorcist, but the personality feels underdeveloped, lacking depth beyond surface traits. The first-person voice is distinct yet repetitive in tone, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax. Cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details like the smell of forgotten errands and the quietly loud corridor. The abandoned mess hall enhances the mood, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with vivid imagery and subtext around memory and relevance, but the emotional resonance is inconsistent. The ending feels purposeful yet lacks a deeper punch; conflict resolution is surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of a social media exorcist and fresh metaphors, but some phrases feel overly ornate, bordering on purple prose. Emotional handling shows nuance at times but occasionally states feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style sometimes hinders clarity with overcomplex language. It leaves a lingering thought, though the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
