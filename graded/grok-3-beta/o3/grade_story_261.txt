<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's immortality is intriguing and shapes their perspective, but motivation to restore the ecosystem feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit; their voice is distinct yet lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times; connections between actions and outcomes are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the particle acceleration garden is vividly realized and enhances the action; sensory details like whirring cyclotrons and bitter laughter are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through its environmental themes and uses striking imagery, but emotional resonance is inconsistent; ending is purposeful yet lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining science and nature, but some metaphors (e.g., "bitter laughter") feel repetitive; emotional depth is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally veers into overly ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as powerfully as it could.</comment>
