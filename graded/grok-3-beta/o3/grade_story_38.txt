<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Morwen Crest's insomniac trait is reflected in her restless micro-sleeps, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and her voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue, relying on cryptic whispers that don't fully reveal personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with warnings driving tension, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax with agents appearing abruptly—and cause-effect links between confessions and resolution are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subway and haunted attic settings are vividly rendered with sensory details like fluorescent hum and dust motes, enhancing the eerie tone of empty abundance, though the connection between settings feels slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and tension through imagery and subtext about non-violence, but the ending feels more poetic than satisfying, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow; theme of peace is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors (leaf as violin string) are fresh, others (dust motes orbiting) feel overused; the narrative shows style but occasionally slips into purple prose, and emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like botanical samples, but the style sometimes obscures clarity with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought on non-violence, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
