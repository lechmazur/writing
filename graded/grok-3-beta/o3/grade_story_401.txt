<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Rilla's complex guilt and motivation to master grief, but the voice feels uneven, and reactions to the ring lack deeper emotional nuance beyond stated guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc with the dive as apology, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between actions and equalization are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like rattling chandeliers, enhancing the manic tone and grief motif, though the coffee ritual feels slightly disconnected from the underwater atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres around its elements with creative intent, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting depth.</comment>
