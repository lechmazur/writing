<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's introversion and dancer background shape her subtle, rhythmic approach to problem-solving, but her motivation feels slightly underdevelopedâ€”her shift from clerical passivity to purposeful escape lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from decoding to escape is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the transition to action is abrupt, and the knitting method, while creative, isn't fully integrated into the narrative's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cipher office setting and wartime atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like clattering typewriters, enhancing the mood of secrecy and tension, though the wasteland's desolation feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (dance, constellations) adds depth, and the ending carries a quiet purpose, but emotional resonance is muted by a lack of nuanced 'showing' over 'telling' in Mira's internal struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of dance and decoding, some metaphors (e.g., "knitting air") feel forced, and emotional portrayal lacks human nuance, leaning toward stated rather than felt experiences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
