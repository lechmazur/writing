<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to prime a stagnant heart for wonder is clear and ties to the underestimated rebel trait, but Mallory’s internal conflict lacks depth in execution; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped in dialogue with Jonah.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between the haunted house and personal reconciliation is logical yet not fully seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of ephemeral gloom is vividly rendered with sensory details like soy and garlic scents, enhancing the setting; the haunted house complements the tone, though its integration with character motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional resonance through metaphors of dough and adaptation, with a satisfying ending; however, subtext about loyalty and tenderness is promising but not fully layered or explored within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like “dough rising,” but some imagery (e.g., “crescent of borrowed moonlight”) borders on purple prose; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like dumplings and adaptation, leaving a lingering thought of renewal; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels more like a limitation than a choice.</comment>
