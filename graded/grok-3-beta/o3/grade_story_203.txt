<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sabine’s stage fright is well-integrated into her role as an exorcist, shaping her internal conflict, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped—her transition from fear to defiance lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly realized and enhances the atmosphere of desolation and renewal; sensory details like the metallic click are evocative, though some descriptions lack variety in tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., orbiting gardens) creates impact, and the theme of rewriting lies into truth is compelling, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., metal as root) feel overextended; emotional handling shows nuance in places but occasionally relies on explicit statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the poetic style, but overall clarity is hindered by occasional overcomplexity in language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
