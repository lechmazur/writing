<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Yorisho's arrogance and doubt are well-portrayed through his actions and dialogue, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict to fully flesh out his motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the climactic singing moment is rushed, and the connection between action and outcome isn't fully logical within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and atmosphere of quiet decay are vividly rendered with strong sensory details like ink as snowflakes, enhancing the mood of shackled potential, though the timeframe "between breaths" feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Yorisho's realization and uses potent imagery like relit lanterns, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of potential, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers some fresh metaphors, the emotional resonance feels somewhat surface-level, with stated rather than shown nuances in Yorisho's transformation; the style is ornate but occasionally overdone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the tapestry and song, leaving a lingering sense of growth, but overly elaborate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
