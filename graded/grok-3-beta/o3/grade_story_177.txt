<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's rebellious nature and unique role as an obituary-writer for the living are intriguing, but motivation lacks deeper personal stakes beyond the abstract goal of restoring art; first-person voice is distinct yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the mask interaction; cause and effect are logical, though some labyrinth choices lack narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the giant's bookshelf is vividly realized with strong sensory details like creaking wood and flickering candlelight; atmosphere of tension amid revolution enhances mood, though timeframe integration feels slightly peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through themes of art versus violence, with striking imagery like "obituary pages fluttering like liberated doves"; ending is purposeful but lacks emotional punch; conflict is clear but resolution feels slightly pat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of writing provisional obituaries, but some metaphors (e.g., "cool as snow and hot as applause") feel overused; tone is consistent, though emotional depth is more stated than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the mask and bookshelf; style is evocative but occasionally overelaborate, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought about art's power, though impact is muted by rushed resolution.</comment>
