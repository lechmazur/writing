<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crispin’s motivation as a broke aristocrat seeking legacy through secret recipes is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the trope of a fallen noble; reactions to the botanical illustration are poignant yet underexplored for emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from arrival to resolution via the roller coaster is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between ghostly demands and memory loss are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone and supports the concept of legacy’s burden; sensory details like “rusting neon ghosts” and “fog ribboned across broken loops” are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (botanical illustration as legacy) evoke thought, and the ending is satisfying; however, the central conflict of memory sacrifice lacks emotional depth, and the theme of harmonizing risk feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors like “rails gleaming like licorice” are fresh, the story leans on gothic tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and some ornate language detracts from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the roller coaster and recipes, but overly complex prose occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering feeling of bittersweet victory, though depth is limited by surface-level character exploration.</comment>
