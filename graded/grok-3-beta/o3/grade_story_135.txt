<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Torhild’s ambition as a brewer is clear, but her deeper motivation to document dying dialects feels underexplored and somewhat disconnected from her trade; her personality lacks a distinct voice despite unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of deciphering bruises driving the quest, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the sudden discovery of the library, strain coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans create a vivid, immersive setting with strong sensory details like “brass lungs” and “snow hissing”; atmosphere supports the peculiar faith tone, though the object-straw connection to setting feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., dialects in bottles) add depth, and the theme of preserving language is compelling, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions; the ending satisfies but lacks profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of brewing dialects into beer is original, some metaphors (e.g., “currents of fate thickened like wort”) feel overwrought; tone is consistent, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative thinking in combining beer and language, but overly ornate style occasionally hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of preservation, though not powerfully.</comment>
