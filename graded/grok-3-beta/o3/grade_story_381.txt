<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters Veyla and Orren have distinct traits (hushed necromancer, selenologist with a casual cap), but their motivations feel underdeveloped and their reactions to events lack depth; their shared love for old movies feels more like a quirk than a driving force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with mapping as the goal, but the resolution feels abrupt and the pacing uneven; the sound of resolve as a concept drives the narrative, yet its integration sometimes feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with strong sensory details (neon ghosts, glowing stalactites), enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motivation, slightly unbalancing the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity through its unique premise and imagery (cave as coauthor, celluloid necromancy), but the emotional impact is muted by underdeveloped characters; literary devices are strong, though the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original take on necromancy and cave mapping, some metaphors (e.g., mineral parliament) feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally veers into overcomplexity, and the lingering impact is diminished by a lack of emotional depth.</comment>
