<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mateo Cruz's steadiness as a gravedigger is evident in his calm response to betrayal and ritualistic actions, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped beyond this trait; motivation to preserve rituals is clear but lacks personal stakes or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (Mateo's journey), middle (confrontation and ritual), and end (resolution), but pacing feels unevenâ€”rushed at critical emotional beats; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Aztec temple and cemetery setting blend surreal and ancient elements effectively, enhancing the mood of overlapping worlds; sensory details like "raucous silence" and "neon glass" are evocative, though some descriptions feel overly abstract and less grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a haunting emotional response through imagery and the theme of preservation, with strong use of metaphor ("worlds kissing"); however, the ending feels slightly unresolved, and dialogue from Dr. Lira lacks natural depth; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of mysticism and technology, some metaphors ("gravitic syllables") feel ornate and forced; emotional resonance is attempted but often stated rather than shown; tone is consistent but borders on purple prose, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the magnifying glass and overlapping worlds, leaving a lingering sense of collision over preservation; however, overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
