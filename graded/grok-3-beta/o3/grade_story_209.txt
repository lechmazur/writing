<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map abandoned railways is clear and tied to familial loss, but Alder's deeper personality and "artfully messy" trait feel underexplored beyond surface description; lacks distinct voice in actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning (loss), middle (quest), and end (confession), but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; cause and effect of using echoes for coordinates strains logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Radio wave garden setting is vividly described with evocative sensory details like "metallic lilies" and "ghost broadcasts," enhancing atmosphere; tone of despairing cheer aligns well with setting, though object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through confession and loss, with strong imagery like "forgiving fireflies"; subtext of guilt and redemption is present, but ending feels more poignant than fully satisfying; conflict resolution is abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining radio waves and heirlooms, but metaphors like "veins beneath scarred earth" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present in confession but often stated rather than shown; tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the hairbrush and radio garden, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; length feels like a limitation, not a choice; lingering impact is moderate but not profound.</comment>
