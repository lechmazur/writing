<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ildra’s meekness and sincerity are well-integrated into her actions, especially in her apologetic nature toward bones and her gentle approach to the tapestry, but her motivation to recover a lullaby feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the unveiling of the tapestry and Ildra’s resolution, but the pacing feels uneven; the buildup to the riddle’s solution is rushed, and the connection between her method and the outcome isn’t fully logical or convincing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with sensory details like phosphorescent stalactites and playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone, though the setting’s connection to the dew drop method feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance through Ildra’s quest for simplicity and uses striking imagery like “motes settling like forgiving dust,” but the ending lacks a stronger punch, and the central conflict feels understated for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on a necromancer’s gentleness, some metaphors (e.g., “death is merely ink spilled from time”) verge on purple prose, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable mystic tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the broken pen and tapestry, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of simplicity, though not powerfully so.</comment>
