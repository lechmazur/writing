<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal tragedy and vigilance is clear, but the orchardist’s personality feels somewhat overshadowed by ornate metaphors, diluting a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and some cause-effect links (like the peacock pattern revelation) strain believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the paper airplane facility is vividly rendered with sensory details like the scent of cardstock, enhancing atmosphere, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (peacock tail, orchard parallels) adds depth, but emotional resonance is uneven due to over-telling of feelings like vindication; ending is satisfying yet not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in combining elements like orchards and paper airplanes, but some metaphors (e.g., “rot deserves sunlight”) feel slightly overused; tone is consistent, though emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally leans toward over-complexity, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
