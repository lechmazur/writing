<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Galatea's "brainy observer" trait is evident in her analytical approach, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped; her reactions to the doll reveal curiosity, yet her distinct voice is muted by descriptive narration over personal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of enforcing curiosity driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between art and discovery are somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the mood of mystery, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels underexplored; atmosphere supports the tone of awkward elegance well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its theme of strength in weakness, with strong imagery and symbolism, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional depth is more told than shown; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., "whispered louder than quasars") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuance, and the style occasionally veers into ornate prose, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about vulnerability, but overly descriptive language sometimes hinders clarity; the brief length feels deliberate but slightly constrains depth.</comment>
