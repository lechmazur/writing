<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thalen’s motivation to capture the cosmic event is clear and aligns with his monk persona, but his personality lacks depth beyond stoic resolve; Mirva’s cynical warmth is more distinct yet underdeveloped in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the comet’s impact lacks sufficient buildup for coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dimension door repair shop is vividly realized with sensory details like incense and grinding gears, enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of radical change feels underexplored in the setting’s context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors (e.g., comet dust as lantern sparks) are striking, and there’s subtext of trust and loss, but emotional resonance is muted by over-telling of sorrow rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of haunted melodies is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., “wounded bird”) feel generic; tone is consistent, but emotional depth lacks human nuance, leaning on stated feelings over subtle cues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but complexity in language occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of trust, though not profoundly.</comment>
