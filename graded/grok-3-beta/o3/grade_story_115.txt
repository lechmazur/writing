<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quen’s curiosity as a tinkerer drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the grudge and remorse; motivation is clear but not nuanced enough for a distinct voice or complex reaction to the mask.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the wish-filament method strains coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of a nano-scale city is vividly realized with evocative details like dust motes as planets; atmosphere supports remorse and forgiveness well, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sight and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through reconciliation and uses strong imagery (e.g., wish-filaments), but subtext is underdeveloped; ending is satisfying, though central conflict resolution feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original setting and concept stand out, but metaphors like “misaligned cog” feel overused; emotional handling shows nuance in guilt, yet some descriptions (e.g., “dawn-lit ice”) verge on generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought of reconciliation, though depth beyond narrative surface is limited.</comment>
