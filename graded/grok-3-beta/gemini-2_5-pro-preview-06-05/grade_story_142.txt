<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s broke aristocrat status is clear, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped; motivation to reclaim legacy is consistent yet lacks nuanced emotional depth beyond desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is intriguing with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between walking and the coaster’s role is logical yet underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details like ozone and candy floss; the haunted coaster setting enhances the odd tone effectively, though timeframe integration feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes wonder and tension with strong imagery and subtext of legacy; ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance relies more on concept than character depth; central conflict is clear and well-resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in blending elements, with fresh metaphors like “ghost-fire”; however, some descriptors feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of wonder; style supports clarity, but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
