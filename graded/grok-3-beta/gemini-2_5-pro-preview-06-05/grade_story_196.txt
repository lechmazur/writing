<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Kael's shift from apathy to resolve, but his personality lacks depth beyond the tired swordsman trope; internal conflict is stated rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the meteor shower pursuit lacks grounding in the plot's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery setting is evocative and complements the tone of quiet resignation, enhanced by starlight imagery; however, sensory details are sparse beyond visuals, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imagery like "ashes stirred" and "unlocked link" adds subtext, and the ending feels purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings rather than showing through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of following meteor showers is unique, the story leans on familiar "weary warrior seeks purpose" tropes without subversion, and some metaphors feel generic rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a lingering sense of purpose, and the brief length feels deliberate, but overall impact is diminished by lack of emotional depth and reliance on familiar narrative patterns.</comment>
