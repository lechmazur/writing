<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation as a candy sculptor with a vendetta is clear, and his rage shapes his initial actions, but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuance in the shift from hate to shame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc from vendetta to revelation, driven effectively by the trail of photographs; pacing is managed well within the word limit, though the ending’s resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like rot and rebellion, enhancing the atmosphere of scorn and loss; it strongly supports Silas’s motivation, though the rebellion timeframe could be more distinctly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Silas’s transformation and the symbolic galleon, with strong imagery and subtext about forgiveness; however, the central conflict’s resolution lacks the depth needed for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining candy sculpture with rebellion, and the twist of Vorlag’s kindness subverts expectations; yet, some emotional descriptors feel stated rather than shown, and the style occasionally borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creatively integrated elements, leaving a lingering thought about forgiveness; however, the brief length slightly limits depth, and the style, while evocative, doesn’t fully elevate it to top-tier status.</comment>
