<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows promise with Elara’s guarded nature and fierce ambivalence shaping her isolation and actions, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the fear of silence is stated rather than deeply felt through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a clear arc within the word limit, with gathering driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some descriptive passages slow the momentum, and the resolution, while impactful, arrives abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glacial orchard and crevasse setting are vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the tone of dour amusement and isolation; however, the connection between setting and object (safety pin) feels tenuous.</comment>
