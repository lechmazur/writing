<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's portrayal as a bluffing swindler is convincing, with clear motivation to expose the Council's lies, but his "energetically lethargic" attribute feels underexplored in action and dialogue, missing depth in personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the terminal's activation driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the dropped book and the broader truth-revealing goal lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is vividly realized with sensory details like rustling leaves, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and hope, though the timeframe's impact on mood feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity about the truth Kael seeks, with effective symbolism in the blank price tag, but the dialogue occasionally feels staged, and the emotional resonance is surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, metaphors like "poison served in honey" are somewhat clich√©d, and Kael's emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, giving a slightly formulaic impression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the terminal's restart, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is moderate due to uneven emotional depth.</comment>
