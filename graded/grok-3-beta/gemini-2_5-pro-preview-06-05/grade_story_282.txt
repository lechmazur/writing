<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting of the discount store at closing time is evocatively described with sensory details like dust motes and linoleum, enhancing the atmosphere of forgotten dreams, though the connection to the timeframe feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of nostalgia and defiance through strong imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by an overreliance on telling rather than showing Kael's inner world; the ending is satisfying yet lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
