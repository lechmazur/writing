<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thaddeus’s portrayal as an unhinged zealot is vivid and drives his actions, particularly in the intense uprooting of the orchid, but his motivation wavers between genuine faith and performative doubt, lacking full consistency in emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the uprooting action providing a clear turning point, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax and overly dense in descriptive detours, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor in the jungle is exceptionally evocative, with sensory details like humidity and chittering enhancing the suffocating atmosphere; however, the connection between the setting and the bottle cap feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bottle cap as idol) and subtext around faith and doubt create impact, with a satisfying ending, but the emotional resonance is undercut by occasionally overt exposition rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers an original take on faith and vulnerability, with fresh metaphors, but some sensory details (e.g., “wet, screaming sound”) border on overwrought, and the tone shifts slightly, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the bottle cap and jungle, leaving a lingering question about faith, but overly dense language occasionally obscures clarity and impact.</comment>
