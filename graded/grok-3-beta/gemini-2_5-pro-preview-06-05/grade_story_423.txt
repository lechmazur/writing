<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelan’s earnestness as a knight is evident in his disciplined approach to mapping, but his deeper personality and inner conflict remain underexplored, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the mapping action driving a logical progression to revelation, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arid desert and ruined aqueduct vividly contrast with the icy motivation, enhanced by strong sensory details like “merciless hammer” sun; however, the greenhouse atmosphere could tie more directly to the celestial theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective imagery (e.g., “ghosts of forgotten blossoms”) and a satisfying ending create impact, with subtle subtext about decay and renewal, but emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the mapping of tears is an original method, the story leans on familiar quest tropes without subversion; metaphors like “sun as a hammer” feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative use of the map and greenhouse, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and depth beyond the narrative arc feels limited.</comment>
