<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's whimsical nature is evident in his choice of fortune-tellers, but his deeper emotional complexity and personal stakes feel underexplored, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at the end, with the crowd's reaction underdeveloped, weakening the resolution's impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining whimsy with doom, but some metaphors (e.g., artistâ€™s brush) feel slightly forced, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length slightly hampers emotional depth.</comment>
