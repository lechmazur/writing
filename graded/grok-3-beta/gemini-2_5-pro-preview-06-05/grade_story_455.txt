<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's disgruntlement and motivation to defy past ghosts are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the surface trait; reactions to coins and shadow patterns feel mechanical rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the signal and corroboration, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the story lacks a fully satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret courtyard and mysterious tone enhance the spy narrative; sensory details like the clink of coins are evocative, but the atmosphere could better reflect Elias's internal scars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its spy elements and subtle symbolism of scars, but the emotional impact is muted; it shows more than tells, yet lacks a lingering thematic depth or memorable style.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is somewhat original, metaphors like "ghosts laid to rest" feel overused; emotional handling is nuanced at times but often stated, and the tone is consistent yet not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like shadow patterns, but it doesn't fully transcend the brief length; it leaves a faint lingering question about Elias's past, yet lacks profound impact.</comment>
