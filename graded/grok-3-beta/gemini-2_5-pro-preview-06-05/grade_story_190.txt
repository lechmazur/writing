<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to master empathy through cold analysis is intriguing and consistent, but the "cautious smuggler" trait feels underexplored in actions; first-person voice is distinct but lacks deeper emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning (setup), middle (data collection), and end (prediction), but pacing feels slightly rushed; action of predicting drives the story, though logical flow is occasionally disrupted by dense imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of Drought Prediction Center enhances the thematic drought in personal and planetary terms; sensory details like the hum of machines are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes intellectual curiosity over emotional response; symbolism of the butterfly and musical memories adds depth, but ending feels more calculated than satisfying; central conflict is present but subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like "museum of my mind," but emotional handling feels overly analytical, lacking human nuance; some descriptors are generic, and tone wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements; brief length suits the clinical tone, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; lingering thought is present but not deeply resonant.</comment>
