<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation to map railways as a proxy for grief is clear, and the hairbrush reveals emotional depth, but his personality lacks distinctiveness, and his actions feel more driven by plot than character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc from purpose to collapse, with the short-circuit as a pivotal moment, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between mapping and emotional resolution is slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is evocatively described with sensory details like metallic air and humming, enhancing the desolate tone, though the water tower’s integration feels utilitarian rather than atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes grief effectively through subtext and imagery, with a satisfying emotional resolution, but the central conflict is understated, and the writing occasionally leans on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a personal take on loss, some metaphors (e.g., “spent current”) feel slightly generic, and emotional expression borders on predictable without enough nuanced subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with some creative interplay, leaving a lingering sadness, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
