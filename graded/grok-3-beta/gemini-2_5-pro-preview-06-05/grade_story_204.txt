<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s role as a professional cuddler is intriguing and ties into his motivation to combat loneliness, but his internal conflict and prejudice feel underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper insight into his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the chance encounter and the hangar scene lacks sufficient grounding, making the progression somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly described with evocative imagery of decay, enhancing the atmosphere of forgotten ambition, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias’s internal shift, with decent use of symbolism (phantom punch), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of breaking prejudice lacks deeper subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise of a professional cuddler and a Construct relationship offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., “metallic vines”) feel familiar, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the phantom punch, but the brevity hampers depth, and the style, while competent, doesn’t fully elevate the narrative to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
