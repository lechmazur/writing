<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Kael's rashness as a protector is evident in his near mishaps with the box, but his deeper personality and voice remain underdeveloped; motivation for solace is stated but lacks nuanced exploration through action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between the cavern's howl and the postcards’ significance is intriguing yet underdeveloped, leaving cause and effect somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and howling caverns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like the "resonant song of stone and air"; the mystical tone complements the setting, though the connection to Kael’s motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity with the postcards as invitations and the cosmic hum, supported by some effective imagery; however, the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks depth or resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story offers originality in the concept of postcards as cosmic invitations, with fresh metaphors like "nebulae washed ashore"; yet, emotional nuance is limited, often stated rather than shown, and some descriptive language borders on overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the postcards and fortress, leaving a lingering question about the cosmos; however, the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, and style occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>
