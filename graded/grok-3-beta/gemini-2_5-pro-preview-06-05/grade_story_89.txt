<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The variable star observation deck is evocative and ties well to the tone of cosmic mystery, but sensory details are sparse, and the cloud-watching timeframe feels underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response with its theme of forgotten memory, and symbolism of the nail is strong, but the lack of dialogue and limited character depth reduces overall impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the nail and capsules, leaving a lingering thought of revolution, but the brief length feels more constraining than deliberate, limiting deeper exploration.</comment>
