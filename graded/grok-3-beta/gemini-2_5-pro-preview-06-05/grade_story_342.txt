<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with sensory details like the lull before rain and twisted orchard, strongly supporting the tone and concept; however, some setting elements feel ornamental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the release of memories and uses potent imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a lingering theme; the ending satisfies but doesn't provoke further reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original in concept with fresh metaphors like the psychic cage, but some generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats (e.g., collective sigh) dilute authenticity; style feels occasionally forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration of memories and setting, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; impact is present but not profound.</comment>
