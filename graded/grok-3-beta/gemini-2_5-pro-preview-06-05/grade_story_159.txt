<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation to solve the labyrinth is clear and drives his actions, but his "earnestly frivolous" attribute feels inconsistently portrayedâ€”his seriousness occasionally overshadows the intended levity, weakening personality depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from betrayal to revelation is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the confetti-coded proposals as a method seem forced, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns creates a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of complex simplicity; however, sensory details are sparse beyond sight, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through the betrayal-as-lesson subtext and uses imagery effectively, but the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining elements like confetti proposals and a kaleidoscope, but some metaphors feel generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, leaning toward stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but the brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate, and the style occasionally obscures clarity with overly ornate phrasing.</comment>
