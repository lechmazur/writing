<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The nondescript seer’s personality is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to unearth truth feels clear but lacks depth or personal stakes. First-person voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, with untangling the data driving a clear progression. Pacing is well-managed, though the connection between the rain scent method and plot resolution feels slightly contrived. Logical flow is mostly maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower setting and post-party hush create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like petrichor. The setting supports the mood and motivation well, though the timeframe’s impact feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue and reflection on justice, with some effective imagery (data as a forest). However, the ending feels underwhelming, and the central conflict lacks emotional weight. Subtext is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of decoding via scent is original, but some metaphors (e.g., data-vines) feel slightly generic. Emotional resonance is limited by stated rather than shown feelings. Style is distinct but occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like scent as a method, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with forced imagery. It leaves a lingering thought on justice, though the brevity feels more restrictive than deliberate.</comment>
