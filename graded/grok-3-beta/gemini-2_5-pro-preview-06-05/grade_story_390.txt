<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meiâ€™s calm demeanor as an assassin is well-portrayed through her unhurried grace, but her deeper motivations and personal stakes remain underdeveloped, leaving her character somewhat surface-level despite a distinct presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of amalgamating whispers driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague, disrupting full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting and timeframe are vividly rendered with sensory details like rustling robes and chimes, enhancing the atmosphere of intrigue, though the connection between setting and botanical press feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
