<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's reticence is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to dethrone complacency feels abstract and lacks personal stakes or backstory to ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the knock as a climactic action, but the connection between the gathering of echoes and the outcome feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like flickering lanterns and damp air, enhancing the eerie tone and supporting the concept of echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response with its quiet rebellion and pensive mirth, and the imagery of ripples and resonance adds depth, though the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the concept of echoes is unique, some descriptions (e.g., "beautiful decay") feel slightly clich√©d, and emotional nuance is present but not fully fleshed out, risking a generic undertone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the tablet and lanterns, but the brevity slightly hampers depth, and the style occasionally leans toward over-ornamentation.</comment>
