<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s dutiful nature is clear, and her motivation to reveal a forbidden truth aligns with her scholarly background, but her personality lacks depth beyond the rebellion; her voice and reactions feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by the act of contamination, with a clear arc from intent to consequence within the word limit; pacing is well-managed, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The capsule hotel setting for time travelers is vividly realized and enhances the sterile, tense atmosphere; sensory details like the hum and whiteness are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes strong emotion through the poet’s voice and Elara’s sacrifice; imagery and symbolism (wire coil as key) are powerful, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a final punch for deeper reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of sacrifice; yet, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
