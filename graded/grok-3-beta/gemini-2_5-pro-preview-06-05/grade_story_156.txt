<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a thoughtful resolution, but pacing feels rushed at key moments, and the connection between action and concept is occasionally forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing the atmosphere, though the tone sometimes clashes with the boldly timid attribute, diluting emotional impact.</comment>
