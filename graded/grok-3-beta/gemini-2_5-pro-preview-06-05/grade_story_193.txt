<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alaric’s motivation to cure loneliness is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond the exiled prince trope; his transformation feels somewhat abrupt and lacks a distinct voice to fully flesh out his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from isolation to connection is coherent and well-paced within the word limit, with the snowstorm effectively driving the chance encounter; however, the resolution feels slightly rushed, missing deeper exploration of the emotional shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a vivid, isolating atmosphere that mirrors Alaric’s loneliness, enhanced by strong sensory details like the howling wind and cold wood; the tone of familiar unknown is well-sustained, though setting-object connection could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the theme of connection over solitude, with effective imagery like the fire and mortar; however, the conflict feels understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a fresh take on exile and alchemy, some metaphors (e.g., wind as grieving beast) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than nuanced, and the style lacks a truly unique imprint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the mortar and snowstorm, and the brevity feels deliberate; however, it lacks a profound lingering thought or question, settling for a straightforward resolution over deeper complexity.</comment>
