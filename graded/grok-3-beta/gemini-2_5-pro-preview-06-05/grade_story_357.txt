<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to triumph over despair is clear and drives actions, but the "focused collector" trait feels underdeveloped beyond hoarding points; the first-person voice is distinct yet lacks deeper nuance in emotional expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—key emotional beats are rushed, and the board game structure occasionally overshadows narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere of coldness ties to the Frost Giant’s Lair setting effectively, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s integration with character motivation feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (despair as predator) and subtext around solitude creates emotional impact, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like the black rose and predator are fresh, but the narrative leans on familiar internal-struggle tropes without significant subversion; emotional resonance is present but somewhat surface-level in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the board game as a metaphor for struggle, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
