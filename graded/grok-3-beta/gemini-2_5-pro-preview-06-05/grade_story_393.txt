<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, driven by coincidences, but the pacing feels rushed at the tar pit resolution, and some cause-effect links, like the ley lines, are vague and abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like ozone and primordial heat, effectively supporting the tone of desperate hope; the tar pit setting enhances the mystical action, though the suburban contrast is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the coin as a seed and family web, evoking a lingering sense of connection; however, emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing, and the ending feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
