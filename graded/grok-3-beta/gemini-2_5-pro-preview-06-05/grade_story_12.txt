<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn the language of the soul is intriguing but underdeveloped; the aloofness feels surface-level and lacks depth in shaping actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear exchange of destinies, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed emotional transitions undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the futuristic mall is vividly realized and enhances the atmosphere of transience; sensory details like synthetic hum and digital rivers are effective, though some connections to motivation feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional resonance through memory and loss, with strong symbolism in the tile and map; however, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict lacks sharpness within the brief length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping emotions is original, some metaphors (e.g., "coastlines of the human heart") feel generic; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally states rather than shows feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative integration, but uneven pacing and underdeveloped character depth prevent a lingering impact; style supports clarity but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
