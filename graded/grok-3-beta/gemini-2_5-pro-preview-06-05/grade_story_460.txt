<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a reflective resolution, but the action of perceiving feels static, lacking momentum; pacing is slow yet coherent within the word limit, though it borders on meandering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The acid rain forest setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the hiss of rain and toxic sky, enhancing the prickly wonder tone; atmosphere supports the concept of fragmented freedom, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of fragmented wisdom, with fresh metaphors like the ember of choice; however, some descriptions (e.g., "terrifying and beautiful freedom") verge on clich√©, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
