<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve tradition is clear and drives the narrative, but the spiritually secular attribute feels underexplored, lacking depth in shaping personality or actions beyond a single mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with a decisive action (obliteration), but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the coffee stain method, while unique, lacks sufficient grounding in the story's logic, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport baggage claim is evocatively described with sensory details like "rust and forgotten departures," enhancing the melancholic atmosphere and complementing the theme of loss, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes sorrow and clarity through vivid imagery like "fractal sorrow," with subtext about sacrifice, but emotional depth is somewhat surface-level, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining coffee stain divination with sci-fi, but metaphors like "heavy cloak" are clich√©d, and emotional resonance leans on explicit statements over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
