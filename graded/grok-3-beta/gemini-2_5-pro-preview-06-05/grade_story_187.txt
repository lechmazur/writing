<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's stoic nature and desperate motivation are clear, particularly in his determination to save his sister, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; reactions lack nuance beyond the stated tenderness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with nightmares guiding Kael to the confrontation, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a fully satisfying closure within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch's training ground and bland facade create a striking contrast, enhanced by sensory details like chalk dust and damp earth, though the atmosphere could deeper support Kael's inner turmoil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Kael's quest, with decent imagery like "psychic breadcrumbs," but the dialogue feels slightly stiff, and the central conflict's resolution lacks lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of nightmares as a guide is intriguing, some metaphors like "broken glass" voice feel generic, and emotional portrayal leans toward stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the floorboard, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
