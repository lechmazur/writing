<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's timid nature and seraphic demeanor are present, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth in emotional nuance; her actions align with the promise, yet her voice and inner conflict remain underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of overtaking a ghost drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the arcade discovery; coherence is maintained, though the scoreboard revelation borders on contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined temple and post-factory timeframe create a poignant backdrop, with sensory details like dust and decay in the arcade enhancing mood; however, the connection between setting and object feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through its theme of collective healing, with effective imagery like stitching a tapestry; yet, the ending feels more functional than profoundly satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique take on collective healing, some metaphors (e.g., "ghost in the machine") feel familiar; emotional resonance is present but relies partly on stated feelings rather than fully showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of the typewriter ribbon and scoreboard; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a strength.</comment>
