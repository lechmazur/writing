<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue traditions is clear, and the first-person voice is distinct with a poetic, melancholic tone. However, the character's personality and emotional depth remain underdeveloped; their "aggressively kind" attribute feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning (observer's purpose), middle (action via whistle), and resolution (tradition restored). The use of the whale's call as a method is creative but strains logical coherence slightly. Pacing is mostly effective, though the dancer's sudden shift feels abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "salt-stained glass" and the sea's "patient knowledge," enhancing the atmosphere of decay and wisdom. The tone of brazen calm complements the setting, though the connection between the plastic whistle and the setting feels tenuous despite its symbolic role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective emotional response through its theme of preserving tradition, with strong imagery like the whale's call and the dancer's stomp. Subtext about loss and memory enriches the narrative, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch. The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers an original premise with the lighthouse observer and whale's call, avoiding overt clich√©s. Metaphors like "beautiful poison" are fresh, but some phrases, such as "convergence of timelines," feel overly ornate. Emotional resonance is present but relies partly on stated feelings rather than fully shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration of the whistle and whale's call. The style is poetic and supports the narrative, though occasionally verges on overwrought. The brief length feels deliberate, and the lingering theme of tradition's survival adds depth, though overall impact falls short of exceptional.</comment>
