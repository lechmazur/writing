<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn traditional methods is clear and drives the narrative, with the dry-witted voice adding distinct flavor to the first-person narration; however, deeper emotional complexity or backstory for the sentinel is lacking, limiting full investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from crossing off the name to the dance resolution feels complete within the word limit, with logical cause and effect; pacing is mostly effective, though the transition to dancing feels slightly abrupt and could be better grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom is vividly realized with sensory details like cold wood and salt-scented dust, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; the setting strongly supports the tone, though more tactile or auditory depth could elevate immersion further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through the dance with a ghost, with satisfying symbolism in the crumbling rope; the ending resonates, but the central conflict feels understated, and subtext could be more layered to prompt deeper reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The approach to banishing a spirit via dance is original and avoids clich√©s, with fresh imagery like the "dying candle flame"; however, some sensory details feel slightly generic, and the emotional nuance, while present, lacks the raw unpredictability of true human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the dance and rope, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy; style supports clarity, but the brief length slightly constrains deeper exploration of character and theme, making it feel more vignette than fully realized narrative.</comment>
