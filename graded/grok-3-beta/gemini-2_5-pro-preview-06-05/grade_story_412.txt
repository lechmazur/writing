<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to establish a new order is clear and aligns with her bookish, broken nature, but her development feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; her reactions to the key cover reveal grief, yet her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the broadcast as a climactic action, driven by the concept of secret keepers, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the cause-effect link between nightmares and action is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frequency monitoring station enhances the atmosphere of secrecy and tension, with strong sensory details like the hum of servers, though the connection between setting and object feels more functional than deeply symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes sorrow and triumph, with effective imagery like “captured stars,” but the emotional depth remains surface-level at times; the ending is satisfying, though subtext could be richer within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on secret keepers, some metaphors like “symphony for the end of an era” feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like cyclical nightmares, leaving a lingering sense of triumph and loss, but the style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity, limiting its immediate impact.</comment>
