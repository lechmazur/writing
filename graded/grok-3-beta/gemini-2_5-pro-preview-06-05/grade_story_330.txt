<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sir Kaelan's dejection and transformation to resolve are clear, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the vow; his personality feels more symbolic than human, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution within the word limit, driven by the vow and trident prong, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The zero-gravity dance hall and sacred disorder tone are vividly realized with strong sensory imagery, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the connection between the sunken realm and setting feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of purpose and mystery with strong imagery and subtext, and the ending is satisfying; yet, the central conflict feels more abstract than visceral, and emotional depth is shown but not deeply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the concept and setting are original, some metaphors (e.g., "coffin for his spirit") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but stated more than nuanced, and the style occasionally borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style sometimes obscures clarity, and the lingering impact is notable but not profound.</comment>
