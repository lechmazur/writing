<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to cut through illusions is clear and drives actions, but Lord Alistair’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond bitterness; lacks distinct voice or nuanced depth in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, and fortifying as an action drives tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect of the combustion lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Spontaneous combustion lab setting enhances the tone of hollow recklessness and supports the action; sensory details of heat and light are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a melancholic reflection on truth via symbolism of ticket stubs, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings; ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like “paper barricade,” but some phrases feel overly ornate, and emotional handling occasionally lacks nuance, relying on stated bitterness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like ticket stubs and drone, but brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; leaves a thought on truth, though not profoundly lingering.</comment>
