<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with a thirst for ruin tied to past tragedy, but the orchardist background feels underutilized in shaping personality beyond patience for patterns; voice is distinct but reactions lack deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, driven by the conspiracy reveal, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between personal tragedy and action could be more explicit within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the hangar as a drone nest is evocative and enhances the conspiracy theme, with strong visual details of shimmering wings, though sensory immersion beyond sight is minimal, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes intrigue and intellectual satisfaction through the conspiracy reveal, with effective symbolism in the peacock pattern, but emotional impact is limited by surface-level grief; ending is purposeful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the peacock pattern as encryption, a fresh metaphor, but some phrasing feels formulaic, and emotional portrayal leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the peacock pattern, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and emotional depth is lacking, reducing lasting impact despite clever construction.</comment>
