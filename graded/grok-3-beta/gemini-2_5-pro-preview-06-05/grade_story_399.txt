<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s grumpiness and role as a crypt caretaker are well-integrated into his internal conflict, but his motivation, while clear, lacks deeper specificity beyond the abstract "uprising within," limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent within the word limit, with a discernible shift from resentment to realization, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing a fuller exploration of the transformative moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The witch’s crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like the scent of moon-herbs; however, the connection between setting and object feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response through its metaphor of trauma as a sand mandala, with strong subtext and symbolism, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a final emotional punch to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the metaphor of grains of sand for trauma is fresh, some descriptive language borders on overwrought ("civil war of the soul"), and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the sand mandala, leaving a lingering reflection on trauma, but minor stylistic excesses and a slightly abrupt resolution prevent it from reaching top-tier impact.</comment>
