<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair's submissive nature and perceptiveness are well-integrated into his actions and motivations, particularly in his decision to protect the creature; however, his internal shift to action feels slightly underdeveloped given his established passivity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit with a logical cause-effect progression, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the accidental spillage as a method of action strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The manor's grounds and secret workshop setting effectively contrast Alistair's mundane duties with the covert tension below; sensory details like clanking sounds and acrid fumes enhance immersion, though some atmospheric depth is sacrificed for plot movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes empathy through Alistair's quiet rebellion and offers subtle symbolism in the creature's plight; the ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels slightly caricatured, and deeper thematic exploration is constrained by length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and shows a unique blend of earnestness and flippancy, but some descriptive language (e.g., "frightfully serious") feels formulaic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated parallels than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, though not fully optimized; it leaves a lingering sense of quiet triumph, but overall impact is muted by minor inconsistencies in tone and depth.</comment>
