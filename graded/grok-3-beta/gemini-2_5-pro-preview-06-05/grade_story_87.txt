<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to bury an old hatred is clear and drives Eliasâ€™s internal conflict, but his "patient librarian" trait feels underexplored in action or voice, lacking depth beyond a surface-level calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from rage to hollow victory is complete within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between mixtape method and burial action lacks logical depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk dining hall is vividly described with sensory details like steam and clockwork, enhancing atmosphere, though its connection to the memory and motivation feels incidental rather than integral.</comment>
