<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation to make peace with his past is clear, and his shaky hands as a former mercenary reflect a haunted personality, but his inner conflict lacks deeper exploration; reactions to the amber are poignant yet surface-level, missing nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the search driving the story to a quiet resolution; pacing is managed well, but the connection between rumors and the Curator feels slightly convenient, lacking tighter cause-and-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artist’s haven is vividly realized with sensory details like shattered glass and murals, enhancing the tone of longing; however, the timeframe of the echoing hour feels underutilized, missing a stronger atmospheric tie to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the amber’s connection to Kael’s brother, with effective symbolism in the trapped spider; yet, the ending feels slightly underwhelming, lacking a deeper thematic punch or lingering subtext beyond the surface reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a personal take on loss, some metaphors (e.g., “vibration of a held note”) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the style lacks a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, it lacks a profound lingering impact or creative spark in combining elements, settling for competence over brilliance.</comment>
