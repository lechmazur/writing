<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's naivety as a gambler is clear, but his deeper personality and voice feel underdeveloped; motivation is present but lacks nuance beyond a generic desire for a final win.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the action of docking the candle drives the story, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like roaring wind and spray, enhancing the atmosphere of desperation, though the connection between setting and candle feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes an emotional response with the fleeting victory of the flame, and the ending is purposeful, but dialogue lacks distinctiveness, and some subtext remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (e.g., "liquid wall") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on explicit description than nuanced showing; overall style is individual but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of bittersweet triumph, but it lacks the depth and polish needed for top-tier publication; brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
