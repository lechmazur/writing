<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's grogginess and brewer identity are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to embody values feels vague and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct personal voice beyond surface-level flippancy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the cleansing action driving a logical progression, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper cause-effect exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting enhances the encroaching darkness concept effectively, with strong sensory details like dust and decay, though the protest timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its resolution, with decent imagery like the mirror shard, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable uniqueness; the central conflict is clear but resolved too simplistically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While not overly formulaic, the story leans on familiar haunted mansion tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like "slug in salt" are serviceable but not striking, and emotional nuance is limited to stated determination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mirror shard, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped themes; it leaves a mild lingering defiance, though style occasionally hinders deeper clarity.</comment>
