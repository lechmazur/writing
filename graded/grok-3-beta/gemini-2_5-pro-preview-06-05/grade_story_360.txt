<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s meekness and sincerity as a necromancer are evident, but her inner transformation lacks depth; her motivation to decode the universal riddle feels stated rather than deeply explored through actions or nuanced voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city and glowing fungus gardens are vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the mystic tone; however, the playground sounds feel slightly disconnected from the deeper atmospheric shift.</comment>
