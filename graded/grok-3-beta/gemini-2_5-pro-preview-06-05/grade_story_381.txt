<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to map the caves is clear, but his "hushed" nature as a necromancer feels underdeveloped and doesn't distinctly shape his actions or voice beyond a general reticence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of domination evolving into connection; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the cause-effect of the cave's response could be more explicitly grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like "humming energy" and "glittering quiet," enhancing the futuristic nostalgic tone and supporting Kael's struggle, though the connection between setting and object (baseball cap) remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the connection with the cave's ghost, and the use of old movie references as subtext is clever; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks deeper thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story shows originality in blending necromancy with futuristic tech and nostalgia for old movies, avoiding overt clich√©s; yet, some descriptors (e.g., "immense, glittering quiet") feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance could be shown more than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the cave and movie references, leaving a lingering sense of connection; however, the style occasionally leans toward over-explanation, slightly hindering clarity and depth.</comment>
