<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hive-mind therapist's motivation to anchor the ephemeral is clear and drives the narrative, but the character's personality lacks depth or distinct voice, feeling more like a functional device than a nuanced entity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the draining action and the bold discovery at dawn remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret agent training facility and nighttime setting effectively enhance the eerie, introspective tone, with strong sensory details like flickering candles and wax pools, though the atmosphere could tie more directly to the agentsâ€™ mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet melancholy and uses evocative symbolism (wax as regret), but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by a lack of deeper character connection, and the ending feels more clever than profoundly satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original take on regret and psychic therapy, with fresh metaphors like the "sound of hindsight," though some descriptive language borders on ornate, and emotional nuance occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style sometimes prioritizes imagery over clarity, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
