<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Brother Tenzin's stubbornness is evident in his relentless pursuit of truth, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced layers beyond the singular goal of avenging a stolen life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the action of avenging, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of the climactic realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The aerial gondola setting and mountain imagery create a vivid, enchanting atmosphere that complements the cautious tone and enhances Tenzin's introspective journey; sensory details are evocative but could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Tenzin's clarity at the end, with effective symbolism in the flute, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict resolution feels slightly underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of analyzing tooth marks is original, the narrative leans on predictable themes of revenge and twin rivalry without fully subverting them; metaphors are fresh but emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the flute and shipping label, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity limits deeper impact or lingering questions.</comment>
