<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's reckless nature and motivation to map ghost towns are clear and drive his actions, but his internal shift toward vulnerability feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper backstory to fully ground the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; the connection between Kael’s past promise and current decision could be more causally developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned funfair in a misty forest is vividly rendered with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of decay and introspection, though the timeframe of a resurfacing promise feels slightly underexplored in the setting’s context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kael’s realization and uses effective imagery like the Ferris wheel as a monument to broken things, but the dialogue from street musicians feels somewhat inserted rather than organic, and the theme of wise choices could be more subtly woven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on a hunter of forgotten places, some metaphors (e.g., “map of sorrows”) border on cliché without subversion, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than fully shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the vintage camera lens, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans ornate, and the lingering impact is somewhat diminished by an underdeveloped emotional core.</comment>
