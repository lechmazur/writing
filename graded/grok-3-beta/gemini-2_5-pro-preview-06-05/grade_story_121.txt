<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to unify conflicting hearts is clear and drives the narrative, but the "shifty caretaker" trait feels underdeveloped and lacks specific actions or voice to fully embody shiftiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (parole hearing), middle (tailing caravans), and end (crystal formation), but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between actions and outcomes is occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of anguished joy is effectively conveyed through vivid sensory details like “moth-eaten velvet tents” and the abandoned drive-in setting, enhancing mood, though the surreal caravans feel slightly disconnected from the grounded setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional response through the fractured crystal metaphor and deeper subtext of imperfect unity, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying punch due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining surreal elements with personal grief, and metaphors like the crystal are fresh, but some phrasing (e.g., “anguished joy”) feels slightly overused, and emotional nuance could be shown more than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of bittersweet freedom, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity at times.</comment>
