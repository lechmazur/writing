<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and implied end, driven by the act of corroding authority; pacing is well-managed within the word limit, though subtle triggers in the speech feel slightly forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground orchard with bio-luminescent fungus is vividly described and enhances the secretive, subversive tone; sensory details like the orchestra tuning are effective, though the setting's connection to sandals feels tangential.</comment>
