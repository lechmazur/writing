<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to pen cosmic verse on skin is intriguing and aligns with the repressed poet archetype, but Elian's personality lacks depth beyond this singular drive; reactions and voice feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from spontaneous decision to the act of writing, with a clear arc within word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect of the stranger's presence is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Overgrown city street enhances the mood of wildness and decay, complemented by sensory details like damp earth and ozone; atmosphere supports motivation, though setting’s connection to timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cosmic verse as permanence against void) and evocative imagery create impact, but emotional resonance is undercut by lack of deeper character conflict; ending satisfies but lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Concept of writing on skin is original, with fresh metaphors like “forgotten starlight,” but some descriptors (e.g., “terrifying calm”) feel predictable; emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, and brief length suits the fleeting moment, but style occasionally leans ornate, obscuring clarity; leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
