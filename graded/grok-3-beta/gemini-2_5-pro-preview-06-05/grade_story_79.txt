<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sheriff Brody's character is adequately shaped by his small-town roots and ghostly resolve, with clear motivation to find solace through poetry, but his inner conflict lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice, feeling somewhat archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, tracing Brody's quiet rebellion, but the action of tracing falling stars feels more symbolic than propulsive, and pacing is slightly uneven with a rushed emotional shift at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library and midday lull create a striking, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details like "buttery shafts of light," enhancing the tone of quiet grief, though the setting's connection to the chain feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through imagery and metaphor (e.g., dirge vs. single note), with a clear theme of grief's anatomy, but the impact is diminished by a lack of deeper subtext or a truly resonant ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While some imagery (e.g., "fleeting scar of light") is fresh, the story leans on predictable grief tropes without subversion, and emotional handling feels more stated than shown, lacking the raw nuance expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive feel with creative use of elements like the library and falling stars, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more constraining than deliberate, limiting depth.</comment>
