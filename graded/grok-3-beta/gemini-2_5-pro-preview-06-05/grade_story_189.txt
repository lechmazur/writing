<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's bright-eyed nature and brazen calm are evident, but her deeper personality and emotional nuance remain underdeveloped within the word limit; motivation to decode the star maps is clear but lacks personal stakes or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc from mystery to revelation; overcharging the capacitor drives tension effectively, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper buildup due to word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-water-war timeframe create a vivid, desolate atmosphere; sensory details like ozone and vibrations are strong, though the ghosts’ presence feels underexplored as a setting element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes hope through its terraforming twist and offers some symbolism with the lighthouse as renewal, but emotional depth is limited by 'telling' over 'showing'; the ending is satisfying yet lacks profound subtext or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in reinterpreting star maps as terraforming schematics, but relies on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion; language is clear but lacks distinctive style or nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the phone booth key, but brevity limits depth; style is functional yet not striking, and while the ending hints at renewal, it doesn’t fully provoke deeper reflection.</comment>
