<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyraâ€™s impulsiveness and performer nature shape her actions, particularly in the climactic tackle, but her deeper personality lacks distinctiveness; her motivation is clear but feels somewhat surface-level without nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of tackling driving a dramatic climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between tracking shooting stars and the fortress is tenuous, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory detail (roaring water, damp flagstones), enhancing the restless tone, though the dusk timeframe adds little unique texture to the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through the theme of inherited justice, with effective imagery (celestial command, caged energy), but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and dialogue is minimal and lacks naturalness; conflict is present but resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of tracking shooting stars offers originality, some metaphors (bruised sky, crumbling deception) feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable quest structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with most elements serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering sense of justice but lacks profound depth.</comment>
