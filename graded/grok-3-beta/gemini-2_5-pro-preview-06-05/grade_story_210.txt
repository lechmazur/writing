<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Alistair Finch's amiability is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to fuse lore and science is clear, but his personality lacks distinctiveness or depth beyond the scholarly archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the concept of resonance drives the story, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like vibrations and creaking timbers, enhancing the mood, though the timeframe connection to "waiting room" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes intellectual curiosity and has a satisfying ending, with effective metaphors like "library of whispers," but lacks emotional depth or a stronger central conflict; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of resonant memory is intriguing, some metaphors feel slightly generic ("ocean of time"); emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and the style, though competent, lacks a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about history and science, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
