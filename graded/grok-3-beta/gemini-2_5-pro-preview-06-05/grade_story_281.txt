<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Finn's motivation to challenge the status quo is clear, but his transformation from pickpocket to spectral conduit lacks depth in backstory or emotional grounding, making his actions feel slightly unconvincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with poetry as a method driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection to the mayor at the end is abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with sensory details like rust and humming silence, enhancing the eerie tone, though the timeframe "between appointments" feels underutilized in shaping atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (e.g., "scorching poise") create impact, and the theme of remembrance is evident, but emotional resonance is limited by Finn's underdeveloped inner conflict; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers an original premise with poetry as a ghostly conduit, but relies on familiar haunted setting tropes without subversion; some metaphors are fresh, though others (e.g., "shedding skin") feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like poetry and the dummy, leaving a lingering sense of purpose, but uneven character depth and rushed pacing hinder overall polish and readiness for top-tier publication.</comment>
