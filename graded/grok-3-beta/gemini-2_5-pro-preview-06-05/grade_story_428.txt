<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear in seeking to undermine a corrupt system, but the transition from city planner to doomsday prepper lacks depth; emotional nuance feels surface-level, and the 'voice' is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed; the action of debasing the deal is logical yet underexplored, and coherence suffers from abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ancient Indian temple setting is evocative with strong sensory details like "cool sandstone floor," enhancing mood; however, the timeframeâ€™s integration feels slightly forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (broken constellations, ink blotter) add depth, and the ending is purposeful; yet, emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining esoteric elements with urban planning, but metaphors like "ghost in the machine" feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, and brevity seems deliberate; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and lingering impact is moderate due to limited emotional depth.</comment>
