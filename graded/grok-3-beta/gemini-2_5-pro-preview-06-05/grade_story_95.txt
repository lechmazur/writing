<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alistair’s motivation to learn forgotten languages is clear and consistent, driving his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond weariness; the “timidly loud” attribute feels underexplored in shaping his voice or behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; connections between action and concept are logical yet not deeply impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm chasing headquarters setting is evocative and enhances the tone of forgotten dances, with strong sensory details like swirling monitors, but the connection between setting and object (buttons) feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the lullaby’s warmth and uses metaphors like “forgotten dance” effectively, but the central conflict is understated, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a profound lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of tracking linguistic ghosts is original, and metaphors are fresh, but emotional resonance relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; the narrative style, while distinct, borders on ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone, but overly poetic language occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a subtle lingering thought but not a powerful one.</comment>
