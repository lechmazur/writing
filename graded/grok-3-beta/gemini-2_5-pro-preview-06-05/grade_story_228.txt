<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition as an herbalist is clear and drives her actions, but her inner struggle with “not enough” feels slightly overwrought and lacks deeper nuance in such a short piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear crisis and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the sudden storm as a catalyst is somewhat predictable within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bunker setting is vividly described and enhances the oppressive atmosphere, with sensory details like vibrations and red strobes, though the connection between setting and object feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the clothespin, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
