<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Finn’s “strongly weak” attribute is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; his exhaustion overshadows his mental sharpness, and his motivation to track social changes feels detached from personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the levitation climax, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between tracking urban legends and the resolution lacks depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reimagined Celtic village and atmospheric details like ozone and damp earth are evocative, enhancing the tone of jubilant despair, though the setting’s connection to the ink pot feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response with Finn’s transformation, and symbolism of levitation is strong, but the theme of courage feels stated rather than shown, limiting deeper impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the ink pot and levitation, leaving a lingering sense of balance, but stylistic flourishes occasionally hinder clarity and emotional resonance.</comment>
