<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's motivation to discover non-violence is clear and shapes his actions, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond the insomnia and empathy, lacking a distinct voice or deeper nuance in reaction to the haunting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a subtle arc within the word limit, with a beginning (sleeplessness), middle (method of confessions), and end (near-sleep), but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between confessions and the ghost’s pain could be more logically fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway setting work evocatively with the tone of empty abundance, enhanced by sensory details like dust motes and train screeches; however, the atmosphere could more directly tie to the botanical samples for deeper cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through its theme of shared sorrow, with strong imagery like “iron veins” and a satisfying ending, but the conflict feels understated, and the subtext of non-violence lacks sharper impact or layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clichés and offers a unique approach to haunting via empathy, with fresh metaphors like “wilted prayers”; yet, some emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, and the style, while distinct, occasionally borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like confessions and whispers, leaving a lingering sense of fullness, but the style sometimes prioritizes imagery over clarity, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
