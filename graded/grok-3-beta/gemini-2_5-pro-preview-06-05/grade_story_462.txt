<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape mental confines is clear, but Elias lacks depth beyond exhaustion; reactions to mirrors and stained glass reveal little unique personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a reflective resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the tapping sign drives progression, yet the buildup to the epiphany feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like the clang and coastal wind; the abandoned house of mirrors enhances mood, though setting-tone connection to motivation could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (cradle of sparks, mirrors as doorways) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is muted by overt telling of feelings; ending is purposeful yet lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows style with metaphors, but some phrases (e.g., “barren soil of psyche”) feel overused; emotional handling leans on stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they occasionally feel forced; style supports clarity, though brevity limits depth; lingering thought is present but not striking.</comment>
