<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character motivation to map migration routes is clear, but the conscientious objector background feels superficially tied to actions; personality lacks depth beyond sly malevolence, and voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between mapping routes and fatal traps feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed ending and over-explained motives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the storm-battered orchard is evocative and supports the mood of malevolence, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere aligns with motivation but lacks richer immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional resonance or subtext beyond surface malice; imagery is present but not striking; ending feels predictable rather than satisfying; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Writing shows some style but relies on clich√©s like "howling winds" without subversion; metaphors are generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired; brevity feels limiting, not deliberate; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
