<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; cause and effect between prophecy and actions are logical yet lack nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned space freighter docking bay and timeframe of colliding worlds create a vivid, immersive atmosphere; sensory details like echoing boots stand out, though some descriptions are overly ornate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with themes of liberation, but reliance on explicit states like "cheerless ecstasy" weakens impact; imagery is strong, yet subtext remains shallow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by familiar tropes of isolated guardians and prophecies; language occasionally dips into purple prose, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style leans overly complex, hindering clarity; depth is present but not fully resonant due to rushed execution.</comment>
