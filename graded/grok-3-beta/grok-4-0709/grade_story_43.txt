<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's "loudly introverted" trait is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation for reunion with courage feels vague and reactions to the CD lack depth, missing a distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; meandering action drives the story weakly, and cause-effect links are muddled by overwritten descriptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Neon cathedral setting is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the timeframe and character motivation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with decent imagery and symbolism (CD as courage), but lacks subtext depth, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overuse of flowery metaphors and generic descriptors ("crooked hope") detracts from originality; tone shifts slightly, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with creative elements, but style often obscures clarity with ornate language; lacks a lingering depth or question beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
