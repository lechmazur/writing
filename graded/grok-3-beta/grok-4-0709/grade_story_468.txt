<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity as a mortician drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation is clear but feels one-dimensional, missing nuanced internal conflict or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the connection between imitation and plot progression feels contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and dawn timeframe are vividly described with strong sensory details like "golden embers," enhancing atmosphere; however, the setting’s connection to the bracelet feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept is somewhat original, metaphors like "rustle of revelation" feel forced and repetitive; emotional depth is stated rather than shown, and the tone shifts slightly, lacking consistent style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but overly ornate language hinders clarity; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with lingering questions lacking depth.</comment>
