<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elaric's meekness and sincerity are portrayed consistently, shaping his introspective nature, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the surface-level riddle-solving, and his reactions to the broken pen feel more symbolic than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of regaining necromantic essence driving a resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the riddle and the dew drop epiphany lacks sufficient buildup for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly described with sensory details like bioluminescent fungi and playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone, though the connection between setting and the dew drop method feels somewhat incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elaric’s quiet triumph, with decent use of symbolism (tapestry, broken pen), but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension or layered subtext within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a meek necromancer in a goblin city shows originality, some metaphors (e.g., “fractured bone”) feel overused, and the narrative leans on stated insights rather than nuanced emotional showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a strength, leaving the impact somewhat shallow.</comment>
