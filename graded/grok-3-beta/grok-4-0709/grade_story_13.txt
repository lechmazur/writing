<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to track evolutionary changes is clear but lacks depth; solemnity feels surface-level, not deeply integrated into actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete within word limit, with a logical trail of poems, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between poems and discoveries are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the toppled clock tower and shifting sands creates a vivid atmosphere of decay and urgency, enhancing the tone, though sensory details are sporadically applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (sands erasing time, evolving garden) add depth, but emotional resonance is weak due to 'telling' over 'showing'; ending is purposeful but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining poetry with a quest, but language veers into purple prose with overly ornate phrases; emotional nuance is stated rather than felt, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but style occasionally hinders clarity with florid descriptions; length feels like a constraint, not a choice, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
