<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to confront fear is clear, but Alex's personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "carefully careless" trait; reactions to the situation lack depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the silent agreement's impact on the plot feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the haunted mansion is vivid with sensory details like "loud silence" and "bleeding twilight," effectively supporting the tone, though the setting's connection to the blood drive method feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes unease and has subtext about complicity, with decent use of imagery, but the ending lacks a strong emotional punch; dialogue is sparse and lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like carnivorous plants and blood drives, but metaphors like "vines twisting like serpents" are overused; emotional depth feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with creative use of elements, but the short length exposes underdeveloped aspects; it leaves a lingering unease, though style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing.</comment>
