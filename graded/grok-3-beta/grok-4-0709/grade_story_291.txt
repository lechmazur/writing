<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to confront prejudice is clear, but Eliasâ€™s daring nature feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes his reaction to reflections; his voice is indistinct with minimal dialogue to showcase personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "overlook" feels forced into the narrative, and pacing suffers from overly dense exposition, disrupting logical flow at key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted mirror maze setting enhances the eerie tone and ties well to the concept of distorted prejudice, with strong sensory details like "rust and forgotten laughter," though the timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story has a central conflict, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of prejudice rather than showing nuanced reactions; ending feels abrupt and lacks satisfying resolution, despite some evocative imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the premise shows potential for originality, the execution leans on predictable tropes of haunted reflections and ghostly judgment, with generic descriptors and overly ornate language detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style often hinders clarity with dense prose; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, leaving little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
