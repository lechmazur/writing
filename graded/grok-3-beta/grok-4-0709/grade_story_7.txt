<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to cross sacred boundaries is clear, and the attribute of being "expectantly resigned" shapes a unique tone, but the sentient doll collector lacks depth or distinct voice beyond the assigned traits, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the action of upholding the chorus driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and some cause-effect links between star paths and the resolution are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the nectar collection facility is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the ethereal tone, and the timeframe before the first prayer complements the atmosphere, though the object's connection to the setting feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism around boundaries and healing are effective, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by a lack of subtext or deeper character nuance; conflict resolution feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining elements, some metaphors like "forgotten dreams" feel generic, and the tone shifts slightly with overly ornate language at times, hinting at formulaic tendencies; emotional resonance is present but not fully nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the scope, but style occasionally overreaches with complexity, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
