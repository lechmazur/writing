<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elandorâ€™s hesitation and awkwardness are present but underdeveloped; they shape actions minimally and lack depth in revealing internal conflict or growth. Motivation to restore systems is clear but feels imposed rather than organic to his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of emerging driving a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax. The concept of bridging worlds shapes the narrative, yet cause-effect links are superficial, lacking nuanced progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a vivid, unique setting that enhances the atmosphere of tension and isolation. Sensory details like steam and snow are evocative, though the timeframe feels tacked on and tone of rancor is inconsistently sustained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with world-bridging symbolism, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing. The ending resolves the conflict but lacks resonance; writing style is competent yet lacks a distinctive voice or memorable craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of hermit crab shell-moving offers originality, the narrative leans on fantasy tropes without subversion. Metaphors are somewhat fresh but occasionally generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion despite numerous elements, but they often feel forced into service rather than naturally integrated. Creative thinking is evident in the setting, yet overall impact is limited by lack of depth and lingering resonance.</comment>
