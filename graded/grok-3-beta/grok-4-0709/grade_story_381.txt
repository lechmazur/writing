<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The necromancer’s hushed nature and motivation to map cave systems are clear, but the character lacks depth beyond surface traits and nostalgia; Elias feels like a plot device rather than a fully realized entity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the action of dominating the caves lacks tangible stakes or progression; coherence suffers from abrupt shifts to nostalgic tangents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave setting is vividly described and complements the futuristic nostalgia, but sensory details are uneven, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character’s motivation, lacking consistent emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through nostalgia and resolve, but emotional impact is diluted by telling over showing; dialogue is purposeful yet not fully natural; the ending lacks a strong, satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality in blending necromancy with futuristic nostalgia, the execution relies on predictable tropes of past-meets-future without subversion; metaphors like "neural networks" feel generic, lacking fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; the short length feels like a constraint, not a deliberate choice.</comment>
