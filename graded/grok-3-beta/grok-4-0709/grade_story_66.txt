<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s portrayal as a quiet deserter is somewhat effective, with his past influencing his silent demeanor, but his motivations lack depth and specificity, feeling more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven, and the connection between actions like carbonizing masks and the central theme is not fully coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting of a plant communication study is vividly realized with sensory details like soil-scented air, enhancing the atmosphere, though the integration of the timeframe with the setting feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elias’s journey, and symbolism of masks and mirrors is present, but the impact is diminished by a lack of nuanced conflict and an ending that feels more stated than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, lacking lasting depth.</comment>
