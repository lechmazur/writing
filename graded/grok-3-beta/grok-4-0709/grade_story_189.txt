<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode star maps is clear and aligns with her literal-minded trait, but her personality lacks depth beyond this attribute; her reactions and voice feel somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the overcharging action driving tension, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links, like the sudden stabilization, are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement and post-war timeframe create a compelling atmosphere that supports the tone and motivation; sensory details like creaks and mists are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder at the cosmic reveal, but relies heavily on telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels purposeful yet lacks deeper emotional resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the concept of star maps and ghosts offers some originality, the execution leans on genre tropes without subversion; metaphors like "fireflies in gloom" are generic, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, with creative intent evident, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
