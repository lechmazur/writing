<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's apprehensive nature is evident and ties to her motivation to rescue truth, but her character lacks depth beyond this trait; her voice and reactions feel somewhat generic and predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between actions and outcomes occasionally lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center and borrowed dawn tone mesh effectively, creating a vivid synthetic atmosphere; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of truth and compassion, with decent use of symbolism (candle as truth), but dialogue feels slightly stiff, and the conflict resolution lacks a punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the cyberpunk setting and thematic elements show originality, some metaphors (e.g., "virus in the system") are overused, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
