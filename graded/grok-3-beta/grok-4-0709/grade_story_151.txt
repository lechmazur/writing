<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's awe as a defining trait is intriguing, but his inner conflict and motivation feel underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to resolution is clear, with the action of cultivating driving the narrative, though pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and icy, emotionless timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like groaning ice floes, though the setting's connection to the veil feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through hope's return, with strong imagery and symbolism (veil, snowflake), but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the theme of revival lacks deeper subtext exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique premise and avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (shattering like a snowflake) feel familiar, and the rational-organic blend occasionally leans toward overly logical exposition over human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
