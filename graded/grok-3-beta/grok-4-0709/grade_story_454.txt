<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jax's recklessness as a smuggler is evident, and his motivation for acceptance is clear, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; the rationally emotional attribute lacks nuanced exploration in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action to dramatize, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the map's tear as a plot device is symbolically heavy-handed without sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted funhouse setting is vividly described with eerie atmosphere complementing the tone of jubilant despair; however, sensory details are occasionally generic, missing deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Jax's loneliness and quest for belonging, with decent use of symbolism (torn map, clover), but the impact is dulled by overt telling of emotions rather than showing; the ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on predictable smuggler tropes without subversion; metaphors like "symphony of coordinated chaos" feel overused, and emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of synchronized alarms, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength; lacks lingering depth.</comment>
