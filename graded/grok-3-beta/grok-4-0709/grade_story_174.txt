<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around regret is clear but lacks depth; Elias's personality as a theoretically creative fireworks designer feels underexplored in action and voice, missing nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced in resolution; pacing is rushed at the end, and the connection between frost patterns and fireworks lacks logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with frost and waterfall imagery, enhancing mood, but sensory details are uneven, and the hidden library feels disconnected from the initial setting's realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some emotional resonance in regret and imagery of fireworks, but subtext is shallow; ending feels convenient rather than earned, and conflict resolution lacks tension or depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality in combining frost patterns with fireworks is notable, but reliance on familiar regret trope and overly ornate language detracts; emotional handling feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with elements but feels built around them rather than organic; style is occasionally overwrought, and depth is limited, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
