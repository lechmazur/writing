<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters Elias and Lila are distinct, with motivations tied to their past neglect, but their development feels surface-level; solemnity and irritation are present but not deeply explored through nuanced actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of x-ing out driving a resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like accessing the neural network) lack grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of a cyberpunk rooftop garden is vivid and enhances the theme of connection amidst isolation; sensory details like neon and drone hums are effective, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of reconnection, with some effective imagery (glowing apples), but dialogue feels functional rather than natural, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the cyberpunk setting and orchardist concept show originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of isolation and digital reconnection without significant subversion; metaphors are somewhat generic, lacking freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative spark; style is clear but not striking, and brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
