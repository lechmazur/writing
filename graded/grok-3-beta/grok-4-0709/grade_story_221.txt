<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details and supports the melancholic tone, but its connection to wreck-diving feels forced and underutilized in enhancing the action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some metaphors (e.g., insect in amber) are fresh, but others are generic; emotional handling leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing, and the tone shifts slightly, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinct flair, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
