<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lir's skepticism shapes his irreverent approach, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; the transition from doubting magic to challenging an immortal lacks depth in emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The slingshot action drives the plot cleverly, and the story maintains a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, undermining the resolution's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The disappearing ink factory setting enhances the vanishing theme and complements the tone of irreverent awe, with strong sensory details like hissing vents; however, the midday mailbox hush feels tacked on and underutilized.</comment>
