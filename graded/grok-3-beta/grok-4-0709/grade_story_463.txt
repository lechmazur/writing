<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s dry wit and sentinel role are present, particularly in dialogue, but his motivation to learn traditional methods feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional depth; his personality doesn’t fully shape his actions with the rope or dance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of confiscating the locket driving the resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between eroding promises and the tango method is tenuous, lacking logical depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom setting is evocatively described with salt-crusted walls and ghostly whispers, enhancing the mood of eroding promises; sensory details are strong, though the timeframe’s integration feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mira’s release and Elias’s triumph, with decent imagery like “waves gnawing at stone,” but the ending feels abrupt, dialogue is sparse, and deeper themes of regret or duty remain surface-level without significant subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the tango as a method offers a unique angle, the story leans on gothic tropes without subversion; metaphors like “dying lantern light” feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, showing some creative integration like the rope and dance, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a faint lingering mood but lacks profound depth or clarity in style.</comment>
