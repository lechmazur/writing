<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between overhearing calls and redefining family feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The parallel universe beach is vividly described with reverse waves and glowing sand, enhancing the surreal tone, but sensory details are sparse beyond visuals, and the diner setting feels underutilized in supporting the mood.</comment>
