<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's secretive nature as a pathfinder is evident, but his motivation to preserve folk medicines feels underexplored beyond surface-level defiance; reactions to the teapot lack deeper personal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the hacking of playlists as a method feels contrived; pacing is uneven with rushed resolutions and abrupt supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is evocative with strong sensory details like creaking tunnels, but the atmosphere inconsistently supports Elias's motivation, and the teapot's connection to the setting feels forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a forgotten prodigy in a haunted park offers some originality, the execution relies on predictable supernatural tropes; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style often obscures clarity; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
