<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s selflessness is clear, but her motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes beyond longing; her voice is indistinct, missing nuanced dialogue or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the convergence event lacks buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and centuries-long timeframe mesh well, creating a haunting atmosphere; sensory details like the warped record’s sound are evocative, though some descriptions lack variety in tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes longing and isolation, with some effective symbolism via the record, but the emotional depth is surface-level; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a truly resonant punch or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of mapping via music is unique, the execution relies on overused sci-fi tropes of isolation and transcendence; metaphors like “savage grace” feel repetitive and somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, obscuring clarity; it leaves a lingering sense of sacrifice but lacks deeper impact.</comment>
