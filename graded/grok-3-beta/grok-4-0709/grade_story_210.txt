<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Elias Thorne's amiability is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to fuse lore with modern dreams feels stated rather than deeply felt, lacking nuanced emotional depth in his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the signal arrival as resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between crossword-solving and the larger quest remains tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly described with sensory details like creaking timbers and flickering lamplight, effectively enhancing the mood of mystery, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has potential for emotional resonance and uses symbolism (lighthouse as beacon/grave), but the impact is diluted by overt telling of concepts like "navigating shadows" rather than showing through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery (timbers vibrating with stories) is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of haunted settings and scholarly rebellion without significant subversion; emotional depth feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the crossword and lighthouse, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
