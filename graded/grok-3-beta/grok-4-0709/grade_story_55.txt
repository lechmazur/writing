<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirian’s romantic doom is mentioned but not deeply explored; motivation to preserve craft techniques is clear but lacks emotional depth or specificity in how it ties to his personal scars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear goal and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the bell’s echo and archive awakening are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The utopia design studio setting is intriguing and complements the timeframe, but sensory details are sparse, and atmosphere only partially supports Lirian’s motivation, lacking vivid immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (e.g., keys unlocking past) are effective, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; ending is purposeful but not striking, and conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows creativity, overuse of flowery language like “raucously silent” feels forced; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and metaphors are occasionally generic, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and depth beyond the narrative is limited, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
