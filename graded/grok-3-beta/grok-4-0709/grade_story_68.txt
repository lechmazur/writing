<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alex's moral code as a hacker is clear and drives his mission to restore dignity, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; reactions and voice feel somewhat generic despite consistent motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; connections between elements are logical, though the method of deciphering inscriptions feels contrived within the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman marketplace is vividly rendered and enhances the action, with tea-steeping timeframe adding subtle tension; sensory details like misty dawn are evocative, though some connections between setting and objects feel forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with Lucius's humanization and has a satisfying ending; imagery like tea steam is effective, but subtext is limited, and conflict resolution feels somewhat surface-level within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique blend of historical and digital elements, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors are generic; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the style lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
