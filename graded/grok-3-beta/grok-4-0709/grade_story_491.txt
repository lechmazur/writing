<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to find wisdom is clear, but the serene fisher's personality feels underdeveloped; serenity is stated but not deeply shown through actions or unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; unraveling the quilt as a method fits, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining illusion and extinct flora, but metaphors like "still waters" feel overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally leans ornate, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though depth feels constrained by brevity.</comment>
