<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to chronicle social movements is clear but feels detached from personal stakes; the anxiously calm attribute is inconsistently reflected in actions and lacks depth in portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the confrontation at the bridge drives the story but pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution undermining impact within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the inverted waterfall and celestial dance is vividly described with strong sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere, but connection to character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in imagery but leans on ornate language and predictable regret tropes; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements but feels forced in places; style is ambitious yet overcomplicated, and brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
