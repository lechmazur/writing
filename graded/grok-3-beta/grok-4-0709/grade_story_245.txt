<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as an irate smuggler seeking redemption is clear, but the internal conflict feels surface-level, lacking deeper psychological nuance or distinct voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the tea leaf method as a plot device seems forced and insufficiently justified.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is evocative with strong visual decay, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the emotional weight of the motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through loss and resolve, but symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) feels heavy-handed; central conflict is present but lacks depth in resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "heart's revolt" are overused and lack freshness; emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but integration feels mechanical at times; style is clear but lacks distinctive flair, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
