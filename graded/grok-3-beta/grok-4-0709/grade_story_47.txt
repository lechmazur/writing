<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s dutiful nature and eager cynicism are portrayed with some depth, but his motivation feels inconsistently realized, lacking a compelling personal stake beyond abstract musings on mortality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the glove, voice notes, and resolution feels forced, with pacing rushed at the end, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is evocative and enhances the tone of graceless beauty, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the glove and phones feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts subtext with mortality as a punchline, but the emotional impact is muted by overwritten metaphors; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance due to shallow conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of reframing mortality shows originality, the execution leans on predictable existential tropes without subversion, and some metaphors feel generic rather than fresh or nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative awkwardly; the style is ambitious yet overcomplicated, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
