<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, and the method of photographs in candy is intriguing, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is evocative and ties to the tone of rebellion, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully enhance Elias’s motivation or the concept of anonymous kindness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through betrayal and revenge, with decent symbolism in candy sculptures, but lacks deeper subtext, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the candy sculptor concept is unique, the narrative leans on familiar revenge tropes without subversion, and emotional expression often feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brevity exposes a lack of depth, leaving little lingering impact or thought.</comment>
