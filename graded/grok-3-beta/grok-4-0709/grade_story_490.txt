<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the caravan repair station and post-flood timeframe are evocative and support the mood, with strong sensory details like salty puddles; however, the atmosphere's connection to the characterâ€™s motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "feasting greedily" feel slightly overused; emotional handling leans on explicit statements rather than nuance; tone is consistent but lacks a truly unique style or surprising twist.</comment>
