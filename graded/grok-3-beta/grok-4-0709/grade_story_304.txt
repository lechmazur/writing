<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias’s desire for a new beginning, but his personality feels underdeveloped beyond the assassin archetype; reactions lack depth, and the “lurking” trait doesn’t distinctly shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc from setup to climax within the word limit, but the spider web method feels contrived and pacing stumbles with overly descriptive interludes that disrupt tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly described with evocative imagery, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting’s connection to character motivation feels tangential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with dawn imagery and subtext of rebirth, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending lacks resonance, feeling more abrupt than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the setting and metaphor of the spider web, but writing leans on flowery prose and generic descriptors; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style often hinders clarity with ornate language; length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and lingering impact is minimal.</comment>
