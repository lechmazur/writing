<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the poltergeist conflict and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the sudden path closure as a method feels slightly contrived within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of youthifying a spirit is creative, the story leans on familiar exorcist tropes without significant subversion, and some descriptors feel generic rather than uniquely vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they sometimes feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks the polish or depth for a lasting impact.</comment>
