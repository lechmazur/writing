<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elias's awkwardness is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice or nuanced motivation beyond the surface goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc; the action of fusing elements drives the story but feels repetitive and unresolved, with pacing that drags despite the word limit due to over-description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic imagery, but lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying ending; it tells rather than shows emotions and misses a compelling central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overwrought prose and generic metaphors like "storms in every soul"; lacks human nuance in emotion and relies on predictable speculative tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style often hinders clarity with excessive ornamentation, missing lasting depth or impact.</comment>
