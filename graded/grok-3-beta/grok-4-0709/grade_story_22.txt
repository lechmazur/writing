<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The portal-strewn canyon is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the artifact feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style often hinders clarity with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
