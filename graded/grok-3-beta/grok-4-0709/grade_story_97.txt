<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s fact-minded nature and transition to empathy are depicted with some depth, but her motivation feels slightly inconsistent; her "desperately casual" facade lacks nuance in execution, making her voice less distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of recomposing the map drives the story, but pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, and some cause-effect links are underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The unstable dimension and whispered minute timeframe create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the action, though sensory details are sparse and inconsistently evocative, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara’s transformation, but over-reliance on telling rather than showing emotions weakens impact; imagery is present but not always striking, and dialogue feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of empathy in an unstable dimension offers originality, the execution relies on familiar transformation tropes without subversion; emotional handling lacks subtlety, and some descriptors feel generic rather than vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they occasionally feel forced rather than organic; the style supports clarity, yet the short length feels like a constraint, limiting depth and lingering impact.</comment>
