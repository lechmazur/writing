<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to wed logic and madness is clear, but Eamon's "dazed" state feels under-explored and lacks depth in shaping his actions beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the action of retooling stories drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The composer's sound garden is vividly realized with sensory details like chiming reeds and echoing fountains, strongly supporting the atmosphere and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story prompts thought with its logic-madness theme and uses evocative imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced character reaction; ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of blending science and folklore is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "cosmic dance") feel overused; writing shows style but occasionally slips into ornate prose detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style sometimes prioritizes flourish over clarity; it leaves a lingering idea, though depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
