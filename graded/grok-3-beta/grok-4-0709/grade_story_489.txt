<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The unseen observer's aggressively kind nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to rescue traditions feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the whistle's fling and the resolution feels tenuous and lacks clear cause-effect logic; pacing is uneven with a rushed climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is evocative and ties well to the tone of brazen calm, with strong sensory details like salt-crusted glass; however, the setting's connection to the dancer and whale call feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story has moments of impact through imagery and symbolism (whistle as wisdom vessel), but the emotional resonance is shallow, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying or lingering punch; conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution relies on familiar ghostly tropes without subversion; metaphors like "crashing waves" are generic, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
