<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear, but his personality as "theoretically rebellious" feels underdeveloped and lacks distinct voice or depth beyond surface defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of translation drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and some cause-effect links are vague within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a vivid, eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of deliberate wilderness, though the settingâ€™s connection to the pressed flower album feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of renewal, and imagery is effective, but the ending lacks a deeper punch, and the conflict feels understated with limited subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality in combining elements, some metaphors (e.g., comet as harbinger) are generic, and the writing occasionally leans into overly ornate language, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style sometimes hinders clarity with overwrought phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
