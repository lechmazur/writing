<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's uptight nature is well-defined through his meticulous actions and starched demeanor, and his motivation to cradle empathy in steel is intriguing, but the transformation feels abrupt and lacks deeper insight into his internal struggle, making his emotional shift less convincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the analysis of adhesive driving the mystery forward, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the light bulb and empathy transformation is underdeveloped, leaving coherence strained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The witch's greenhouse and gravestone hill create a vivid, eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details like nightshade scent and creaking glass, enhancing the tone of buried optimism, though the setting's connection to the light bulb feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elias's transformation, with some effective symbolism in the light bulb, but the ending feels forced, and the writing leans on telling over showing, particularly in describing empathy, diminishing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of merging Tesla's invention with witchcraft is original, the execution relies on predictable transformation tropes without subversion, and some metaphors like "arms of steel" feel generic, lacking fresh nuance or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements like the greenhouse and light bulb, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impression.</comment>
