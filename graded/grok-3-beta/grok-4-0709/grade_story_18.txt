<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s telepathy shapes her actions effectively, and her motivation to uncover truth aligns with her nature as a living statue; however, her personality lacks depth beyond the tragic-joyful dichotomy, and her 'voice' feels muted without distinct dialogue or internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action of weatherizing drives the plot, and the method of calligraphy is logical within the steampunk context; the story achieves a clear arc within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and minor coherence issues arise with abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly realized with sensory details like hissing gears and fog, enhancing the gloomy tone and action; however, the connection between the setting and the threadbare hair tie feels tenuous, slightly undermining atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response with its theme of truth amid deception, and imagery like “ink on parchment” is effective; yet, the emotional depth remains surface-level, relying on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the steampunk setting and telepathic statue offer some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of hidden truth and noble sacrifice without subversion; metaphors like “coal furnace” feel generic, and emotional handling lacks subtlety, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent in combining telepathy and calligraphy; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, obscuring clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
