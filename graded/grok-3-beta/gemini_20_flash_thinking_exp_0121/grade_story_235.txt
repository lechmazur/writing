<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The herbalist’s motivation to connect with the student through subtle floral messages is intriguing but underdeveloped; his personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits, and his voice is indistinct due to the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of repositioning flowers feels repetitive and lacks significant progression or resolution, leaving the narrative somewhat static and incoherent in impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Japanese castle as an art school is evocative and complements the tone of distant intimacy, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the herbalist’s motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its poetic intent, with some effective symbolism in the pressed flowers, but the lack of conflict or resolution diminishes impact, and the writing often tells rather than shows emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of celestial-guided floral messages is original, the execution relies on overly ornate language and repetitive phrasing like "dramatically subtle," suggesting formulaic tendencies; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style leans toward overwrought prose, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
