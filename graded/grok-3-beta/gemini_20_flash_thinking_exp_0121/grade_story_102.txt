<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Bartholomew's "spineless" nature is mentioned but not convincingly shown through actions or decisions; his motivation to hush a prophecy feels vague and lacks depth, failing to align strongly with his mercenary trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the action of mentoring is underdeveloped, and the connection between the beginning and the cryptic ending feels forced and incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly described and complements the tone of luminous doubt, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the character's motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with "silence speaks louder than the storm," but lacks emotional impact or a satisfying resolution; it tells more than shows, diminishing storytelling craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases like "luminous doubt" and "grandly trivial" feel forced and formulaic; the narrative lacks originality, relying on predictable mystery tropes without subversion or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion despite assigned elements; the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
