<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the action (outmaneuvering) and the method (flame dance) feels contrived; pacing is uneven, with overly descriptive passages slowing the tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ghost story recording booth setting enhances the eerie tone and complements the concept of ancestral wisdom; sensory details like the red light and soundproofing are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
