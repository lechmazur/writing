<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Karim's weariness as an undertaker is evident, and his motivation to hold onto hope is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond desperation; his actions align with tribal knowledge, yet his voice and nuanced traits remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of imprisoning darkness driving the narrative, but the method of following sun paths feels underexplained and the pacing slightly rushed, lacking a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Persian palace setting is evocative and complements the tone of placid ferocity; sensory details like the hush and stone surfaces enhance atmosphere, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a faint emotional response through Karim's quiet defiance, with some effective imagery around the clock and shadows, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels purposeful yet incomplete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the metaphors and sensory details are somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a truly distinctive style or surprising twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with the assigned elements, showing some creative integration, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with repetitive phrasing; the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice.</comment>
