<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but the unseen observer lacks depth or distinct voice; their actions feel dictated by plot necessity rather than personal traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the whale’s call, the dancer’s step, and the whistle’s purpose feels contrived and lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the haunted lighthouse is evocative with strong sensory details like salt and moonlight, effectively supporting the tone, though the setting’s link to the whistle feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with the undercurrent of wisdom, and imagery is occasionally striking, but emotional impact is muted by over-explained concepts and a lack of nuanced conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like the whale’s call and whistle, but reliance on abstract language and generic descriptors like “deep wisdom” undermines authenticity; tone shifts feel unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but style often obscures clarity with overwrought phrasing; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking lasting impact.</comment>
