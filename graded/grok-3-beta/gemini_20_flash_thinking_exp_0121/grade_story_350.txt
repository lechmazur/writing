<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias's primal urge to uncover hidden truth, but his personality as a back-alley puppeteer feels underdeveloped and disconnected from his actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reaction to objects and methods.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but connections between elements like the wedding gown and stamp album feel forced; pacing is uneven, with rushed revelations undermining coherence and logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ancient Greek temple is evocative and supports the tone of alone intimacy, but sensory details are sparse; connection between setting and objects like the stamp album feels tenuous, missing deeper integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Some originality in linking stamps and gown tears, but metaphors like "symphonies of truth" feel overused and vague; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative leans on predictable introspective patterns.</comment>
