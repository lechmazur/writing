<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's solitary nature and fiercely gentle attribute are reflected in her actions, but her motivation feels somewhat vague and lacks depth in execution; her internal struggle is stated rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of resuscitating her art feels more conceptual than grounded, with pacing that occasionally drags due to overwrought descriptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing the atmosphere, but the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous at times, lacking deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through imagery and theme of artistic revival, but the overuse of metaphor borders on purple prose, and the conflict feels more abstract than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style leans toward over-elaboration, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a particularly profound one.</comment>
