<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Nefertari's fretful nature and hesitantly bold curiosity are mentioned but not deeply explored; her motivation to see the world through unfiltered eyes feels surface-level and lacks nuanced development within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or resolution; the connection between the photograph, recipe, and subtitles feels forced and incoherent at times, with pacing that rushes through key emotional shifts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles with cohesion among its many elements, feeling more like a collection of ideas than a unified narrative; it lacks the depth or lingering impact expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
