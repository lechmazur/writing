<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the connection between the locket and her past lacks depth, making her actions seem more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the counterattack via candy photographs, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between the rebellion and the hidden continent is vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of scorn and decay, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere of rebellion and loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of memory and betrayal, with some effective imagery in candy sculptures, but lacks emotional resonance due to telling over showing; the ending feels more setup than resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of candy as rebellion is original, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable vengeance tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but feels constrained by its length rather than deliberately concise; it leaves a lingering question about the continent, yet lacks the depth for a lasting impact.</comment>
