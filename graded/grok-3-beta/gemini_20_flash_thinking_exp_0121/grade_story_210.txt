<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dr. Alistair Finch's amiable nature is present but underdeveloped; his motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams feels stated rather than shown through distinct actions or voice, lacking depth in personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or central conflict within the tight word limit; the connection between beginning and end feels vague, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on atmosphere over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly described with sensory details like wind and timber vibrations, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting overshadows character and plot, lacking balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (timbers as storytellers) add depth, but emotional impact is muted; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, and the theme of past-future fusion lacks sharp focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of haunted settings and scholarly quests without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with no strong lingering impact.</comment>
