<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Wren's streetwise nature is evident in her navigation and instincts, but her motivation to "harvest hope" feels vague and underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the brooch as a catalyst, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the brooch and the temple's purpose lacks clear cause-and-effect grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lost orchard temple is vividly described with sensory details like overripe fruit and dappled sunlight, enhancing the mood, but the "unwritten calendar" timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected from the setting's impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of reversed patterns is intriguing, the story leans on repetitive phrases like "confident uncertainty" and generic descriptors, lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional depth, suggesting a formulaic undertone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
