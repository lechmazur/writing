<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s naivety and gambling background are present but underdeveloped; her motivations shift without deep exploration, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the candle mold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between the beginning and end is tenuous, and the concept of unspoken bargains drives the story inconsistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is evocative with sensory details like the turbine whoosh, but the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of desperation; candlelit dinners feel slightly disconnected from the technological backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue but lacks emotional depth; imagery and symbolism (e.g., candle mold as promise/curse) are present but not fully impactful; the ending feels more ambiguous than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable gambling metaphors and lacks truly fresh perspectives; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the style feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; the style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
