<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The arrogant swordsman’s doubtfully confident nature is portrayed with some nuance, particularly in the flicker of uncertainty in his eyes, but his transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth in motivation beyond a generic desire to “deliver a spark.” His voice and actions via song are distinct but not fully aligned with a well-rounded personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the song driving a transformation in the tapestry, but the action of “authorizing” feels vague and disconnected from a concrete conflict. Pacing is uneven, with the buildup to the climax feeling rushed, though the beginning and end are tied together thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard is evocative and supports the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse beyond dust motes and stone walls. The setting enhances the mood of quiet potential, yet its connection to the tapestry and action feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the swordsman’s song, and the tapestry’s transformation carries symbolic weight, but the impact is diminished by repetitive phrasing and a lack of subtext. The ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying, and the central conflict remains too abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on predictable themes of hope and transformation without fresh subversion. Metaphors like “shackled potential” feel generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions. The style lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style is neither strikingly clear nor complex. It leaves a faint lingering thought of hope, yet lacks the depth or creativity to stand out in a competitive market.</comment>
