<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jebediah's motivation to spark curiosity is clear, but his "virtually peculiar" nature feels underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions beyond surface oddity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's connection between the misaligning action and the observatory's crisis is logical, but pacing feels rushed, and the resolution lacks a definitive arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory dome is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing atmosphere, but the setting's connection to the coffee shop walls feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of coffee shop walls as oracles is original, the narrative leans on steampunk tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than evoked through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
