<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the morphing action driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between the lamp and tickets lacks deeper logical grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like the lamp and carnival tickets, but some descriptions are generic, and emotional resonance feels surface-level rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering idea of redemption but lacks profound depth.</comment>
