<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas’s grumpiness is evident, but his internal shift from irritation to confronting trauma feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in motivation; his voice is distinct but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the connection between jiggling the tube and activating the mandala feels contrived; pacing is uneven, with the resolution rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The witch’s crystal scrying room is evocative and ties to the tone, but sensory details are sparse; the atmosphere supports the theme of trauma, though inconsistently executed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Silas’s trauma, but relies too much on telling over showing; symbolism of the mandala is intriguing yet underdeveloped; ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of trauma manifesting as unrest is unique, the execution feels formulaic at times with generic descriptors; emotional handling lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; it leaves a faint lingering thought, not a strong impact.</comment>
