<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Unit 734's overzealousness is present but underdeveloped; motivation to catch the goddess's echo feels vague and lacks emotional depth, even with the notebook's discovery. Actions align, but the character lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to revelations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot progression feels uneven within the word limit; the notebook discovery drives the story but lacks a clear resolution or arc. Pacing is rushed at times, and cause-effect links between clues and goddess echo are tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The urban orchard on a repurposed overpass is vividly described and complements the timeframe, enhancing the liminal atmosphere. However, sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the goddess echo feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on lineage and forgotten magic, with some effective imagery (plum blossoms, rustling leaves). However, the conflict is underdeveloped, the ending lacks impact, and emotions are often told rather than shown, reducing depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a post-human orchard and goddess echo is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable discovery tropes. Metaphors are occasionally fresh but lack consistent originality; emotional nuance feels stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic. Style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate. Lingering impact is minimal due to unresolved tension.</comment>
