<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as an insomniac poet is intriguing, and his motivation to dismantle violence through non-violence is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond this singular drive, and his voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between confessions and non-violence feels underdeveloped, and pacing is uneven with overly dense introspection slowing the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting and timeframe are evocative, with strong sensory details like dust motes and train rumbles, but the atmosphere only partially supports the character's motivation, feeling more decorative than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some thought through its exploration of non-violence, with decent use of symbolism (botanical samples as confessions), but the ending lacks punch, and the writing occasionally overexplains rather than shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, metaphors like "whispers' warnings" feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, with a tone that shifts unevenly between poetic and prosaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style often feels overwrought, and the brief length exposes gaps in emotional depth rather than showcasing deliberate restraint.</comment>
