<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn traditional methods is clear, but the dry-witted attribute feels underdeveloped and does not distinctly shape personality or dialogue; reactions to the rope lack depth in revealing character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of confiscation drives the story but lacks a fully satisfying resolution; pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively haunting with strong sensory details like salt and moonlight, enhancing the setting; however, the connection between the haunted bedroom and the timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through symbolism of the rope and promises, but subtext is shallow; dialogue is minimal and lacks impact; central conflict is present but resolution feels forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining dance and binding spirits, but relies on predictable gothic tropes without subversion; metaphors like "tattered memory" feel generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
