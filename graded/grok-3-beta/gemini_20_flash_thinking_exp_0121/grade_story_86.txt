<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Anya’s apprehension is clear, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the connection between her past and present actions lacks depth, making her personality somewhat generic despite the distinct setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the action and the concept of compassion is tenuous, lacking strong cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cyberpunk data center is vividly rendered with sensory details like the hum of servers, effectively contrasting with the candle’s fragility; however, the timeframe’s integration feels vague and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the candle’s symbolism, but the theme of compassion feels forced rather than organic; the ending is purposeful but lacks a deeper, lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the cyberpunk setting offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of digital heists and truth-seeking without subversion; metaphors like “borrowed dawn” are evocative but not entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it lacks a truly lingering thought.</comment>
