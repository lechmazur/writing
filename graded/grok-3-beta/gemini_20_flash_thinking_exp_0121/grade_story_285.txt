<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael's awkwardness is present but underdeveloped, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions beyond surface-level hesitation. Motivation to restore tradition is clear but feels generic, not uniquely tied to his personality or the postcard. His voice is indistinct, with no standout traits in narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of emerging feels vague and lacks concrete progression. The hermit crab method is intriguing but poorly integrated, feeling more symbolic than practical. Pacing is uneven, with repetitive focus on resolve slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tundra orchard and geothermal vents create a striking, evocative setting that complements the tone of loss and transition. Sensory details like steam and frost are effective, but the connection between setting and postcard feels tenuous. Atmosphere supports motivation, though inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story aims for emotional resonance but falls short, relying on stated feelings rather than showing nuanced reactions. Imagery around vents and crabs is promising but overexplained, reducing impact. The ending feels unresolved, lacking a satisfying payoff. Theme of bridging worlds is present but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of hermit crabs as a metaphor for transition is original, the execution feels forced and overly literal. Emotional handling is surface-level, with stated rancor rather than shown nuance. Writing style is functional but lacks distinct voice, and some phrases feel repetitive or generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story struggles to cohesively integrate all elements, with the postcard and crabs feeling more like add-ons than essential components. Style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate. It leaves little lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
