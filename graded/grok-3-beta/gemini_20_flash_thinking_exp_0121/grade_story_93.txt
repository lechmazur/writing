<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; Elias's crisis feels vague and his connection to sacred geometry is asserted rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while thereâ€™s a sense of beginning and middle, the resolution is absent, and pacing feels rushed with unclear cause-effect links within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are evocative with the migration pattern archive, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of desperate hope sometimes clashes with the abstract crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overused metaphors (labyrinth as life) and generic emotional descriptors; lacks fresh perspective or nuanced emotion, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and depth within the brief length.</comment>
