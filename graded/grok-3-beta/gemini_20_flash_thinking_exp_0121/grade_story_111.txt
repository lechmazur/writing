<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to heal the world through alchemy is clear, but Elias's "theoretically intuitive" trait feels underexplored in action; reactions to the ribbon lack depth in revealing personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of savoring ripples drives little forward momentum, and pacing feels contemplative but lacks a decisive resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with poetic imagery, but metaphors like ripples as fate feel somewhat generic; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but feels constrained by length rather than deliberate; lacks a lingering impact or profound depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
