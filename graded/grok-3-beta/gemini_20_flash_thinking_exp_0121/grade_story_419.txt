<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s no-nonsense empathic nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve humanity’s heart feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of mollifying feels repetitive and lacks escalation or deeper stakes, resulting in a somewhat static narrative despite logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum is evocative and complements the tone, with sensory details like dust motes and spectral hammer clangs enhancing atmosphere, though some connections between setting and action feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of lingering humanity, with decent use of symbolism in the stained glass heart, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable impact; it shows more than tells, yet feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is unique, the execution relies on familiar ghostly tropes without subversion; metaphors like “heart of humanity” are overused, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
