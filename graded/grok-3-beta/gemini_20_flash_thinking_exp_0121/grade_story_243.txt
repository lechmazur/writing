<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pixel's jumpiness and bizarre traits are mentioned but not deeply integrated into actions or voice; motivation to unmask the icon is clear but lacks nuanced depth or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with the mural and fishhook driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the resolution lacks a strong climactic moment within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Retro video game world is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere; pixelated details are evocative, though sensory immersion could be deeper beyond visual elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story has potential for emotional impact and subtext about truth and deception, but over-reliance on telling rather than showing diminishes impact; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining necromancy with a retro game world, but metaphors like "echoing footsteps of truth" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but not nuanced enough.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally leans toward repetition; brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, lacking deeper lingering impact.</comment>
