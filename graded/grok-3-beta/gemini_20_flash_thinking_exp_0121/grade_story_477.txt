<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation for freedom is clear, but his personality as a graceful swordsman feels underdeveloped and disconnected from his actions with the telescope; the transition from swordsman to tinkerer lacks depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the method of scavenging cosmic signals feels implausible and disrupts coherence; pacing is rushed at the climax with the rulers' sudden intervention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underwater city garden is vividly described with bioluminescent flora and bird songs, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting's connection to the telescope feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with Aris's yearning for freedom, but it leans on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet predictable, lacking deeper subtext or memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the underwater setting offers some originality, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of oppression and rebellion without subversion; language is occasionally ornate, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style often hinders clarity with over-elaborate phrasing; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
