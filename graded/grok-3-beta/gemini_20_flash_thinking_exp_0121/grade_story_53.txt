<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's rash protectiveness is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions; her shift to a seeker feels abrupt and lacks sufficient grounding in prior behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the discovery of postcards driving a shift in perspective, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and mystical tone are vividly rendered with sensory details like howling winds, enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elara's transformation, and symbolism of postcards as keys is intriguing, but the impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of postcards as portals to other realities offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of mystical discovery without subversion, and emotional depth feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
