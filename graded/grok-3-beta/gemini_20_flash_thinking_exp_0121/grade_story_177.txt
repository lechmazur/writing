<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore a lost art form is clear and aligns with his rebellious nature, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; reactions to the mask and organ feel more plot-driven than character-revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of manifesting obituaries driving the story, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between the organ's resonance and obituary creation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf and revolutionary timeframe create a vivid, symbolic setting that enhances the mood of tension; sensory details like musty paper and humming pipes are evocative, though some connections between setting and character motivation feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts thought about choices and revolution, with some effective symbolism in the mask and bookshelf, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of nuanced 'showing' over 'telling'; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of living obituaries offers originality, and metaphors like the labyrinth of choices are fresh, but some descriptors are generic, and emotional resonance relies too much on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the bookshelf and mask, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering idea but lacks deeper impact.</comment>
