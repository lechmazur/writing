<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the hidden promise to leave, and the fiercely apathetic attribute shapes Kael's internal conflict, but his personality lacks depth or distinct voice beyond surface-level weariness and defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of leaving driving the story forward, but the method of following meteor showers feels underdeveloped and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery and nebula create a striking atmosphere that supports the tone of isolation and defiance, though sensory details are sparse and the setting’s connection to the plain cloth bag feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of following meteor showers offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of disillusionment and escape without subversion, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but it lacks lingering depth or creative flair, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
