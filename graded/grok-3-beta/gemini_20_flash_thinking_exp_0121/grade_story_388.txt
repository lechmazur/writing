<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the road trip driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between legends and action are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mysterious forest glade at dawn is vividly rendered with sensory details like the "soft hush" and "ethereal glow," enhancing the mood and supporting Elias's quest, though the connection to botanical specimens feels slightly forced.</comment>
