<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to prove the illusion of safety is clear, but his personality as a cyber-templar feels underdeveloped, lacking depth beyond the surface conflict of technology versus nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc is incomplete, with the action of proving safety through light refraction feeling more symbolic than conclusive; pacing is rushed at the end, undermining resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sky burial site and storm create a vivid atmosphere, with strong sensory details of rain and lightning, but the setting's connection to the character's motivation feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of desperate hope through imagery and symbolism, but the central conflict lacks a satisfying resolution, and the theme of safety as a mirage feels stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of refracting lightning is original, the narrative relies on somewhat generic descriptors of storm and technology, and Kael's emotions are more stated than nuanced, lacking human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, missing deeper impact.</comment>
