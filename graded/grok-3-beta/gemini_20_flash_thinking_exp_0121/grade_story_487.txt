<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Boris's portrayal as a docile bruiser is intriguing, and his motivation to mold a myth is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond surface traits; reactions to the baton feel predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action of twisting the baton drives the plot, and the story achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory details like humid air and snapping plants, enhancing the atmosphere and supporting Boris's quest, though the drum solos feel somewhat disconnected from the setting's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Boris's transformation, with effective symbolism in the baton, but the ending feels slightly overwrought, and subtext is present yet not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a myth-making quest is original, some metaphors like "mold a myth from mud" feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the baton and greenhouse, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
