<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the pursuit and the mask's significance lacks clarity, leaving cause and effect somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop setting is evocative with sensory details like ozone and electric hum, enhancing the mellow intensity, but its connection to the tribal mask and broader atmosphere feels tenuous.</comment>
