<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The frail guard's physical weakness is evident, but his internal conflict and motivation lack depth; the shift from resignation to action feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the escape passage's introduction is convenient rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable escape tropes without subversion, and some descriptions (e.g., "bitter taste of servitude") feel generic rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but lacks a lingering impact or truly innovative style; the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
