<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to save his daughter is clear and drives his actions, but his personality as an overburdened clerk feels underdeveloped, lacking depth or distinct voice beyond the generic stress of his situation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with weaving between worlds driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at times, and some jumps between realities lack clear cause-effect logic, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The undersea greenhouse setting is vividly described with sensory details like the hum of life support systems, enhancing the dissonant calm tone and supporting Elias's motivation, though connections between setting and stamps feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elias's desperation and offers a thoughtful ending on perception as cure, with some effective symbolism, but it occasionally tells rather than shows emotion, and the central theme feels slightly forced in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of stamps as reality-weaving tools is original, the narrative relies on somewhat predictable sci-fi tropes of alternate worlds without fully subverting them, and emotional nuance is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
