<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels repetitive and overly symbolic; pacing is uneven with too much focus on singing, lacking dynamic progression within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Abandoned rocket launch site is evocative and ties to the theme of ascent, with strong sensory details like rust and emptiness; however, atmosphere occasionally feels forced with overdone transformation imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through empathy and hope, with decent use of symbolism (rocket site as soul ascent); yet, it leans heavily on telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of embroidered stanzas is creative, the narrative relies on repetitive metaphors (torpedo, arc) and lacks fresh emotional nuance; writing style feels ornate at times, bordering on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced into service rather than organic; style is clear but lacks depth for a lingering impact beyond surface sentiment.</comment>
