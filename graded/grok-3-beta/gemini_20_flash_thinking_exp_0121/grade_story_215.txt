<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reverend Thomas's rattled nature and inward sociability are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to entwine science and wonder feels clear but lacks depth in execution due to limited internal conflict or nuanced reaction to the setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with puzzles driving the narrative forward effectively, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The psychic research facility is vividly rendered with sensory details like humming machinery and waltz strains, enhancing the atmosphere, though the dance lessons feel somewhat disconnected from the core mood and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue and reflection on faith versus science, with some symbolism in the altar and postcard, but the emotional impact is muted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch; dialogue feels slightly stilted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending exorcism with parapsychology, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "coy aggression") feel repetitive and slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, though it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact; style supports clarity but doesn't elevate the narrative to exceptional heights.</comment>
