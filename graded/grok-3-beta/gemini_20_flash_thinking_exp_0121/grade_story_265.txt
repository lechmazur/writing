<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Deputy Harding's impassive nature and personally impersonal attribute are intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation for grace feels vague and lacks depth in execution, failing to fully reveal character through actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot's arc feels incomplete despite the word limit; the action of stretching drives a surreal shift, but cause-effect links are murky, and pacing feels uneven with rushed metaphysical transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lush orchard in a cathedral rafters is vividly surreal and enhances the atmosphere of uncharted echoes, but sensory details are sparse, and the oil change timeframe feels arbitrarily tacked on, disrupting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a faint sense of wonder through imagery and subtext of grace, but lacks emotional depth or a strong central conflict; the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful, missing a lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the surreal setting and concept show originality, the language occasionally veers into overwrought territory, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies over nuanced human insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative element integration, but the style leans toward opacity over clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering depth or question.</comment>
