<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marissa’s self-taught wizardry and ethereal nature are intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and her voice lacks distinctiveness; her actions, while daring, seem more plot-driven than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between chasing aurora patterns and the final transformation is not fully logical or cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The virtual reality archive is vividly described with evocative sensory details like aurora patterns and synesthetic warnings; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character motivation and plot clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marissa’s sacrifice and has strong imagery, but the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks depth within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is original with unique elements like digital ghosts, some metaphors (e.g., moths to flame) are clichéd, and emotional resonance relies more on stated outcomes than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
