<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious nature and rebellious streak are evident, and her motivation to coax life from barren ground is consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of a solitary visionary. Her actions align with her motivation, yet her distinct voice is underdeveloped within the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear within the word limit, with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution. The action of translating the comet's message drives the narrative, though the weathervane method feels slightly contrived. Pacing is managed well, but cause-effect links between comet and regeneration are more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, evocative atmosphere that complements the tone of deliberate wilderness. Sensory details like crushed leaves and spectral blossoms immerse the reader. However, the connection between setting and pressed flower album feels more symbolic than practical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of hope and prompts reflection on renewal, with strong imagery and symbolism (comet as transformation). The ending is satisfying, and a central theme of translating celestial signs into earthly hope emerges. However, emotional depth is shown more through setting than character nuance, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in interpreting the comet as a message-bearer, with fresh metaphors like "celestial fire into earthbound hope." Yet, the hermit archetype and barren-to-blooming trope feel familiar without full subversion. Language is purposeful, but some phrases border on ornate, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the weathervane and comet. The brief length suits the focused narrative, and it leaves a lingering sense of transformation. However, style occasionally prioritizes poetic flourish over clarity, and character depth remains a weak point.</comment>
