<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Minerva's telepathic ability and tragic immobility are well-integrated into her motivation to expose corruption, but her daughter's sudden recognition and identical telepathic gift feel underdeveloped and convenient, lacking depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of weatherizing truth driving the resolution effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the reunion, missing a beat to ground the emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly rendered with sensory details like clicking gears and hissing vapor, enhancing the gloomy tone and Minerva's isolation, though the setting's connection to the calligrapher's role feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through the mother-daughter reunion and themes of justice, with strong imagery like "liquid shadow" ink; yet, the ending smile and snapping hair tie verge on sentimental, slightly undermining the tragic depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue witnessing corruption is fresh, some metaphors like "ash and copper coins" feel familiar, and the daughter's abrupt telepathic awakening lacks nuanced buildup, hinting at formulaic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like calligraphy as truth-weatherizing, leaving a lingering sense of justice; however, minor emotional shortcuts and rushed character moments prevent it from reaching top-tier impact.</comment>
