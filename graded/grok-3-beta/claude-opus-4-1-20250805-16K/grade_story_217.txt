<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as an underestimated rebel is clear, and her motivation to revive the park aligns with her traits, but her inner emotional conflict lacks deeper exploration, making her voice somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between Theo’s call and Maya’s actions isn’t fully fleshed out, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like fog and silence, enhancing the ephemeral gloom, but the integration of the timeframe with the setting feels slightly incidental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response and employs effective imagery, like dust motes as spirits, but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the theme of adaptation, while present, doesn’t fully resonate with profound subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a fresh take on adaptation, some metaphors (e.g., "stagnant heart") feel predictable, and emotional descriptions occasionally lean on stating rather than showing, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering, thought-provoking impact, settling for a competent rather than exceptional execution.</comment>
