<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marisa's vendetta and precise creativity shape her actions powerfully, with sugar sculpting as a unique expression of rage and memory; however, her internal transformation from revenge to purpose feels slightly underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc from sculpting to discovery is clear and complete, with the trail of photographs driving momentum logically; pacing is mostly effective, though the final shift to action feels a tad rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market and rebellion timeframe create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like caramel wings and tear gas memory; the setting deeply supports Marisa's motivation and the story's tone of defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through symbolism of sugar sculptures and lockets, with subtext of memory versus erasure; ending is purposeful, though dialogue is absent, limiting some character depth; conflict is clear and well-shown, not told.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors like sugar phoenixes as rebellion; no clich√©d tropes or formulaic writing; nuanced emotion is shown through actions, though some descriptive passages verge on ornate, risking minor distraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with creative depth, leaving a lingering question of the hidden continent; style supports clarity, though brevity slightly limits character exploration; overall, a compelling, near-publishable piece with minor refinement needed.</comment>
