<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to embody values is clear, but the groggy brewer's personality feels underdeveloped; his flippant tone lacks depth or nuance beyond surface-level quips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed transitions to the brewing cellar; cause and effect are logical but lack compelling tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively eerie with darkness imagery, and the haunted mansion graveyard complements the tone, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story has some emotional resonance and uses metaphors like darkness as yeast, but the ending feels predictable, and subtext on gentrification lacks depth; dialogue is natural but limited.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While brewing metaphors are somewhat fresh, the story leans on haunted mansion tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone wavers at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks a lingering impact or truly creative synthesis; brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
