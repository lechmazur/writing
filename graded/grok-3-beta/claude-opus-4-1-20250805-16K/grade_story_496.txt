<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s repressed poet identity and lingering terror shape his internal conflict well, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the shift from fear to power lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ambush drives the plot effectively, and the spontaneous decision to explore fits logically, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a fully cohesive arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The overgrown city street is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like mutant ivy and moss, enhancing the atmosphere of nature’s dominance, though the tone’s naivety occasionally clashes with the darker mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (poetry as perfume, words on skin) and a memorable ending elevate impact, but emotional resonance is uneven due to telling over showing in key moments; central conflict resolves too abruptly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original imagery and thematic depth (poetry’s destructive power) stand out, but some metaphors feel slightly overwrought, and Marcus’s emotional arc lacks nuanced human texture at times, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration and leaves a lingering thought about art’s power, but stylistic flourishes occasionally hinder clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
