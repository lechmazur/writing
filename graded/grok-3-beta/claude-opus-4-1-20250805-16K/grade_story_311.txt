<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s portrayal as a tense bodyguard shapes his actions and instincts effectively, but his motivation, while clear, lacks depth in execution; the photograph reveals longing, yet his emotional arc feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the action of seeking ratification, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between overheard stories and freedom are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vivid and enhances the theme of rebirth, complemented by a tone of serene anger; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the low-gravity atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus’s longing for freedom and uses metaphors like blooming lilies effectively; yet, the ending feels predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a surprising punch within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in combining lunar citizenship with personal rebirth, but relies on familiar tropes of escaping control without subversion; metaphors are fresh at times, though emotional nuance is stated rather than shown consistently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements, used in service of the narrative, and leaves a lingering thought about freedom; however, the style occasionally leans on expository clarity over depth, making the brevity feel limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
