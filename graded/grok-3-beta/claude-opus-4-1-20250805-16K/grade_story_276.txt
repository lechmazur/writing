<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Chen’s transformation from uneasy emissary to a reflective keeper of broken things is compelling, with clear motivation tied to redemption, but her voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue and internal reflection, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a logical beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—some reflective moments drag while key events like the station lurching are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is vividly realized with sensory details like the glowing Earth and tumbling debris, enhancing the tone of accidental wisdom, though some atmospheric elements feel disconnected from character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (debris as mistakes) and a satisfying ending create impact, with a clear theme of redemption, but dialogue feels slightly forced and some emotional depth is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique setting and perspective, some metaphors (e.g., prayer wheel) feel overused, and emotional resonance lacks nuance, relying on stated insights rather than subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about failure and redemption, but uneven style and occasional over-explanation hinder its readiness for top-tier publication.</comment>
