<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Vega’s irate nature and smuggler background are clear, but her emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level; grief and anger drive her, yet her inner conflict lacks nuanced exploration beyond the obvious.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed toward the end; the connection between tea patterns and data streams is logical but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered and enhances the mood of isolation and loss; sensory details are sparse but effective when present, though the atmosphere could be deepened with more tactile elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Vega’s grief and realization, and the chopstick as a symbol works well; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, the betrayed partner trope isn’t subverted; metaphors like the chopstick are fresh, but emotional handling occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like tea patterns, but it doesn’t fully transcend its constraints; it leaves a lingering feeling, yet lacks the depth for a truly unforgettable impact.</comment>
