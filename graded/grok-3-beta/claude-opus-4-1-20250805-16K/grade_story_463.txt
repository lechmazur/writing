<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct with clear motivations—sentinel's dry wit and determination to learn traditional methods shine, and the ghost's tragic past is poignant. However, deeper emotional layers or internal conflict for the sentinel could elevate authenticity beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a satisfying resolution within the word limit, driven by the dance and learning process. Pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat to deepen the emotional handover of knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse bedroom is vividly rendered with sensory details like "wind through broken glass" and "moldering bed," enhancing mood and character motivation. Minor inconsistency in tone with overly poetic flourishes slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (rope as burden, dance as connection) evoke emotion and subtext about duty and loss. Dialogue feels natural, but the central theme of promises could be woven more subtly to avoid explicitness; ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing shows style and ingenuity through the dance as a knowledge conduit, avoiding most clichés. Some metaphors like "sea foam" feel slightly generic, and emotional depth relies occasionally on stated feelings rather than pure showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly serving the narrative, not vice versa. Creative integration of dance and lighthouse lore adds depth, but minor over-reliance on ornate language slightly hinders clarity. Lingering impact is present but not striking enough for top-tier status.</comment>
