<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is moderately effective; the herbalistâ€™s exhaustion and indifference are clear, but her motivation feels slightly inconsistent, lacking deeper insight into why she persists despite disillusionment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but lacks a strong arc; the story meanders without a decisive resolution, and pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with too much focus on internal reflection over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The glass-walled observatory and ocean cliff setting are vividly rendered and enhance the mood of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with poignant imagery (e.g., useless data as pressed flowers), but emotional resonance is undercut by a lack of clear conflict or a satisfying ending; subtext is present but not fully developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality is evident in the unique premise and tone of fervent indifference, but some metaphors feel forced, and emotional handling occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creativity in combining elements, but cohesion suffers from a lack of narrative drive; the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, and the lingering impact is muted.</comment>
