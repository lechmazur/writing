<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kestra’s cyber-templar identity and motivation to confront reality are intriguing but underdeveloped; her "patiently frantic" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance or backstory to anchor her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of proving lightning’s vulnerability driving the narrative, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between digital and physical realms is conceptually muddled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sky burial site setting is vividly evoked with sensory details like circling vultures and storm imagery, enhancing the tone of euphoric agitation, though the integration of cyber elements feels jarring against the spiritual atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes awe through its imagery and concept of breaking physics, with strong symbolism in the bridle and prism, but the emotional resonance is undercut by a lack of deeper subtext and an ending that feels more visually striking than thematically satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an inventive blend of cyberpunk and spirituality, it occasionally leans on overused metaphors like "safety as illusion" without fresh subversion, and Kestra’s emotions are more stated than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive in its ambition to merge assigned elements, with creative interplay between digital and physical, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
