<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of outwitting driving tension, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the consciousness transfer concept is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk engine room setting enhances the atmosphere with vivid sensory details like humming steam and brass pistons, effectively supporting the tone, though the wedding aftermath timeframe feels underutilized.</comment>
