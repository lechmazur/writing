<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's portrayal as a solitary birdwatcher shapes her unique perspective, but her motivation feels partially obscured by poetic abstraction, lacking consistent grounding in concrete actions or dialogue that reveal her inner conflict more directly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven; the transformation of data into poetry, while creative, lacks sufficient buildup to feel fully coherent or impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The leaf classification office setting is vividly described with sensory detail like polished marble floors, enhancing the ghostly atmosphere, but the connection between setting and cosmic timeframe feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its subtext of nonviolent resistance and employs striking imagery like the shattered mask, but the ending feels more symbolic than emotionally satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharper resolution within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on nonviolence and chaos, some metaphors (e.g., "peaceful wildfire") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the mask and cosmic blink, but the style occasionally veers into over-complexity, obscuring clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as sharply as it could with tighter focus.</comment>
