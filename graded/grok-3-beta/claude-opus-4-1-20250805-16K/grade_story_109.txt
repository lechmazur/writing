<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Knight Severin's cold-natured trait is clear, but his shift to emotional warmth feels abrupt and underdeveloped given the word limit; motivation is present but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with the altar transformation, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between folk remedies and artistic awakening is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret agent center setting is intriguing and ties to the altars, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional stakes of the awakening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance with the mitten and altar, but relies too much on telling over showing; dialogue feels purposeful but stiff, and the theme of wisdom over protocol is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of blending folk remedies with agency work is fresh, the execution leans on predictable emotional triggers (lost mitten, grandmother's memory) without nuanced subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style lacks polish, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not profound depth.</comment>
