<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation to reverse photosynthesis as a metaphor for resurrecting loss is intriguing, but her personality feels underdeveloped; her actions are driven by plot necessity rather than a deeply explored internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the enzyme release driving a climactic moment, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between wedding toasts and her mission is tenuous, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The photosynthesis lab as a wedding venue is vividly realized with strong sensory details like bioluminescent orchids and grow lights, enhancing atmosphere; however, the tone occasionally clashes with the primal sophistication intended.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about loss and transformation, with potent symbolism in the glowing plants, but the ending feels more dramatic than satisfying, and dialogue lacks natural flow, diminishing emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of reversible photosynthesis is original, and metaphors like “impossible sunrise” are fresh, but emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative leans on predictable scientist-as-visionary tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the hair clip and lab setting, leaving a lingering question about science versus nature, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
