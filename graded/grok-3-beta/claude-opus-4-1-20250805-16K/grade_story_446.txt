<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Marcus's transformation, but the amiable gambler trait feels surface-level and inconsistently tied to his deeper motives; his obsession lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc and logical progression within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed resolution; the concept of unbecoming drives the story but isn't fully integrated into action causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of firefly breeding grounds is evocative and ties well to the tone of peaceful anger; sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through Marcus's journey, with some effective symbolism (ledger, fireflies), but lacks deeper subtext; ending is satisfying yet predictable, missing a sharper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar redemption tropes without subversion; metaphors like petals falling are somewhat generic, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced; style supports clarity but lacks distinctive flair; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not profound depth.</comment>
