<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Senna's reserved nature and oracle-like insight shape her quiet determination, but her motivation to preserve art feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper personal stakes or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to restoration is clear and well-paced within constraints, with the Resonance Stitch driving a logical progression; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, lacking a sharper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly realized with sensory details like humming threads and choir harmonies, enhancing the atmosphere of resurrection; minor disconnect between setting and everyday board meeting reference slightly jars immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through imagery of captured melodies and subtle subtext of preservation, with a satisfying ending; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and emotional depth could be shown more through Senna’s reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of stitching sound is original, some metaphors (e.g., “ghosts seeking form”) feel familiar, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; style is distinct but not wholly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story coheres well with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of wonder about preservation; however, the brief length slightly limits depth of character and conflict, feeling more like a sketch than a fully realized piece.</comment>
