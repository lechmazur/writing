<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's vigilance and punctuality shape his investigative drive, but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; grief and sardonic glee are stated more than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause-effect links are logical, though the peacock pattern connection strains believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility setting is unique but underutilized for sensory immersion; atmosphere supports the tone of conspiracy, yet lacks vivid details to ground the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marcus's loss, and the paper airplane dove offers symbolism, but dialogue feels stilted and expository; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the conspiracy trope feels predictable without subversion; metaphors like "crumpled like badly folded origami" are fresh but sparse, and emotional resonance leans on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative; style is clear but lacks polish, and the length feels constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
