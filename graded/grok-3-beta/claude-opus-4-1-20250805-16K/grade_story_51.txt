<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation for redemption is clear, and his use of the crate slat as a talisman reveals guilt, but his voice lacks distinctiveness, and the transformation feels slightly surface-level given the depth expected.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between staging meetings and the final transformation isn’t fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is vividly described with sensory details (crackling, sparks) that enhance atmosphere and support the theme of tension and release, though its connection to Marcus’s motivation feels somewhat incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on resilience and redemption, with effective symbolism in the crate slat, but dialogue occasionally feels didactic, and the central conflict lacks deeper tension or stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of transformation is handled with some nuance, metaphors like “static electricity danced like applause” feel slightly generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated remorse than shown complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the static garden, but the style occasionally leans toward overt explanation over subtle depth, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
