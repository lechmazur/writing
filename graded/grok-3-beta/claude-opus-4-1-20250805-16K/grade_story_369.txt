<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's portrayal as a fanatical puzzle maker is intriguing, and his optimistically bitter attribute shapes his reactions, but his deeper motivations and emotional layers remain somewhat opaque, limiting full character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by mysterious packages, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolutions and some unclear cause-effect links between events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting on a rocky island is vividly rendered with sensory details and complements the tone of lethargic excitement, enhancing the mood of isolation, though some connections to character motivation feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., puzzles as grief), with a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext in places and occasionally tells rather than shows emotion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of puzzles as grief is unique, some metaphors feel generic, and emotional handling occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings; overall style is distinct but not wholly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length suits the melancholic tone, but uneven emotional depth and clarity issues prevent a lingering impact or exceptional distinction.</comment>
