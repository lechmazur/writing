<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of transformation driving the resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and Rainbow Canyon create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the tone of nostalgic defiance, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective emotional response with strong imagery like the ghost orchid blooming, but the dialogue feels stilted at times, and the theme of redemption lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
