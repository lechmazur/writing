<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows promise with the exiled prince's loneliness and introspection, but motivation feels underdeveloped; his actions lack deeper exploration of exile's impact beyond surface-level isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence within the word limit with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between storm and unseen forces is underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with vivid sensory details of snow and decay enhancing the mood; the abandoned customs office is well-integrated, though the timeframe's symbolic weight feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes emotion through shared loneliness, with strong imagery and subtext, but dialogue is somewhat stilted, and the central theme of connection feels slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by familiar tropes of exiled royalty and chance encounters; metaphors like "blind eyes" are overused, though emotional nuance in shared moments offers some freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is decent with elements serving the story, but style occasionally leans toward overwrought description; the brief length feels deliberate but lacks a truly lingering impact.</comment>
