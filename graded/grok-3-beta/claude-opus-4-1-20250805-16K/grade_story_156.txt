<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ambassador Chen's confusion and diplomatic role are clear, but her internal transformation lacks depth due to limited exploration of personal stakes or backstory; her motivation feels somewhat surface-level despite alignment with the story's theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of liberalization driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, but the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The subterranean salt mine village is vividly realized with evocative sensory details of crystalline walls and bioluminescent gardens, strongly supporting the atmosphere and tone; the setting enhances the action, though the timeframe of bus rides feels underutilized for deeper impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its theme of collective intelligence and adaptation, with effective symbolism in the starlings and key; however, the emotional response is muted by a lack of deeper character connection, and the ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending evolutionary wisdom with diplomacy, and metaphors like the "counterpoint of hearts" are fresh; yet, some sensory details feel generic, and emotional handling occasionally leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about adaptation and patterns; however, the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
