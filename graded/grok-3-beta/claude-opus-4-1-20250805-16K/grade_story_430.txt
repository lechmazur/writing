<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The closed-off reaver's personality is well-defined through his isolation and inherited traits, with clear motivation to break generational patterns; however, his internal shift feels slightly abrupt without deeper exploration of his past actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from reflection to resolution is clear within the word limit, driven by the reaver's introspection, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat of emotional buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope Park is vividly realized with fractured mirrors enhancing the theme of broken reflections; sensory details are strong, though some atmospheric elements could tie more directly to the character's emotional state.</comment>
