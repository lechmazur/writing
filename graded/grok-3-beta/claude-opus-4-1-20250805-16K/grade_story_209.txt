<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to map railways is clear, but his emotional depth and voice feel underdeveloped; reactions to revelations lack nuanced internal conflict for a seasoned woodsman.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed; the short-circuit action drives tension, though some causal links between deception and railways are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radio wave garden setting is vividly realized with sensory detail like harmonics and aurora patterns; atmosphere supports the tone, though integration with hospital timeframe feels slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (hairbrush as modulator) are striking, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; ending is purposeful yet lacks deeper resonance or subtext beyond surface truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of hidden railways and radio wave gardens is original, with fresh metaphors; however, emotional handling leans on stated feelings, and some descriptive passages border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
