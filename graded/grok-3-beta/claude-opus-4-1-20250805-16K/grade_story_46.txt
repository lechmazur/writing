<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn the language of dreams is intriguing but underdeveloped; the blank-faced attribute feels more stylistic than revealing of personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed; connections between moon paths and rumor approval are conceptually interesting yet lack clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting of the orchard with giant ferns and waterfalls is vividly realized with strong sensory detail, enhancing the ethereal atmosphere and complementing the precise madness tone.</comment>
