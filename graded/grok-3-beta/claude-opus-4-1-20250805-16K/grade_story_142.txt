<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Magdalena's motivation to uncover her family’s legacy is clear and tied to her status as a broke aristocrat, but her inner conflict and personality lack depth beyond the central obsession; her voice, while distinct in resolve, feels somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the ghostly roller coaster ride as a method of revelation is intriguing yet not fully cohesive with the story’s logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting and the blurry vividness of parallel realities create a striking atmosphere that enhances the theme of legacy; sensory details like the groaning wooden skeleton are evocative, though some elements feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on legacy and obsession with strong symbolism (the blank page, ghostly ride), and the ending is purposeful; however, emotional depth is somewhat told rather than shown, and the central conflict resolves too neatly for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative offers a unique take on legacy through the amusement park metaphor, avoiding overt clichés, but some imagery (e.g., reality blurring) feels slightly generic; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced subtext in character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like legacy and the roller coaster, leaving a lingering thought about inherited burdens; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
