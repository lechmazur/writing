<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Keras's spinelessness is well-integrated as a defining trait, shaping his actions and motivations, but his internal transformation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the prophecy and Keras's actions could be more logically fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The map projection room is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery, though the timeframe "hush after the wind no longer howls" feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key, maps) and a satisfying ending with subtext about inner horizons, but emotional resonance is somewhat muted by telling rather than showing Keras's fear at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a spineless hero is fresh, some metaphors (light fracturing through prisms) feel slightly overused, and emotional depth lacks the rawness needed for true originality in a competitive market.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, limiting depth; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
