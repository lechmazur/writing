<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marlena's duality as a faux fortune teller with real visions shapes her internal conflict well, but her motivations lack deeper nuance beyond the pursuit of the vision; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arcs effectively from vision to discovery within the word limit, with clear cause and effect, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution of her inner struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Archive of Extinct Languages setting enhances the mystical tone and ties beautifully to the bone flute, with evocative rain-slicked cobblestone imagery; sensory details are strong but could be more varied beyond sight and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and reflection on language as prophecy, with strong symbolism in the flute; the ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels slightly forced, and subtext about fraud versus truth could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in linking language to planting and prophecy, avoiding clich√©s, though some descriptors (e.g., "unbearable truth") feel generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of visions and language; it leaves a lingering thought on hidden truths, though stylistic clarity is occasionally muddled by dense phrasing.</comment>
