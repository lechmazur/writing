<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and ties the beginning to a satisfying end within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at key revelations, sacrificing depth for progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The futuristic hub and hidden sunrise blend evocatively with the cursed orchard, enhancing the atmosphere with vivid sensory details like whispering pears; minor inconsistency in tone-tech integration slightly distracts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact through gleeful sorrow and powerful symbolism (dragon tooth, cursed fruit), with a satisfying ending; however, some exposition-heavy moments 'tell' rather than 'show' emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original in blending futuristic and mythical elements, with fresh metaphors, but relies on familiar 'cursed inheritance' tropes without fully subverting them; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated too directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with creative depth, leaving a lingering sense of magic's return; style supports the narrative, though brevity sometimes limits fuller exploration of themes.</comment>
