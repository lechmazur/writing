<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's character is intriguing, with insomnia sharpening her senses and driving her obsessive arrangement of botanical samples, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped—her shift to non-violence is clear but lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from obsession with death to embracing peace is coherent within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, pacing feels slightly rushed in the transition to understanding non-violence, missing some intermediate steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted attic setting is vividly realized with sensory details like whispers and creaking floorboards, enhancing the eerie, contemplative atmosphere; it strongly supports the character's journey, though the subway timeframe integration feels more peripheral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on power and restraint through potent metaphors of deadly plants as impotent beauty, with a satisfying ending; yet, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme, while clear, could be woven with more subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative offers a fresh take on non-violence through botanical symbolism, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., "empty abundance") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements like the haunted attic and botanical samples, leaving a lingering thought on restraint; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity over depth.</comment>
