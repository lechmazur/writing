<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kira's introverted nature and empathic abilities are portrayed with some depth, influencing her connection to the asteroid's consciousness, but her motivations feel underdeveloped and her voice lacks distinctiveness in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, driven by reassembling the marionette, but pacing feels uneven with rushed exposition and the concept of mountain wisdom isn't fully integrated into the plot's momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout setting is evocative and enhances the story's mood of isolation, with sensory details like the pull of gravity, but the connection between the setting and the dried starfish feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder and prompts reflection on patience and cosmic connection through effective symbolism, but the dialogue feels stilted and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger emotional punch within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise with the living asteroid, some metaphors (e.g., stars as bioluminescent plankton) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally veers into overwrought prose, diminishing clarity and overall impact.</comment>
