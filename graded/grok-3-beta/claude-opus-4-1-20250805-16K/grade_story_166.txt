<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Martha's ghostly caretaker role shapes her actions and motivation to bridge human-animal communication, but her personality feels underdeveloped beyond the assigned "solemnly silly" trait, lacking a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with perforating reality driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—key revelations are rushed, and the connection between the wish and transformation lacks clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen orchard with geothermal streams is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and supporting the magical tone, though the setting's connection to the plastic straw feels tenuous.</comment>
