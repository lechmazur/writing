<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mirin's meekness as a necromancer is intriguing and shapes her gentle approach to spirits, but her motivation, while clear, lacks depth in execution—her transformation feels slightly abrupt given the short length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, yet the universal riddle's impact on the plot is more conceptual than dynamic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like phosphorescent moss and dripping water, enhancing the mystic tone; however, the playground sounds above feel slightly underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through the dewdrop metaphor and tangled tapestry imagery, with a satisfying ending; yet, the central conflict of solving the riddle feels more intellectual than visceral, limiting emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the broken pen and dewdrop, leaving a lingering thought on life's brevity; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
