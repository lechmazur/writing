<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sister Margot's transformation from doubt to conduit is intriguing, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word count; her internal shift lacks granular emotional detail to fully anchor her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from skepticism to revelation is clear but feels rushed at key emotional turns; the decoding of echoes as a method is imaginative yet not fully logical within the story’s framework, leaving some cause-effect gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glass desert is vividly rendered with sensory details like crystallized sand and copper sky, enhancing the mystical tone; however, the connection between setting and object (fork) feels tenuous, slightly diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (butterfly as faith, piano as revelation) evoke thought, and the theme of faith as raw magic is compelling; yet, the ending feels more poetic than resolute, lacking a fully satisfying conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh take on faith and magic with unique metaphors (fork as conductor, glass desert echoes), avoiding overt clichés; however, some sensory details are generic, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; yet, the style sometimes prioritizes poetic flourish over clarity, and the lingering impact is strong but not unforgettable.</comment>
