<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Marcus's impassive nature is stated but not fully explored through nuanced actions or internal conflict, and his motivation feels somewhat surface-level despite the personal connection to bees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the twist ties and bee language, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution of Maria's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard setting is vividly realized with striking sensory details and atmosphere, enhancing the mystical tone and echoing the concept of uncharted echoes, though the timeframe of oil changes feels slightly disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a sense of wonder with strong imagery and subtext about connection and grace, but the emotional impact is somewhat diluted by a lack of deeper character exploration; dialogue feels purposeful yet sparse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining beesâ€™ language and a surreal orchard, with fresh metaphors, though some emotional beats are stated rather than shown, and the concept of uncharted echoes feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration and a lingering sense of mystery, but it falls short of top-tier publishability due to uneven character depth and rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
