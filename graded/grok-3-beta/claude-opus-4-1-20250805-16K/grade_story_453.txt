<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Hollis’s relentless pursuit of meaning, but his foolhardiness feels underexplored; it lacks a defining moment of recklessness to solidify this trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a subtle shift in understanding, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between seasonal changes and the giant’s presence isn’t fully developed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The snow globe setting is vividly realized with strong sensory details like vibrations and shifting constellations; atmosphere supports the detached tone well, though smell and taste are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity with its metaphysical undertones and effective imagery (e.g., snowflakes as messages); however, the central conflict with the Council feels underdeveloped, lacking tension in resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the snow globe concept and philosophical subtext, with fresh metaphors; yet, some descriptors (e.g., “eternal winter”) feel slightly generic, and emotional nuance could be deeper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about existence; brevity feels deliberate but slightly limits depth, and style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
