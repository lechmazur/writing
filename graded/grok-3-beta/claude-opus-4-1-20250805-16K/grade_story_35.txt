<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as a quiet gardener with an emotional connection to plants is intriguing, but her motivation feels underdeveloped and her reactions to the purse lack depth; her voice is distinct but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with recovered memories driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Universal Translation Center and bird calls create a vivid setting, with sensory details like bird songs enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and specific actions could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maya's longing and uses symbolism effectively with the purse, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about connection, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
