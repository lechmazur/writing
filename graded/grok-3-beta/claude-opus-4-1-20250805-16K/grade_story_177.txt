<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The giant’s bookshelf setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like dust motes and echoes, enhancing the atmosphere of rebellion, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about destiny and transformation with striking imagery, like the organ’s silent music, but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and emotional resonance relies more on concept than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining rebellion with music and destiny, avoiding clichés, though some metaphors, like “moths fleeing flame,” are less fresh, and emotional nuance could be deeper rather than stated via the mask’s shifts.</comment>
