<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Brother Cornelius's zealotry and inner conflict are vividly portrayed, with vulnerability emerging through his confession, but his motivations waver between divine certainty and doubt without fully crystallizing into a coherent arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven as the bottle cap's significance overshadows broader narrative progression, leaving some cause-effect links tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Victorian parlor in the jungle is strikingly realized with evocative sensory details (humidity, vines, monkey shrieks) that enhance the atmosphere of absurdity and mystery, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly underplayed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on control and mystery through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue feels slightly stilted and the central conflict of faith versus surrender lacks sharper resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of mystery, but stylistic flourishes sometimes obscure clarity, and the brief length occasionally limits deeper exploration of themes.</comment>
