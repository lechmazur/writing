<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Vera Collective’s hive-mind attribute shapes her unique ability and voice, with harmonizing voices reflecting her nature, but Agent Morrison’s motivation and emotional depth feel underdeveloped, relying on stated regret rather than nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of draining regret driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between wax shapes and emotional release are not fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The secret agent facility setting complements the tone and action, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere; the night timeframe enhances tension but isn’t vividly evoked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Morrison’s regret and Vera’s transformation of pain, with effective symbolism in wax shapes, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and subtext is present yet not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of "sound of hindsight" is original and well-integrated, avoiding clichés, with fresh metaphors like "bitter honey"; however, some emotional descriptions lean toward stating rather than showing, missing deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the hive-mind and hindsight, leaving a lingering thought about transforming pain, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels slightly limiting to depth.</comment>
