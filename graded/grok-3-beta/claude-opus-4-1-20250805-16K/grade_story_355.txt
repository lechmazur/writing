<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's aloofness as a dancer is well-portrayed through her detachment from past crowds and personal connections, but her internal conflict lacks deeper exploration to fully flesh out her motivations beyond surface regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, with a discernible arc through Maya’s dance and realization, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between her actions and emotional resolution are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The psychedelic art installation is vividly realized with sensory detail, enhancing the mood of forgotten revelry and Maya’s isolation, though the timeframe’s specificity (“after the last balloon deflates”) feels underutilized in grounding the atmosphere further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maya’s unspoken letters and symbolic dance, with strong imagery like the compass and confetti, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch to maximize impact; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of dancing letters home is original, some metaphors (e.g., “abandoned stars”) feel slightly generic, and emotional resonance, though nuanced, occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than fully showing them through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the compass and installation, leaving a lingering sense of introspection, but stylistic choices sometimes border on ornate, slightly hindering clarity and raw emotional depth.</comment>
