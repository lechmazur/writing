<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Markov's longevity and bitterness are well-defined, shaping his motivation to restore the garden, but his inner emotional evolution lacks depth beyond surface-level reactions; his voice, while distinct, feels somewhat one-note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to restoration is clear and cohesive within the word limit, with logical cause and effect, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The particle acceleration garden is vividly imagined, enhancing the action and concept, with strong sensory details like crystalline groves and living light butterflies; however, some atmospheric elements feel detached from Markov's personal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its themes of erased history and resilience, with effective symbolism in the cracking murals, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by limited character depth; the ending is satisfying yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its quantum garden concept and restoration metaphor, avoiding clich√©s, but some descriptions (e.g., "bitter laughter") feel repetitive, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about history's persistence, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; the short length feels deliberate yet limits emotional depth.</comment>
