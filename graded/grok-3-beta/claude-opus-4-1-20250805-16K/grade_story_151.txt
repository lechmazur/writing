<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The astronomer’s motivation is clear, driven by lingering emotion and a desire to restore humanity, which aligns with her actions. However, her personality lacks depth beyond the central conflict, and her voice isn’t distinctly unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the cultivation action driving the narrative forward. However, pacing feels uneven, with rushed resolution, and some cause-effect links are more poetic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting of the lighthouse orchard above ice floes is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the crystalline, cold atmosphere. The tone complements the concept of lost emotion, though the connection between setting and object feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes thought and emotion through strong imagery and a poignant ending. Symbolism of the veil and orchard is effective, but subtext is occasionally heavy-handed, and the central conflict’s resolution feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its premise and imagery, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “crystalline prison”) feel overused. Emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about humanity’s return. However, the style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
