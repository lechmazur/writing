<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s irate nature is clear and drives his initial conflict, but his emotional shift feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal struggle. Motivation is consistent, though his voice could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a logical progression from anger to reconciliation. Pacing is mostly effective, though the resolution feels slightly rushed, missing deeper exploration of the emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The witch’s spellbook study is vividly rendered with a static atmosphere that enhances the timeless theme. Sensory details are strong, though the childhood bedroom flashback feels underutilized in sensory depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus’s reconciliation, with effective symbolism in the pendant. The ending is satisfying, but dialogue occasionally feels expository. Subtext is present, though not fully layered.</comment>
