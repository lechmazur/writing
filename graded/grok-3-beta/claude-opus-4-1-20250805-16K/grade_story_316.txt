<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thalia's timid nature and seraphic skill are well-defined, but her transformation to leadership feels slightly abrupt given the depth of her shyness; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced development within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the scoreboard clue device strains coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the reimagined temple is evocative and ties well to the collective healing concept; sensory details like the factory whistle and loom sounds enhance atmosphere, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the tapestry of shared trauma, and the ending is satisfying; imagery and symbolism (ribbon as memory) are strong, but dialogue is minimal and lacks distinctiveness; theme of healing is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in weaving typewriter ribbons into fabric as a healing metaphor, but some phrases (e.g., "gentlest revolution") feel slightly clich√©d; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally veers into overwriting; length feels deliberate, and the lingering idea of collective mending adds depth, though not exceptionally memorable.</comment>
