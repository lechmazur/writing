<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's gentle nature as a conjurer is somewhat evident in her magical finesse, but her motivation for justice feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit; her distinct voice is present in her laughter, though it lacks deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot is well-structured with a clear arc from discovery to resolution, driven by the act of reassembling the butterfly; pacing is managed effectively, though the sudden revelation of Thorgrim's guilt feels a bit rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground dwarven city is vividly realized and enhances the action of reassembling the butterfly; sensory details like color eruptions are evocative, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overdone for the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the resurrection of the garden and justice served, with strong imagery and symbolism in the butterfly; the ending is satisfying, though dialogue is minimal and subtext could be deeper.</comment>
