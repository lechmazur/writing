<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's portrayal as a bluffing swindler is clear, but his shift from con to confession feels abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict or nuance in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations; cause and effect are logical, though the ghosts' role in the narrative feels forced at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is vividly realized with strong atmospheric potential, enhancing the mood of loss and renewal, though sensory details are sparse beyond the visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the theme of buried truth, but the dialogue feels slightly stiff, and the conflict resolution is too neat for the story's depth; subtext is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers an original setting and concept, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "invisible allies") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so, due to underdeveloped character depth.</comment>
