<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's overconfidence and artificially authentic trait are intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution, feeling more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of broadcasting data driving a satisfying resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed and some cause-effect links are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The magnetic field observatory setting enhances the mysterious tone and supports the concept of parallel realities well, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about multiverse truths and has a satisfying ending, with some effective symbolism (spinning top), but subtext feels surface-level and emotional showing is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the parallel realities concept offers originality, the narrative leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion; metaphors are fresh at times but emotional nuance is lacking, feeling somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering idea of infinite possibilities, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
