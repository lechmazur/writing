<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to decode the blank card and inherit the school is clear, but her "restless" nature as a conjurer feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions or voice beyond a late arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a satisfying connection between beginning and end within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, but the executor’s haggle lacks impact on the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cave pearl diving school setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like bioluminescent algae and liquid glass reflections, enhancing the tone of layered tranquility and supporting Mei's motivation, though the timeframe’s specificity feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through the metaphor of diving and conjuring as parallel arts, with a clear theme of belief in the unseen; the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying more on stated insights than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending illusion and pearl diving, with fresh metaphors like breath as currency, but some descriptions (e.g., "crystallized in her mind") verge on cliché, and emotional depth lacks subtle human nuance at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the blank card and diving school, leaving a lingering thought about transformation, but the style occasionally prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
