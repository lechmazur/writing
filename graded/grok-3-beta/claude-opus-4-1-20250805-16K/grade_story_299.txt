<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina’s uncertainty as a champion is well-rendered, but her motivations occasionally feel broad rather than deeply personal; her voice lacks distinctiveness in key moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven, with rushed resolutions and underdeveloped conflict progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., "trapped sunshine") feel familiar; emotional nuance is present but inconsistently executed, lacking a truly unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with some creativity, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it lingers mildly but lacks profound depth.</comment>
