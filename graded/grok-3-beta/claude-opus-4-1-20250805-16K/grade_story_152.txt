<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to salvage knowledge is clear and drives actions, but the "frenzied juggler" lacks depth in personality beyond the symbolic role, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times within the word limit, and some cause-effect links (like the letter's origin) are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The yawning void and abandoned summer create a haunting atmosphere that supports the theme of loss, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (juggling as bridging cultures) and subtext about preserving knowledge evokes thought, but emotional resonance is undercut by an overly abstract style.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original in concept with fresh metaphors, but some imagery feels ornate and risks purple prose; emotional nuance is present but not fully grounded in specific character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but the abstract style slightly hinders clarity and the short length feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
