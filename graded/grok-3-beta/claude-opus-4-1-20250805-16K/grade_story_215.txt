<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Father Marcus's rattled state and inwardly social nature are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to merge faith and science feels stated rather than deeply explored through action or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc from mystery to revelation, driven by puzzles and guarded disclosures, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, missing deeper cause-effect grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The psychic research facility and dance lessons create a unique, evocative atmosphere, complemented by sensory details like waltz music; the setting enhances the concept, though some connections to character motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts thought on faith versus science, with effective symbolism in the dance and puzzles, but emotional resonance is limited by 'telling' over 'showing'; dialogue feels purposeful yet not fully natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise is original, blending exorcism with science, some metaphors (e.g., dance as balance) feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but often explicitly stated rather than shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like dance lessons and puzzles, leaving a lingering idea of synthesized belief, though the brief length feels somewhat restrictive, limiting deeper exploration.</comment>
