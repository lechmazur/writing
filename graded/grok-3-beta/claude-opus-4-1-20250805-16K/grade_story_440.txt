<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kenzo’s detachment and warrior past shape his restrained actions and motivation to find Mei, but his inner emotional depth feels underexplored; the voice lacks distinctiveness beyond stoic resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is driven effectively by reassembling the collage as a map to a moment, with a clear arc within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax with minimal buildup to the reality tear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center enhances the tone of playful seriousness and supports Kenzo’s mission; vivid details like whirring machines and chrome underbelly immerse, though sensory variety (smell, touch) is limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes longing and determination through imagery and subtext like the sea pottery’s pulse; the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is slightly undercut by overt statements of intent over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like weaving reality are fresh, the narrative leans on familiar warrior-on-a-mission tropes without full subversion; emotional handling shows some nuance but occasionally states feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story coheres well with creative integration of elements like the Weavers and pottery; it leaves a lingering question of fate vs. control, though the style sometimes prioritizes ornate imagery over clarity.</comment>
