<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kira’s hesitation as a saboteur shapes her internal conflict effectively, and her motivation to judge the chamber’s fate aligns with her rare ability to notice subtle signs, but her emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped, missing a stronger personal voice or nuanced reaction to her daughter’s mention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from judgment to preservation is clear within the word limit, with footsteps as a method driving the narrative logically; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the shift in Council’s intent lacks foreshadowing, creating a minor coherence gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The harmonic resonance chamber is vividly realized with evocative sound imagery, enhancing the tone of savage serenity and Kira’s motivation, though sensory details beyond sound (like touch or smell) are sparse, limiting full immersion in the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on preservation versus destruction, with strong imagery (compass spinning in chaos) and a satisfying ending; however, the central conflict’s resolution feels slightly abrupt, and the theme of home could be explored with deeper subtext.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of sonic mapping via footsteps is original, some metaphors (walls singing) feel familiar, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but occasionally overwrought with elaborate phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the chamber and compass, and the brevity feels deliberate, but stylistic flourishes sometimes hinder clarity; it leaves a lingering question about home, though emotional impact could be sharper.</comment>
