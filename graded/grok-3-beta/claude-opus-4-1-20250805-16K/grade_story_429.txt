<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Marta’s drive to unlock ancestral voices, but her personality as an earthy farmer feels underdeveloped beyond physical descriptions; her distinct voice is not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a beginning, middle, and emotional resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the voices’ emergence, and the concept of encoded recordings stretches logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The northern lights setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the hushed euphoria and ritualistic atmosphere; it strongly supports the story’s mood and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the ancestral voices and has striking imagery, like the aurora’s glow, but the central conflict feels slightly contrived, and subtext is present yet not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of sound in dough is original, but some metaphors (e.g., “star-drunk sky”) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown but occasionally stated, lacking subtle nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the scale and northern lights, leaving a lingering emotional impact, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
