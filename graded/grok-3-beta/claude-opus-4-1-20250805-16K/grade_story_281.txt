<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the dummy encounter driving transformation, but pacing feels unevenâ€”introspection overshadows action, and the resolution is somewhat rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with rust and steam, enhancing the eerie atmosphere and complementing the transformation concept, though sensory details could be more varied beyond sight and sound.</comment>
