<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's role as a social media exorcist shapes his actions, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and shifts without clear grounding; his reactions to receipts lack depth, and his voice, while distinct, doesn’t fully resonate with emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical beginning and end, but pacing feels uneven—some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily; the concept of familiar strangers drives the narrative, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and alleyway settings enhance the mood of digital resurrection, complemented by evocative sensory details like “wet concrete”; however, the timeframe’s integration feels incidental, and the atmosphere only partially supports character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its subtext of analog revival, with strong imagery like “digital ghosts”; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying, and while dialogue is natural, the central conflict feels understated for the story’s ambitious themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining digital erasure with physical receipts, avoiding clichés through fresh metaphors; however, some sensory details are generic, and emotional resonance occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brevity seems deliberate, but style sometimes obscures clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought about digital identity, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
