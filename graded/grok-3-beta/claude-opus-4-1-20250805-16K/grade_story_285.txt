<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hesitant swordsman’s awkwardness and motivation to restore tradition are present, but his inner transformation feels abrupt and lacks depth. His voice is indistinct, and reactions to the postcard are more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of emerging driving the narrative. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between betrayal and resolution are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the tone of ephemeral rancor. The atmosphere supports the concept of bridging worlds, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its themes of restoration and betrayal, with decent use of symbolism (postcard, hermit crabs). However, the ending lacks a strong punch, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids blatant clichés, the metaphors (hermit crabs, steam) are somewhat overused and not entirely fresh. Emotional nuance is limited, and the style, though competent, lacks a unique stamp. No overt AI-like flaws, but originality is middling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the lingering impact is moderate, lacking profound depth.</comment>
