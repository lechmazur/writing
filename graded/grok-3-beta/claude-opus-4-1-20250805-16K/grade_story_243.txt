<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Morthis's jumpiness and bizarre necromantic tendencies are portrayed with some clarity, but his motivations lack depth beyond unmasking Elektra; reactions to the fishhook feel functional rather than revealing of inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution within the word limit, driven by the action of faltering and the mural analysis; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly realized with evocative details like "cyan brick walls" and "pixelated moon," enhancing the atmosphere; tone aligns well with the complex deception theme, though sensory details beyond visuals are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue with its central conflict of truth versus deception, and imagery like "crown-shaped teeth" is striking; yet, emotional resonance is limited, dialogue feels somewhat stilted, and the theme lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the retro game setting and necromancer concept offer originality, the villainous princess trope feels predictable without sufficient subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh, but emotional depth relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels intentional; however, it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact, settling for a competent rather than transcendent execution.</comment>
