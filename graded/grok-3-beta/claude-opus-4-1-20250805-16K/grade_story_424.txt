<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Helena's portrayal as a mild zealot is adequately reflected in her intense dedication to research, but her motivations lack deeper emotional nuance; her connection to her grandfather's legacy feels stated rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with the visualization driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between sacrifice and the projections are somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Strange Attractor Laboratory setting is evocative with its rustic refinement, enhancing the tone, though sensory details are sparse and the atmosphere's link to Helena's motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on sacrifice and choice through symbolism of the currency, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt exposition rather than showing; the ending is satisfying yet not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of visualizing forgotten wishes is original, the narrative relies on predictable themes of legacy without subversion; metaphors are fresh but emotions are often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity sometimes limits depth; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
