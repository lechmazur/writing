<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's solitary nature and fierce gentleness are well-integrated into her actions and motivations, particularly in her tender interaction with the plants. However, her inner voice and emotional depth lack sharper definition, making her feel slightly archetypal rather than fully distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to self-expression is clear within the word limit, with the notepad driving the narrative forward. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between Mara’s actions and the broader implications of the garden's memories could be more logically reinforced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is vividly rendered with sensory details like bioluminescent stems and vacuum-grown orchids, enhancing the intimate yet isolated tone. The setting strongly supports the concept of memory, though some sensory elements (e.g., smell, touch) remain underexplored, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through the garden’s grieving and Mara’s final confession, with strong imagery and symbolism in the plants as memory vessels. Yet, the central conflict feels understated, and the theme of connection, while present, lacks a more profound subtext or lingering question to elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of plants holding memories is original, and the writing avoids overt clichés, showing individual style in its poetic leanings. However, some metaphors (e.g., “cellular libraries”) feel slightly overused, and emotional expression occasionally leans toward telling rather than showing, diminishing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive narrative despite multiple elements, with the garden and notepad serving the plot effectively. The brief length feels mostly deliberate, though creative depth is somewhat constrained by surface-level exploration of themes, leaving only a moderate lingering impression.</comment>
