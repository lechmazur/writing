<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s social awkwardness and inventor traits are evident, but his motivations feel slightly underdeveloped; the emotional depth of his family connection is stated rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and hinted resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between decoding and personal revelation lacks tighter causality within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The diner setting during the late shift enhances the lonely, liminal mood effectively, with sensory details like flickering lights; however, the encrypted archive as a setting feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through family secrets and regret, with effective symbolism in the whistle, but the impact is dulled by occasional telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of cryptography and personal confession, some metaphors (e.g., “dying stars”) feel slightly generic, and emotional handling leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the whistle and archive, but the brief length slightly limits depth; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly striking one.</comment>
