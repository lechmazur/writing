<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to preserve ancient traditions through dance is clear, but her character lacks depth beyond this purpose; the unseen observer's presence is intriguing but underdeveloped as a character with unclear motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc with the dance ritual and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the whistle and the whale's call lacks clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly rendered with sensory details like salt memory and cold spots, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the timeframe of the dancer’s first step feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Marina's inherited knowledge, with strong imagery like the lighthouse beam pulsing with her dance; yet, the central conflict feels underdeveloped within the word limit, and the ending lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining dance with maritime tradition, but some metaphors (e.g., "shooting star") are clichéd, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the whistle and dance, but the style occasionally leans toward over-ornamentation, and the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
