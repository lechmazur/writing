<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maera's motivation to bind old wounds is clear and aligns with her quietly defiant nature, but her personality lacks depth beyond the assigned traits, and her voice, while distinct, feels more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness within the word limit, driven by the alignment of stars, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and timeless hush create a compelling atmosphere that supports the tone of borrowed dawn, though sensory details are sparse and could be more evocative to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on displacement and resilience with strong imagery like the glowing tablecloth, but the emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of temporal displacement is unique, some metaphors (e.g., stitching constellations) feel slightly overused, and emotional handling leans toward stated rather than shown nuance, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of defiance, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
