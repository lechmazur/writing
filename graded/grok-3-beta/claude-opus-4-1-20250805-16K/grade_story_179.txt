<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's confidence as a watchman is evident, and his forcibly gentle attribute shapes his interactions, but his deeper motivations feel underexplored; the envy is mentioned but not deeply felt or consistently tied to actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the fingerprint method driving a resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax with the Queenâ€™s dance; cause-effect links are logical yet lack depth in emotional transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant beehive setting is vividly rendered with amber light and honeycomb walls, enhancing the atmosphere of confinement and adaptation; sensory details are effective, though smell and sound could be further emphasized to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on belonging and adaptation, with strong imagery like fingerprints as galaxies; the ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels slightly utilitarian, and the central conflict of yearning lacks visceral tension at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending human and bee patterns, with fresh metaphors like sorrow fermented into honey; however, emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of fingerprints and bee dances; yet, the style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels slightly constraining rather than deliberate.</comment>
