<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s aloofness as an orphan shapes her initial detachment convincingly, and her motivation to transform fear into courage aligns with her past loss, but her emotional shift feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict to fully flesh out her voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to decision is clear within the word limit, with the action of loosening certainty driving the resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the stones’ song and the pathway are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting enhances the eerie atmosphere and ties meaningfully to the stones and concept of adaptation, with sensory details like the hum adding immersion, though other senses (smell, touch) are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional shift and uses metaphors like “distance like a gardener tends roses” effectively, but the central conflict feels underdeveloped within the brief length, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a deeper lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining the anomaly and stones, with fresh imagery, but relies on familiar tropes of loss and discovery without sufficient subversion, and emotional depth sometimes leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, and the brief length feels mostly deliberate, but lacks the profound depth or lingering question needed for top-tier impact, with style occasionally overshadowing clarity.</comment>
