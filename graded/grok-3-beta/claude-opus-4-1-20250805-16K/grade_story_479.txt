<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Margot's glamour and undertaker role are intriguing, but her motivations feel slightly underdeveloped; her shift from dismissal to reverence lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven—key revelations are rushed, and the connection between digital archiving and burial rituals isn't fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere of juxtaposed elegance and death is evocative, with strong imagery of paint and brass, though sensory details are sparse beyond visuals, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought on death and legacy through potent symbolism (measuring tape, elongated measurements), but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional telling over showing; the ending is poignant yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of elongating death as poetry is fresh and avoids clichés, with personal style in the prose, though some metaphors (e.g., "blues that sang") verge on overused; emotional nuance is present but inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering thought on digital legacy, but uneven depth and stylistic flourishes occasionally hinder clarity; it doesn't fully reach top-tier publishability.</comment>
