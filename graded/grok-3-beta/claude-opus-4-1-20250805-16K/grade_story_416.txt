<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Aldric’s duality as a dutiful knight and secret folklore collector, but motivations lack depth; the sudden shift to personal stakes with his brother feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the witch’s introduction; the converging destinies concept drives the story, yet cause-effect links are somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous swamp is vividly rendered with sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone; however, the library ruins feel underutilized as a secondary setting to deepen the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes mild emotional response through shared loss, but lacks profound subtext or memorable uniqueness; dialogue is purposeful yet not particularly natural, and the ending feels more convenient than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is present in combining knightly duty with folklore obsession, but reliance on familiar tropes like the ‘destiny artifact’ and predictable pairing with the witch dilutes freshness; sensory details are specific, though not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but lacks the depth for a lingering impact; style supports clarity, though the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
