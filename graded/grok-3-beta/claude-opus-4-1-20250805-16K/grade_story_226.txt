<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's gloomy nature and craftsman's pride shape his obsessive pursuit of lost songs, but his motivations lack deeper psychological nuance; reactions to the skull feel surface-level rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with the collection of lullabies as the central action, but pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit; connections between beginning and end are logical yet lack a stronger emotional crescendo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance testing facility and timeframe create a unique, haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of haggard awe; sensory details like humming frequencies are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and employs effective metaphors (e.g., orchard as rehearsal), but the ending feels more conceptual than emotionally satisfying; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise with the skull and songs, some metaphors (e.g., seeds in earth) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but lacks deeper human nuance in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the skull and lullabies, but the style occasionally leans toward ornate language over clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
