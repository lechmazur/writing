<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rosa's shaky hands and past trauma are well-integrated into her motivation to make peace with failure, but her emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level; reactions lack nuanced complexity beyond trembling and doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from searching to transformation is clear and cohesive within the word limit, driven by rumor chains, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral as a street artist haven is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like echoing sounds and dying light, enhancing the mood of longing and transformation, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (amber as preserved pain, painting as renewal) evoke emotion and subtext about healing, but the dialogue feels slightly expository, and the central conflict resolves too neatly for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh take on trauma and art, with unique metaphors like the spider gaining wings, but some descriptions (e.g., "broken beauty") verge on clich√©, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative interplay between amber, cathedral, and longing, leaving a lingering thought on transformation, though the brief length slightly constrains emotional resonance and depth.</comment>
