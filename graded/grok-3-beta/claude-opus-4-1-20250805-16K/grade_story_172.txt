<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to outrun the prophecy is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the "unsettled guide" archetype; her reactions feel predictable rather than revealing nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels rushed at key moments, and the connection between the prophecy and her actions could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The giant seashell setting is vividly described and enhances the mystical atmosphere, with strong sensory details like acoustics and mother-of-pearl visuals, though the deserted hallway timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., "frozen fireworks") are striking, but emotional impact is diluted by over-telling of Marina's feelings rather than showing through subtler actions; the ending feels purposeful but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of architectural secrets is original, some metaphors feel forced or overly ornate, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext; the style is distinct but occasionally slips into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements reasonably well, with creative use of the puzzle box and seashell, but cohesion suffers from underdeveloped character depth; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
