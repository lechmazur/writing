<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the plunge and thunder lacks logical grounding despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about identity; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
