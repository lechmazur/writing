<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as a sincere rebel is clear, and her motivation to preserve tradition is consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond this single trait, and her reactions feel predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution, and the action of theorizing fits logically, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect connections are occasionally superficial within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage setting and timeframe between storms are well-integrated, enhancing the mood with sensory details like dust motes and groaning walls, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response and uses imagery effectively, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is satisfying but not profound, and the central conflict feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on familiar tropes of hidden passages and family legacies without significant subversion; sensory details are present but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally borders on overly dramatic; the brief length feels somewhat limiting, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
