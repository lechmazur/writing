<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with mapping as the central action, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the resolution lacks a strong emotional or thematic punch within the word limit, leaving the arc incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly described with sensory details like "ethereal blue glow" and "cathedral of glass," enhancing atmosphere, though the futuristic nostalgia tone sometimes clashes with the mystical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and setting evoke wonder, and thereâ€™s subtext about bridging science and mysticism, but emotional resonance is limited by stated feelings rather than shown depth; dialogue feels purposeful but not always natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the blend of necromancy and science is unique, some metaphors like "cathedral of glass" feel familiar, and emotional portrayal leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres with creative use of elements like necromancy and cave mapping, but it lacks a lingering emotional or intellectual impact, feeling more like a concept sketch than a fully realized piece.</comment>
