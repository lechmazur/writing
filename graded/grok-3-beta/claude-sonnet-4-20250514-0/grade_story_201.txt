<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Melody's impulsiveness and whimsical nature are evident in her actions, but her deeper emotional depth and historical detective role feel underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc and the action of tackling a historical wrong drives the story, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between tracking shooting stars and the resolution is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ruined fortress and waterfall create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of restless harmony; sensory details like the trembling stones and cascading water are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwritten.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Melody's vindication and has a satisfying ending, with imagery like dancing stars adding depth, but the central conflict lacks subtlety, relying on overt emotional statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of music and cosmic elements, some metaphors (e.g., "cosmic approval") feel generic, and the emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the music sheet and fortress, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
