<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s nervousness and insincerity are well-established and drive his transformation, but his inner voice lacks distinctiveness, and his motivation feels slightly generic despite being clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is somewhat superficial, lacking deeper causal links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The bacteria-powered city is vividly realized with strong sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of cautious revelry, though the integration of the setting with Kael’s personal journey could be more emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with Kael’s pursuit of purpose, but literary devices like symbolism are underdeveloped, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly impactful resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
