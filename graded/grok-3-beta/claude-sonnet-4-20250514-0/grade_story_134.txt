<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliza's obnoxiously polite demeanor is distinct and shapes her interactions, but her motivation for cultural research feels underdeveloped and secondary to the plot's supernatural focus. Her reactions reveal little depth beyond surface politeness, missing nuanced growth or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and end, and the action of hindering the crystal's essence drives tension. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between eavesdropping and shadows are underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and laundry cycle timeframe create a unique, evocative contrast, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. Sensory details like humming machines and groaning crystals immerse effectively, though some connections between setting and character motivation feel tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild dread and curiosity, with some imagery like "arthritic joints" standing out. However, the ending lacks punch, dialogue feels overly formal, and deeper themes of cultural evolution are underdeveloped, limiting emotional or intellectual impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of salt divination and oak whispers offers originality, avoiding blatant tropes. Yet, Eliza's politeness borders on caricature, some descriptors feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent. However, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a strength, leaving lingering questions but not profound impact.</comment>
