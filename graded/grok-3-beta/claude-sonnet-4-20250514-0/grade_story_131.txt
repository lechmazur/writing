<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's aloofness and orphan background are well-integrated into her protective shell and reactions to change, but her transformation feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuanced progression in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the gravitational anomaly driving the action, but pacing feels unevenâ€”key emotional shifts are rushed, and the resolution lacks grounding in prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is evocative and enhances the surreal atmosphere, with sensory details like the hum adding immersion, but the garage feels underutilized as a space to deepen mood or character connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maya's shift from fear to courage, with strong imagery like "falling stars in reverse," but the theme of adaptation feels surface-level, lacking deeper subtext or a lingering reflective impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the gravitational anomaly offers an original premise, some metaphors (e.g., "courage tasted like starlight") feel overused, and emotional descriptions occasionally lean toward telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive feel with creative use of elements like the anomaly and stones, but stylistic choices sometimes overreach with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
