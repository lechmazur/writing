<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's stoic nature is well-established and shapes his initial demeanor, but his sudden shift to revolutionary fervor feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual transformation to fully justify the motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the cameo driving a personal awakening, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the miniature uprising and Marcus's revolution lacks clarity, weakening cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is vivid and complements the tone of cynical warmth effectively, enhancing Marcus's isolation; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion beyond visual descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on lost courage and suppressed ideals, with strong symbolism in the cameo and miniatures, but the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying, and the central conflict of personal awakening is underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of cracks in the fa√ßade offers originality, and metaphors like the bird skull cameo are fresh, but emotional resonance relies too heavily on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and the narrative arc feels somewhat predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, particularly the museum setting and cameo, and leaves a lingering thought about personal reinvention, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with underdeveloped depth in style and conflict.</comment>
