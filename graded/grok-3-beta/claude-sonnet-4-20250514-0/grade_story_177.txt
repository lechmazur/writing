<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Magdalena's rebellious nature and unique role as a traveler writing obituaries for the living are intriguing and shape her actions, but her deeper emotional layers and voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit, leaving her motivations feeling somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the pursuit of theatrical necromancy, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the revolution below and her personal uprising is tenuous, disrupting full coherence within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf and hidden chamber create a vivid, atmospheric setting, enhanced by sensory details like groaning books and vibrating pipes; however, the integration of the timeframe with rumors of revolution feels underexplored, slightly diluting the mood's impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its exploration of death and resurrection via theater, with strong imagery and symbolism in the mask and organ, but the emotional resonance is somewhat muted by a lack of deeper subtext or character nuance; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of theatrical necromancy and the mask's changing expressions offer originality, with fresh metaphors like "breathing corpses," though some descriptors (e.g., "beautiful resonance") verge on generic, and emotional depth occasionally feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creatively combined elements like the mask and organ, leaving a lingering question about death's finality, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and stylistic complexity occasionally overshadows clarity.</comment>
