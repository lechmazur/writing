<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters Elara and Morrison are distinct with clear motivations—her scientific obsession and his hidden affection—but their development feels surface-level within the word limit, lacking deeper emotional nuance or backstory to fully flesh out their personalities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the revelation of Morrison’s coded messages, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between butterflies and love messages, while creative, isn’t fully logical or grounded within the narrative’s constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly realized with sensory details like brass fittings and bioluminescent plankton, enhancing the mood of battered marvel; however, the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character-driven tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the unconventional love theme, with effective imagery of copper-winged butterflies, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a sharp, memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of butterflies as message carriers is original, some metaphors (e.g., “steam escaping from valves”) feel overused in steampunk contexts, and emotional expression occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like morse code and migratory butterflies, but the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
