<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to break free from familial expectations and pursue wreck-diving and ghost communication is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond this conflict; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from indecision to rebellion is present but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is evident but lacks nuanced progression, with pacing slightly uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly described with sensory details like "salt-stained air," enhancing the melancholic tone; however, the connection between the amber and setting feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marina's transformation and uses symbolism (amber as trapped expectations) effectively; yet, the dialogue with ghosts feels somewhat expository, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on rebellion and family legacy, some metaphors like "warm honey" feel overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements, with creative use of ghosts and amber, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering feeling of transformation, though not profoundly unique.</comment>
