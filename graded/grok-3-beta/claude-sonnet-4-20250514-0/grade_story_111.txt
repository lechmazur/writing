<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, driven by loss and the need for resurrection, but Marcus's personality feels underdeveloped beyond grief; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the ribbon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and emotional resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the secret dog park is vividly imagined and enhances the ethereal tone; sensory details like crystalline trees and chiming bones immerse effectively, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Emotional impact is strong with the daughter’s return, supported by symbolism of the ribbon and pond; however, subtext is somewhat heavy-handed, and the theme of faith over logic feels overtly stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality in the setting and concept is notable, but reliance on familiar resurrection tropes and somewhat generic descriptors (e.g., “liquid starlight”) dulls uniqueness; emotional nuance exists but lacks subtlety in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the ribbon and park, but style occasionally leans ornate, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering emotional note, though depth feels constrained by explicitness.</comment>
