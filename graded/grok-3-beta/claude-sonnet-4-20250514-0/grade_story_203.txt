<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's stage fright is well-integrated into his personality, shaping his internal conflict and growth, but his transformation from fear to defiance feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the action and the trap's assembly is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is evocatively described and enhances the atmosphere of desolation, with strong sensory details, though the connection to the toy assembly timeframe feels underdeveloped.</comment>
