<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Marcus’s suppressed rage and desire for justice, but his personality lacks depth beyond the tense bodyguard archetype, and his voice feels somewhat generic in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (like acquiring security footage) are underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse setting is vividly realized and enhances the atmosphere of control and isolation, though sensory details are sparse beyond visual descriptions, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marcus’s loss, but relies on stating emotions rather than showing nuanced reactions; symbolism of the greenhouse is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the lunar setting offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of revenge and conspiracy without fresh subversions; emotional resonance feels surface-level and stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought of justice, though lacks deeper stylistic or thematic impact.</comment>
