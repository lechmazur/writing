<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the button and the lovers' story leans on convenient revelation rather than organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The zeppelin library setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood of cosmic longing, with strong sensory details like crystalline walls and humming engines, though some atmospheric elements feel slightly disconnected from the button's role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through the lovers' reunion, with effective imagery and a satisfying ending, but subtext is limited, and the central theme of love's complexity feels somewhat stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
