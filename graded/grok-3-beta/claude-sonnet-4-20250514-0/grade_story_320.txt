<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's shy nature as a diviner is intriguing and shapes her reluctance to share, but her motivation feels somewhat abstract and lacks deeper personal stakes; her voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and the action of precipitating cosmic disasters drives tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution; cause and effect are logical, though some timeline jumps are abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underwater market setting is evocative and enhances the mood of regret and isolation, with strong sensory details like "aquamarine gloom"; atmosphere supports the cosmic imbalance theme, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about choice and transparency, with effective imagery like "coral-branching decisions"; the ending is satisfying, but subtext feels slightly heavy-handed, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
