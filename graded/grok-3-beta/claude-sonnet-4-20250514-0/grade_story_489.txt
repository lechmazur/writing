<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation as an unseen observer and protector of ancient traditions is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond duty-driven actions; her "aggressively kind" attribute feels stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the whale's call driving the rescue narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the dancer's moment lacks meaningful integration into the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting and storm-laden atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details like salt-stained windows and whale songs, strongly supporting the mood, though the timeframe connection to the dancer feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the rescue and tradition theme, with effective imagery like the whale duet, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the lighthouse keeper trope and ancient wisdom motif feel familiar without significant subversion; metaphors like the "endless performance" are evocative but not strikingly original, and emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the whale's call, and the brief length suits the focused rescue narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is modest rather than profound.</comment>
