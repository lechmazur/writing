<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's aloofness and curiosity are well-defined and drive his obsession with the logbook, but his emotional depth and voice remain underdeveloped, lacking nuance in reactions beyond archival zeal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the action of reconstructing Elena’s case, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and some causal links between strike and conspiracy feel underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The port city setting and wounded season create a strong, eerie atmosphere that complements the tone of loss and discovery; sensory details like echoing footsteps enhance immersion, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of justice and reflection through Elena’s legacy, with some effective imagery like “bodies from the deep,” but dialogue feels slightly expository, and subtext is present yet not fully layered; conflict resolution is satisfying but not deeply impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the conspiracy angle offers a fresh take, some metaphors like “corporate veil” feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated purpose than nuanced showing; the style is distinct but occasionally leans toward formal over natural flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, leaving a lingering sense of justice, but the brief length exposes minor gaps in depth, and style occasionally prioritizes complexity over clarity.</comment>
