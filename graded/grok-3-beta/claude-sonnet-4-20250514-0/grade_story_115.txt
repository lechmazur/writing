<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to make amends is clear and drives her actions, but her personality as a curious tinkerer feels underdeveloped beyond the plot's needs; her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical cause-effect progression, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the concept of interconnected wishes is not fully integrated into the narrative's momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nano-scale city setting is vividly rendered and enhances the action, while the toxic atmosphere supports the mood; however, sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elena's redemption arc and employs decent symbolism with the mask, but the conflict resolution feels predictable, and subtext is not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a nano-scale city and wish-network is original, but metaphors like "crystallized regret" feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a truly lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
