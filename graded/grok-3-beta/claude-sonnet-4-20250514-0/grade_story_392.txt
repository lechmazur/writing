<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Magnus's skepticism as a conjurer shapes his internal conflict, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the transition from doubt to belief lacks depth in emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with categorization driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—some reflective moments drag while key revelations are rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The star chart reading room and post-human timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like storm sounds; however, the setting's connection to thimbles feels slightly forced.</comment>
