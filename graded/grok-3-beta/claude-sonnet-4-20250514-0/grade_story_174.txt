<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's role as a wandering fireworks designer shapes her actions and perspective, but her motivation to correct a past regret feels underdeveloped emotionally; it lacks depth in her internal conflict and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution; the connection between the library discovery and fireworks innovation lacks clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hidden library behind a waterfall creates a striking, surreal atmosphere with vivid sensory details like cascading water and frost patterns; however, the integration of the ephemeral timeframe feels slightly forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about memory and artistry through strong imagery and symbolism, but the emotional impact is diluted by telling rather than showing Maya's regret; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of temporal fireworks is intriguing, the story leans on somewhat generic metaphors (e.g., "crystalline formations like frozen thoughts") and lacks nuanced emotional depth, occasionally feeling formulaic in its surrealism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like pressed leaves and frost patterns, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea, though not powerfully so.</comment>
