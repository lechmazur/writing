His voice, while distinct, doesn't fully evolve with his emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from cynicism to transcendence is clear and well-paced within the word limit, driven by the action of sifting through documents, though some causal links between discovery and evolution feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The domed vineyard on a barren alien plain is vividly realized with evocative details like burgundy shadows and bioluminescent vines, enhancing the atmosphere of possibility and supporting Kellan's shift in perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder and prompts reflection on human ambition, with strong imagery like "cupping starlight," but the ending feels slightly pat, and the central conflict of empire versus evolution lacks nuanced tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its take on terraforming and evolution, with fresh metaphors, though some phrases like "rambling destiny" feel overwrought, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
