<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's cheerless nature and duelist background are clear, and his motivation for solitude aligns with his personality, but his emotional shift feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper nuance in his internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from isolation to realization is present but feels compressed within the word limit; the connection between the cookbook and his transformation is logical but lacks sufficient buildup for full impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting and server hum create a haunting atmosphere that complements the bittersweet tone, though sensory details are sparse and could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus's reckoning and has thematic depth about perfection as a flaw, but the impact is diluted by overt telling of emotions rather than showing through nuanced action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and offers a unique blend of sci-fi and personal legacy, some metaphors (e.g., "dust from old pages") feel generic, and emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than layered subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements and leaves a lingering thought about vulnerability, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
