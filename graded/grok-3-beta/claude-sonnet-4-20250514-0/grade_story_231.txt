<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Enkidu’s sentimental nature and spontaneous declarations are present but underdeveloped; motivation for justice is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance or backstory beyond the sister’s death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete with rushed transitions; the action of pursuing justice via coordinates is logical but pacing suffers within word limit, leaving resolution vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of an ancient Sumerian palace is evocative with sensory details like incense, but atmosphere lacks consistent integration with chaotic tone and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through Enkidu’s loss, but symbolism (hairpin, chaos) feels heavy-handed; dialogue is purposeful but not entirely natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in blending chaos with justice, but metaphors like “divine madness” are clichéd; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but feels forced around them rather than organic; lacks lingering depth or stylistic clarity for a prestigious publication.</comment>
