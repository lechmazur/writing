<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's spirited nature and lumberjack background are evident, but her motivations feel underdeveloped and somewhat generic; her transition to a healer lacks deeper personal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the coded letter driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between nightmares and action is not fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is evocative and complements the harsh tenderness tone; sensory details like bone chandeliers are strong, though some atmospheric elements feel underutilized in enhancing character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through future war themes, but lacks nuanced subtext; dialogue is functional but not memorable, and 'showing' often gives way to 'telling' in emotional beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, character reactions lack human nuance, relying on stated feelings; some metaphors like blood pooling are predictable, and the narrative follows a somewhat formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks depth, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
