<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to weave emotional honesty into her art is clear and drives her actions, but her "rationally impulsive" attribute feels underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes her decisions beyond surface mentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a cold-case mystery driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between Mei's performance and solving the murder is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace and post-oil timeframe blend evocatively with "sunlight through debris," enhancing atmosphere, though sensory details are sparse and could further immerse the reader in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Mei's quest for authenticity, and the ending is purposeful, but literary devices like symbolism are predictable, and subtext lacks deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a chameleon actor solving a mystery via performance is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar tropes of hidden evidence and trusted betrayals without fresh subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the dress and sunlight, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
