<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s dutiful nature and jadedness shape her actions, but her motivations shift abruptly from investigation to power-hungry without sufficient buildup, lacking depth in emotional transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the supernatural resolution lacks grounding, disrupting logical flow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes intrigue and has strong imagery (walls hoarding songs), but the ending feels more shocking than satisfying, and subtext on art’s price is intriguing yet underdeveloped within the limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the supernatural twist offers some originality, reliance on familiar horror tropes (ancient predator, stolen essence) without deep subversion, and occasional generic descriptors, diminish uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but rushed resolution and uneven depth prevent a lasting impact, feeling constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
