<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kira's hardheadedness is evident in her stubborn pursuit of transformation over healing, but her motivation feels somewhat surface-level; the depth of her "wholeheartedly broken" state lacks nuanced exploration beyond stated despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains a clear arc within the word limit, with transformation driving the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, but the ending's abruptness undercuts resolution depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ephemeral art gallery and snow days create a haunting atmosphere that complements the tone of loss and transformation; sensory details like frosted windows and snow drifts are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism (melting ice, snow) effectively, but the theme of power's cost feels heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful yet lacks emotional subtlety, relying on overt narration over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of transformation in a vanishing gallery offers originality, some metaphors (liquid starlight) feel generic; emotional handling leans toward stating rather than showing, and the tone wavers slightly at points of high drama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity and deeper impact.</comment>
