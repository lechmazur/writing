<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation for revenge is clear and drives her actions, but her shift to potential forgiveness feels abrupt and underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking depth in her internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution; the trail of photographs drives the story logically, though the final confrontation lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting enhances the atmosphere of desperation and secrecy, and sensory details like "mint-scented fire" are evocative, but the rebellion backdrop feels underexplored and somewhat disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Mira’s vendetta and Veil’s regret, with effective imagery like "melting sugar taking new shape," but the ending lacks impact and deeper subtext; dialogue feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the candy sculptor concept is unique, some metaphors like "information flowed like honey" feel clichéd; emotional nuance is present but not fully realized, and the narrative style lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the locket and market, but the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought of forgiveness, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
