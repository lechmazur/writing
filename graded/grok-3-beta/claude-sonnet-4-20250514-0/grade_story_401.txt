<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s guilt and motivation as a wilderness guide are clear, but her emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level; reactions to the ring and past trauma lack nuanced complexity, relying on overt statements rather than subtle revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between guilt and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the concept of reconciliation drives the story unevenly, with some causality feeling forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken ballroom setting is evocative and supports the atmosphere of loss and introspection, with strong sensory details like filtered sunlight; however, the tone of manic clarity occasionally clashes with the somber mood, diluting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through shared grief and has a satisfying ending, with decent use of symbolism (the ring, blanket); yet, the central conflict feels underexplored, and emotional depth relies more on telling than showing, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise of diaries in a blanket is original, the handling of guilt and reconciliation leans on familiar tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often predictable, and emotional nuance is stated rather than layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the introspective tone; however, it lacks a lingering depth or question, and the style, while clear, doesn’t elevate the narrative to a standout level.</comment>
