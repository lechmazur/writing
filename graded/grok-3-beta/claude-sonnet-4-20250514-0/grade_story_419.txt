<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s empathic nature and blacksmith role shape her actions, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; reactions to the dollhouse are revealing, yet her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between elements are logical, though coherence is strained by abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted Victorian dollhouse museum setting is evocative and enhances the mood, with strong sensory details like prismatic light; however, the post-human timeframe feels underutilized in grounding the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mira’s solitude and the theme of remembrance, with effective imagery like aurora through snow; yet, the ending feels overly optimistic, and conflict resolution lacks depth within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a post-human empathic blacksmith is original, some metaphors (e.g., cosmic dust) feel generic; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
