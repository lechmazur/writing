<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as an insomniac poet shapes her obsessive, sleepless dedication to her cause, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes beyond justice. Her reaction to the botanical samples reveals passion, yet her voice remains somewhat indistinct, missing a unique cadence or perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from whispers to action, with the concept of warnings driving the narrative, but the resolution feels abrupt within the word limit. Pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions between attic and subway, and coherence is strained by the sudden shift to guerrilla art without buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway timeframe create a compelling, eerie atmosphere that supports the tone of empty abundance. Sensory details like the grimy window and rustling specimens enhance immersion, though the connection between setting and botanical samples could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a thoughtful response about environmental loss, with strong imagery like "future ghosts" and a satisfying, purposeful ending. However, the central conflict feels underdeveloped due to limited word count, and the theme of non-violence, while present, lacks deeper subtext or layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining whispers and botanical evidence, with fresh metaphors like "collective memory of a dying landscape." However, some descriptions (e.g., "expensive whiskey") feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated intent than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, reflecting urgency. Creative thinking is evident in linking whispers to environmental memory, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
