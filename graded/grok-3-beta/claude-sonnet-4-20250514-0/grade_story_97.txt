<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to sister's death and empathy quest is clear, but the "fact-minded" trait feels underdeveloped in action; itâ€™s stated but not consistently shown through decisions beyond reliance on the compass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from loss to understanding is present, but pacing feels rushed at the end with the library resolution; causality between visions and empathy feels more symbolic than logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the unstable dimension is vividly surreal with strong imagery like "origami made of starlight," enhancing the emotional quest; sensory details are effective but unevenly distributed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on empathy versus facts, with potent metaphors like the compass pointing to understanding; ending is purposeful but lacks deeper subtext or lingering tension beyond the surface resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While imagery like "whispered minute" is fresh, the emotional journey feels somewhat predictable; character reasoning leans too logical at times, missing nuanced human messiness in grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story coheres around assigned elements, with creative integration of compass and dimension; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and depth feels constrained by length rather than deliberate.</comment>
