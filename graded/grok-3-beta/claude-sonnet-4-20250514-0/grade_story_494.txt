<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s transformation from arrogance to humility is clear, but his motivation feels somewhat surface-level, lacking deeper internal conflict beyond the sudden realization triggered by the song.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from confrontation to epiphany is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, with Kael’s shift in perspective happening too abruptly to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting and moonlight imagery create a strong atmosphere, complemented by sensory details like the wedding song, though the integration of broader world elements feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kael’s realization and uses symbolism like the tapestry effectively, but the dialogue and deeper subtext lack the nuance needed for a truly lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the narrative avoids overt clichés, some metaphors (e.g., “moonlight like captured starfire”) feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated realizations than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style occasionally leans toward overwriting, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength.</comment>
