<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Marcus's social awkwardness is implied but not vividly shown through interactions, and his motivation feels somewhat generic despite the personal regret angle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between decoding messages and carving feels underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The diner setting is evocatively described with sensory details like fluorescent hums, but the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the forgotten arts concept or Marcus's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is middling; while there is some emotional resonance with regret, the writing leans on telling over showing, and the ending lacks a powerful punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of therapeutic whistles, but execution relies on predictable emotional beats about regret, with little nuance or fresh imagery to elevate it beyond formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it integrates elements decently but doesn't leave a lasting impression or exhibit exceptional craft.</comment>
