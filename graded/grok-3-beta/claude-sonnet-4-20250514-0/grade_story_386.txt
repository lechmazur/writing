<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kestra's motivation to revive her forgotten empire is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond her defiance; her "trustworthy strange" attribute feels underexplored in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the catapult action driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the temporal energy concept introduces some logical ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse setting is vivid and enhances the story's mood, with strong sensory details like the atom-core glow, though the timeframe's poetic phrasing feels slightly disconnected from the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic longing and uses symbolism effectively with the tablecloth, but the ending feels more hopeful than satisfying, and emotional depth relies somewhat on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the premise of temporal energy and a lighthouse catapult is original, some metaphors (e.g., "reality tearing") are clich√©d, and emotional expression occasionally lacks nuance, bordering on generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it struggles with depth in character and emotional resonance; the brief length feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
