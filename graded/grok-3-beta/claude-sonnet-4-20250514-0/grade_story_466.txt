<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s morally ambiguous nature is clear, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; the shift to destiny-driven action lacks depth in personal stakes or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but the xerograph activation feels implausible even in a speculative context, and pacing is uneven with rushed revelation at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding forgotten gardens is original, some metaphors (e.g., "burning like promises") feel clichéd, and Marcus’s reasoning lacks nuanced human emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
