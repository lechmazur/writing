<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's loyalty as a scout is evident, and her motivation to find balance through meditation is clear, but her transformation into a radical feels abrupt and lacks depth in emotional nuance; her voice, while distinct, doesn't fully convey the complexity of her internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the action of radicalization driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and the connection between meditation and revolutionary fury at the end lacks clear causality, leaving some coherence gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid, eerie atmosphere of sanctified dread that enhances the mood; sensory details like the moths and glass are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and some emotional response through Maya's struggle, with strong moth imagery and symbolism, but the ending feels more ominous than satisfying; subtext is present but not fully layered, and the theme of inner storms feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story shows originality in combining coded comedy with rebellion, some metaphors (moths as lost souls) feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers slightly, lacking consistent depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the tower and journal, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; the brief length works, yet the lingering impact is moderate, as deeper questions or feelings are not fully explored.</comment>
