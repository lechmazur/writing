<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezequiel's portrayal as a steady gravedigger with a diligently whimsical nature is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth beyond preserving rituals; reactions to the magnifying glass are symbolic yet underexplored in personal terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the concept of overlapping worlds driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between spectral priests and modern actions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Aztec temple setting and timeframe blend effectively, with vivid sensory details like wind through the broken fence and phantom drum beats enhancing atmosphere; however, some details feel repetitive and less impactful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on continuity and ritual, with strong imagery and subtext about preservation, but dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict is subtle to the point of being underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original take on overlapping worlds, some metaphors (e.g., gardeners of the dead) are predictable, and emotional resonance relies more on stated themes than nuanced showing; style is distinct but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about sacred continuity, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
