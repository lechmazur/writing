<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for linguistic preservation is clear and consistent, but Marcus's trickster nature feels underdeveloped; his actions lack a distinct personal voice or nuanced personality beyond the mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, and the action of diverting drones drives the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly realized with sensory details like artificial stars, enhancing the futuristic tone and ghostly resolve, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through the theme of cultural preservation, with some effective imagery, but the conflict feels underdeveloped and the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch; subtext is present but shallow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, leaving a lingering thought about cultural loss, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
