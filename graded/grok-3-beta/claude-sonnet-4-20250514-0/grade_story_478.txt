<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as a critical midwife shapes her actions effectively, and her openly secretive nature adds depth, but her motivation lacks deeper personal stakes beyond the collective loss, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by recovering memories, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between past erasure and present action could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard island in a maelstrom and waxing moon create a vivid, haunting atmosphere, with strong sensory details like salt-tinged air, though the setting’s connection to Mira’s motivation feels under-explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about memory and loss, with effective imagery like "bubbles in deep water," but the ending feels more promising than satisfying, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending midwifery with stolen wisdom, and metaphors are fresh, but some emotional descriptions (e.g., "hollow competence") lean toward telling rather than showing, risking generic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creatively combined elements, leaving a lingering question about collective memory, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
