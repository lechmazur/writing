<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Captain Zara's motivation to preserve her father's legacy and the flying libraries is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular focus; her spiritually secular attribute feels mentioned rather than integrated into her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit with a clear decision point, but the pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between coffee stain reading and the ultimate choice lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly described with sensory details like dust and echoes, enhancing the mood of loss; however, the atmosphere occasionally overpowers the character's personal stakes with excessive focus on the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through themes of preservation and loss, with strong imagery like coffee stains as constellation maps; yet, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the conflict resolution lacks a deeper subtextual punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a lingering sense of hope, and the elements are mostly in service of the narrative; however, the style occasionally leans into ornate language that detracts from clarity and impact.</comment>
