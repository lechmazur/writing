<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prince Kael's motivation to cure loneliness is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the archetype of a brooding exiled noble; reactions to the mortar and pestle are symbolic but not revelatory of unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the snowstorm drives the encounter effectively, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of isolation, with evocative sensory details like swirling snow; however, the setting’s connection to the mortar feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kael’s journey, and the ending is purposeful, but dialogue feels slightly stilted; symbolism of the mortar is present but lacks deeper subtext or thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of an exiled prince healing through herbs offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of redemption and return without subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length suits the arc, but it lacks a lingering depth or truly creative integration of elements to elevate it beyond a competent draft.</comment>
