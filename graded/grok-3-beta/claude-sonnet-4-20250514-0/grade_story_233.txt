<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's naivety as a summoner is implied but not deeply explored; her motivation tied to grief is clear but lacks nuanced development within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between action and concept is somewhat surface-level.</comment>
