<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to preserve and release is clear, tied to her ghostly encounters and the flower crown, but her personality lacks depth beyond situational reactions; her voice is indistinct despite emotional context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the leak crisis, but pacing feels rushed in emotional beats, and the ghost tours method feels disconnected from the central action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is evocatively strange, enhancing the tone of loss and preservation, with strong sensory details like dripping water; however, the lunch break timeframe feels underutilized in atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the interplay of preservation and letting go, with effective symbolism in the flower crown, but the conflict resolution feels slightly pat, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the premise is unique, the ghostly guide trope and emotional resolution lean on familiar patterns without subversion; metaphors like “eternal dance” feel slightly generic, though emotional nuance is present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of sand castles and ghosts, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
