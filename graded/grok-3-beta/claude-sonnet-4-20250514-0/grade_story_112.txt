<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear and consistent, driving her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular focus; her “factually imaginative” attribute feels underexplored in shaping a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from aimlessness to purpose, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between noting patterns and recipe preservation, while creative, strains coherence at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is evocatively described with strong sensory details like dust motes and amber light, enhancing the mournful tone and supporting Maya’s mission, though the timeframe metaphor feels slightly forced and disconnected from the physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Maya’s connection to her grandmother and cultural loss, with effective symbolism in the handkerchief, but the ending feels somewhat predictable; dialogue is natural yet limited, and subtext on cultural erasure is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of encoding recipes in a hopscotch board is original, the emotional resonance relies on stated feelings over nuanced showing; metaphors like “snowflake melts on warm skin” feel slightly generic, and the narrative arc borders on predictable despite creative elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a clear transformation from wandering to mission, and assigned elements are generally in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally leans ornate, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought on cultural preservation but lacks deeper complexity.</comment>
