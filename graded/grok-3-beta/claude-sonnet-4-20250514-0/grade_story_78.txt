<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s transformation from groundskeeper to reluctant leader is compelling, with clear motivation tied to survival and responsibility, but her inner conflict as an impostor feels underexplored within the word limit, missing deeper nuance in her voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc—tracking raiders to reclaim seeds—driven by Mira’s actions, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, lacking space for tension to build fully within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic rooftop farm setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the cold brass spyglass and skeletal cityscape, enhancing the atmosphere of loss and desperation, though some sensory elements remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on survival and hope through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue is sparse and some emotional beats are told rather than shown, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the narrative offers a fresh take on a post-apocalyptic hero, some metaphors (e.g., "morning dew on spider silk") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the spyglass and rooftop farm, leaving a lingering thought about sacrifice, though the brief length slightly constrains deeper exploration of themes and character.</comment>
