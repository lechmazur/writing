<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cordelia’s motivation to save her family estate is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond her aristocratic background and desperation; her voice feels somewhat generic despite the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the revelation of recipes; cause and effect are logical, yet the ending lacks a stronger resolution to tie the supernatural elements to her decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like ghostly music and whispers, enhancing the eerie atmosphere; however, the connection between the setting and Cordelia’s motivation occasionally feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of tension and legacy’s weight through imagery and subtext, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-explained motivations; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to abrupt closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a haunted park and alchemical secrets shows originality, some metaphors (e.g., “burden of legacy pressed down like the storm”) feel predictable; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown through nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally leans toward over-dramatization, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of legacy, though not powerfully enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
