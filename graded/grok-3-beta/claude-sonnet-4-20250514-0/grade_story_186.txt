<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gideon's motivation to chronicle environmental changes is clear and consistent, and his whimsical tinkerer nature is reflected in his dedication to sculpting data, but his personality lacks depth beyond this single drive; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with sculpting driving the narrative as a symbolic act, but pacing feels uneven—key moments are rushed while descriptive passages linger; cause and effect of the melting palace are clear, yet the ending lacks a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace setting is evocative and enhances the sense of impending doom, with sensory details like creaking ice and crystal light adding immersion; however, the atmosphere occasionally feels repetitive, and the timeframe integration is underutilized in mood-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a somber emotional response and uses symbolism effectively (thermometer as time’s heartbeat), with a clear theme of witnessing collapse; yet, dialogue feels stilted at times, and the conflict resolution is more implied than impactful within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique blend of science and mysticism, with fresh metaphors like mercury as liquid fire; however, some sensory details are generic, and emotional nuance is occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the thermometer and fortune-tellers, and the brief length suits the focused narrative; yet, overly descriptive style sometimes hinders clarity, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
