<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters Marcus and Elena are defined by aloofness and passion respectively, but their emotional depth feels surface-level; motivations are clear but lack nuanced development within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the emotional climax, and the temporal crossroads concept is underexplored, disrupting coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The futuristic mall setting is intriguing and ties to the cartographer role, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional stakes or tone of eager resignation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the cracked tile symbolism, and dialogue feels purposeful, but subtext is shallow, and the theme of memory ties is stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the futuristic mall and cartographer role offer some originality, the emotional narrative leans on predictable romance tropes without subversion, and metaphors like "mapping the territory of connection" feel overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering idea of memory, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
