<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with dream-editing as a logical action, though pacing feels slightly rushed and the resolution lacks emotional weight or surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fern orchard and waterfall setting, paired with piano practice, creates a vivid atmosphere that enhances the dreamlike tone; sensory details are evocative, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers some thematic depth with the balance between dreams and reality, but it struggles to evoke strong emotion or linger memorably; imagery is strong, yet the conflict feels somewhat clinical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like moon-paths and piano practice, but it lacks a profound lingering impact or stylistic clarity to elevate it to top-tier status.</comment>
