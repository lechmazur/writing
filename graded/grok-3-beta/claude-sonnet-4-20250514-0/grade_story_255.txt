<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya’s portrayal as a nondescript seer with analytical innovation is intriguing, but her inner motivations lack depth beyond the surface quest for truth; her reactions to the USB drive and rain are telling but not revelatory of deeper personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution within the word limit, driven by the action of untangling truth; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the surprise party distraction feels underutilized as a narrative device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower and post-party hush create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like petrichor; yet, the setting’s connection to delayed justice feels more functional than deeply symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on justice and truth, with solid imagery like rain as renewal, but lacks a visceral emotional punch; the ending is purposeful but not striking, and the central conflict, while present, resolves too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés and offers a fresh take on a conspiracy plot, but some descriptors (e.g., “quiet fire”) feel generic; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and the tone wavers slightly between cynicism and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like rain and the USB drive, leaving a lingering question of justice’s impact; however, the style occasionally leans on predictable phrasing, missing a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
