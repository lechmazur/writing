<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear, with Kenji’s longing and subtle actions driven by past connection, but depth feels surface-level; Yuki remains underdeveloped, lacking distinct voice or agency beyond reacting to Kenji’s gaze.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution despite word constraints, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause-effect links are logical, though meteor decoding as plot driver strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting of the mountain and reimagined castle integrates well with tone of distant intimacy, enhanced by vivid meteor imagery; sensory details are present but uneven, lacking depth in non-visual elements like smell or touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes longing through subtle imagery and symbolism of meteors, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; ending is satisfying yet predictable, with minimal subtext or lingering thematic depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the meteor-flower decoding concept, but reliance on romantic longing trope feels formulaic without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh, though some emotional descriptions lack nuance and specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; brief length feels deliberate, though depth is sacrificed, leaving impact somewhat fleeting.</comment>
