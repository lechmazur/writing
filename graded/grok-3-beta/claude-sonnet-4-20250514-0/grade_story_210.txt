<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Elena's amiability is mentioned but not shown through interactions, and her motivation to fuse lore with modern dreams feels stated rather than deeply felt or demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed toward the end, and the connection between waiting for news and the mystical experience is underdeveloped, missing a stronger causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly portrayed with strong sensory details like creaking timbers and ocean winds, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of mystery and supporting the tone of humble rebellion, though some details feel slightly overdone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes a mild emotional response through Elena's resolve, with decent use of symbolism (timbers as storytellers), but the ending feels more declarative than impactful, and the central conflict of academic validation versus mysticism lacks sharper tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, some metaphors (wooden bones, heartbeat of timbers) feel familiar and not entirely fresh; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, and the narrative style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the lighthouse and timbers, but the style occasionally leans toward overwriting, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, missing a deeper lingering impact.</comment>
