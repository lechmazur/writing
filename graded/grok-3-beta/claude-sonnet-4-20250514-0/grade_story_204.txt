<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Mayaâ€™s role as a professional cuddler shaping her empathetic responses, but her motivations lack deeper exploration within the word limit. Her voice is distinct in dialogue, though internal thoughts are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed toward the resolution. The connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a stronger emotional payoff due to limited space for buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like rusted gates and market hum, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and renewal. The tone of ancient novelty complements the setting, though some connections to character motivation feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of connection and prejudice, with effective symbolism in the phantom punch. However, dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural flow at times, and the central conflict resolves too neatly for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining a futuristic setting with a unique profession, but some metaphors (e.g., decay of prejudice) feel slightly overused. Emotional resonance is present but relies occasionally on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about human connection. However, style occasionally leans toward overwriting, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength.</comment>
