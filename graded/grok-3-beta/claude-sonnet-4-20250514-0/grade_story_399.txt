<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Erasmus’s grumpy nature as a crypt caretaker is clear, and his motivation to quell inner turmoil is consistent, but his emotional transformation feels slightly abrupt given the limited word count, lacking deeper nuance in his voice or reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a complete arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—sand mandala creation dominates, while the emotional resolution is rushed. Logical flow is maintained, though trauma’s role as a concept could be more tightly woven into the action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The witch’s crystal scrying room and stargazing timeframe are vividly described and enhance the mystical atmosphere, supporting the tone and action. Sensory details are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Erasmus’s pain and healing, with strong symbolism in the mandala. However, the ending feels slightly didactic, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks natural cadence. Subtext is present but could be more subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés and shows originality in the mandala’s role, but some descriptions (e.g., “restless spirits”) feel generic. Emotional handling is nuanced at times, yet occasionally stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers slightly toward melodrama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mandala and trauma, leaving a lingering reflection on healing. However, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
