<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ancient temple setting enhances the atmosphere of transformation, with evocative imagery of crumbling domes and moonlight, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "tectonic plates realigning" feel generic, and the narrative lacks a truly unique voice or surprising twist, leaning on predictable transformation tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with a lingering theme of renewal, and assigned elements are generally in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity.</comment>
