<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambassador Chen's confusion and evolving empathy are portrayed with some depth, particularly in his internal conflict over immigration policies, but his motivations feel slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit, lacking a distinct personal voice or nuanced reaction to the spare key beyond its symbolic role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc from confusion to clarity, driven by the action of liberalizing, but the pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between the spare key and the broader narrative resolution is tenuous, undermining full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like crystalline glow and mineral walls, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of displacement and isolation, though the connection between setting and the spare key feels somewhat incidental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through Chenâ€™s transformation and employs effective symbolism with the starlings, but the theme of collective wisdom feels slightly heavy-handed, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharp, lingering impact due to overt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of evolutionary wisdom tied to starling patterns offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar refugee and diplomat tropes without significant subversion, and emotional descriptions occasionally state rather than show nuanced depth, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its assigned elements with moderate success, showing creative intent in linking starlings to human patterns, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate strength, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
