<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation to master an ancient art through distortions is intriguing but underdeveloped; his subdued vigilante trait feels more implied than embodied in action or voice, lacking distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, connecting past trauma to present coping, but pacing feels uneven with heavy focus on internal reflection over action; coherence is maintained, yet the concept’s influence on plot direction is vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area enhances the melancholic tone and complements the price of war concept; sensory details are present but not fully vivid; atmosphere supports Marcus’s motivation effectively through isolation and decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on trauma’s lasting impact with strong mirror imagery and subtext, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a sharper punch; dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the mirror distortion metaphor is fresh, the story leans on familiar veteran trauma tropes without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but not deeply shown; style is individual but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced; style supports clarity but brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought on war’s silent burden, showing creative intent.</comment>
