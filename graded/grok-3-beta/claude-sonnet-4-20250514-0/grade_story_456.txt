<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation to understand cosmic cycles aligns with his morbid florist background, but his "neutrally passionate" attribute feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of obliging the master's request driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting is vividly rendered with cosmic winds and stone platforms, enhancing the atmosphere of mystery, though sensory details could be more varied beyond visual imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on cycles of life and death with effective symbolism (candle, flowers, stars), but the dialogue feels slightly stilted and the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the brief format.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the cosmic dojo and florist perspective offer originality, some metaphors (e.g., "stellar dust") feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated insights than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the candle and cosmic cycles, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language, slightly hindering clarity and depth of impact.</comment>
