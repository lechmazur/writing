<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Marcus’s shift from cynical thief to poet feels abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or gradual progression. Motivation is clear but not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc, with a beginning and resolution, but the transformation feels rushed and slightly implausible within the tight timeframe, disrupting pacing and coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone, effectively supporting the atmosphere and concept of transformation, though sensory details could be more specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through Marcus’s vulnerability, and the theme of transformation is present, but the dialogue with the dummy feels slightly forced, and the ending lacks deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story offers some originality in combining a pickpocket with a supernatural dummy, but relies on predictable transformation tropes without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and the impact is moderate without a truly lingering thought or depth.</comment>
