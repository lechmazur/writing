<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's unease as an emissary is evident, but his motivation feels underdeveloped; the coathanger's emotional weight is clear, yet his actions lack depth in connecting to his diplomatic role. His voice is distinct but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the beginning and end feels slightly forced. Pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolutions, and the concept of redemption isn't fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris tracking station is evocative and complements the theme of chaos, but sensory details are sparse. The atmosphere supports Marcus's motivation, though the contrast between high-tech and domestic elements feels inconsistent at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's realization, and metaphors like debris as failure are effective but not striking. Dialogue is purposeful but lacks natural flow. The theme of redemption is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, the redemption arc feels predictable. Metaphors are fresh in places but occasionally overextended. Emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, lacking a truly unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, but they sometimes feel forced into the narrative. The style is clear but not distinctive, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice. It leaves a lingering thought, but not a profound one.</comment>
