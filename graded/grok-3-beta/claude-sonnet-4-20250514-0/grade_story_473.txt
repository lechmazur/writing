<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra's eccentricity as a cartographer is evident, and his motivation to lead a resistance is clear, but his inner conflict and personal voice remain underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a subtle arc with pruning as a metaphor for rebellion, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and some cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The urban orchard under solar panels is vividly realized and complements the tone of bittersweet grit, though sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about systemic change and uses pruning as effective symbolism, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper personal stakes; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of hidden rebellion is original, some metaphors (e.g., "grow something better") feel slightly overused; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally states rather than shows feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion and shows creative intent, but the brief length feels somewhat limiting, and the lingering impact is thoughtful yet not profound enough for top-tier status.</comment>
