<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s daring as a pathfinder and his ingenious cluelessness are evident, shaping his obsessive pursuit, but his internal voice lacks depth, and motivations feel surface-level, missing nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc achieves a sense of completeness with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and cause-effect links between housekeeping logs and the roller coaster are tenuous, lacking logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned roller coaster setting is evocatively described with sensory details like rusted rails and fog, enhancing the eerie tone of quiet mania, though the connection to housekeeping logs feels forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (roller coaster as reality’s framework) and imagery (starlight portal) creates impact, but emotional resonance is shallow, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying punch; conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the cosmic housekeeping concept offers originality, some metaphors (tracks meeting sky) feel overused, and emotional portrayal leans on explicit statements rather than nuanced showing, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but lacks the depth to leave a lasting impression; style supports clarity but doesn’t elevate beyond functional storytelling.</comment>
