<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina’s free-spirited nature and academically artistic trait are evident, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance; her reaction to the sewing kit reveals personal history, yet her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
