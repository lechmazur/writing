<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Magnus's motivation to embody his values as a brewer is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the groggy, rebellious archetype; his voice feels functional rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; the connection between protest and personal transformation is logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting enhances the tone of flippant solemnity and supports the encroaching darkness concept; sensory details are evocative, though some descriptions border on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Magnus’s defiance, with effective metaphors like brewing revolution; however, the ending feels predictable, and subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story shows some originality in linking brewing to rebellion, it leans on familiar haunted mansion tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often expected, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; however, it lacks a truly lingering impact or profound depth.</comment>
