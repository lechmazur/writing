<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious and rebellious nature is well-captured through his actions and motivations, but his inner world lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice beyond the archetype of a misunderstood visionary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a satisfying resolution within the word limit, driven by the translation action and celestial alignment, though pacing feels slightly rushed toward the climax, missing some build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and comet create a haunting, evocative atmosphere that enhances the tone of deliberate wilderness and supports the hermit's motivation, with strong sensory details like the trembling ground and moonlit darkness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on patience and hope through potent symbolism (pressed flowers, barren ground), with a satisfying ending, though the central conflict feels understated and lacks sharper tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique take on renewal, some metaphors (e.g., "deeper alchemy") feel slightly overused, and emotional depth is shown rather than told but lacks the raw human nuance needed for true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the comet and weathervane, leaving a lingering thought about perseverance, though the style occasionally verges on ornate, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
