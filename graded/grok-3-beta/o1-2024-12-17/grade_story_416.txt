<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Sir Maldon's straight-laced nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to collect urban legends feels tacked on rather than intrinsic to his personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the action of verifying the shell's authenticity drives the story minimally, and the pacing feels rushed at the end. The arc lacks a strong resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The luminous swamp setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, but its connection to the characterâ€™s motivation and the timeframe feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or subtext; the central conflict is weak, and the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying. Imagery is present but not impactful enough to elevate the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by predictable tropes of knights and relics; language feels overly formal at times, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic. The story lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
