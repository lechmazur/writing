<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's dry wit is present but underdeveloped; it serves as a shield but lacks distinct voice or depth in action. Motivation to learn traditional methods is clear but feels secondary to the setting's mystique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the dance as a unifying goal, but pacing feels rushed at the end. Connection between beginning and end is present but lacks a strong causal link; coherence is maintained, though some transitions are abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse bedroom enhances the eerie tone and supports the concept of eroding promises effectively. Sensory details like salt-stained wallpaper and flickering lantern are evocative, though some descriptions feel repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with the dance and promises, but emotional impact is muted. Symbolism of rope and dance is present but not fully explored; ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance. Conflict is clear but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining dance with haunted promises, but reliance on ghostly tropes feels predictable. Metaphors like "ghosts of forgotten expectations" are overused; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative rather than serve it. Style is clear but lacks distinct flair; length feels like a constraint, and lingering impact is minimal despite creative intent.</comment>
