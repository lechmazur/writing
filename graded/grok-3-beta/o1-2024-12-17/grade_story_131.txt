<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Farah's aloofness and orphan status are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to transform fear into courage feels surface-level and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the stones.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the gravitational anomaly driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between stones and anomaly are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is intriguing and ties to the mood, but sensory details are sparse beyond "softly audible hum," limiting immersion; atmosphere supports motivation unevenly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance and symbolism with stones as lighthouses, but subtext is shallow, and the ending feels predictable; conflict resolution lacks impact due to overt telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of stones and anomaly shows some originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of self-discovery without subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
