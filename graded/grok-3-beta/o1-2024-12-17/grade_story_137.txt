<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels forced in connecting the binder clip to the resolution; pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions disrupting coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting of the temple in the clouds is evocative and supports the tone of doleful cheer, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion and connection to the character’s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through themes of sorrow and hope, but overreliance on telling rather than showing diminishes impact; ending feels purposeful yet lacks memorability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but metaphors like “understory grows” feel repetitive and generic; emotional handling lacks nuance, relying on stated feelings over subtext.</comment>
