<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but feels forced within the word limit; connections between denial, prophecy, and dance are vague, leading to uneven pacing and a rushed resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with dance and the patch, but emotional impact is muted by repetitive telling over showing; ending feels predictable and lacks a resonant punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d prophecy and family secret tropes without subversion; writing feels formulaic with generic descriptors like "hidden truths," lacking a distinct authorial voice or fresh imagery.</comment>
