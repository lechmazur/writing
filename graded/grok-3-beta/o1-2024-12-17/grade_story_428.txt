<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; Alric's shift from city planner to doomsday prepper feels underexplored, and his "rarely authentic" trait is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; the action of studying constellations drives the story, but connections between past and present are vague, and pacing stumbles with repetitive introspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative with flickering torches and murals, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the tone of daring caution, missing deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with the ink blotter, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; conflict is present but lacks tension, and the ending feels more abrupt than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing shows repetitive phrasing (e.g., "daring caution") and generic descriptors; metaphors like the ink blotter as cleansing feel forced, and emotional resonance is stated rather than felt, suggesting formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style lacks clarity with overwritten passages; brevity feels like a limitation, and creative depth is shallow, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
