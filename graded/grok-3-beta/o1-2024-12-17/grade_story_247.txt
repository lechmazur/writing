<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The weathered poet's character is somewhat defined by a quest for sacred flows, but the motivation feels abstract and lacks depth in personal stakes or backstory. Reactions to the makeup compact are intriguing but underdeveloped, failing to fully reveal inner conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the poet's journey through the labyrinth, but the action of mapping sacred flows feels vague and disconnected from a concrete resolution.
