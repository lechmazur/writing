<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The jumpy necromancer's anxiety is evident, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; motivation to unmask the icon is clear but feels surface-level without nuanced emotional stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between actions and outcomes are logical, though some transitions are abrupt and lack clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly described with pixelated imagery, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are unevenly applied; the tone of mystery fits, yet lacks deeper emotional grounding in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with themes of betrayal and liberation, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying due to rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While the concept of a necromancer in a digital world is intriguing, the execution relies on familiar tropes of false gods without fresh subversion; metaphors like "marionette on tangled strings" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; creative thinking is present but undermined by inconsistent depth and stylistic clarity.</comment>
