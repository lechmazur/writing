<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The living statue's telepathic ability and tragically joyful nature are intriguing, but its motivation to find truth feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in action; the calligrapher's sincerity is a highlight, though her character remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the statue's quest and the calligrapher's arrival feels forced; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolutions undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city square is vividly described with sensory details like hissing valves and scalding steam, enhancing the gloomy cheerfulness; however, the setting's connection to character motivation feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the statue's longing and the hair tie's symbolism, but subtext is shallow; literary devices like the mosaic of longing are effective yet overexplained, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a telepathic statue is unique, the narrative leans on predictable themes of truth versus deceit without subversion; language occasionally veers into purple prose, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; the style is evocative yet overelaborate, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
