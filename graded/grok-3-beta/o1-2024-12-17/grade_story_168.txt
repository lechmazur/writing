<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode rock art is clear, but the "ruthless" trait feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance; Cressida's personality lacks a distinct voice despite unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect links between road trip and stone circle discoveries are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and supports the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and the scuffed comb feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story has some subtext with the watcher's burden, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; ending feels purposeful but not deeply satisfying; dialogue lacks natural flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a ruthless flower arranger is unique, the narrative relies on predictable quest tropes without subversion; metaphors like "lilies as weapons" feel overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced into the narrative rather than integral; lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond surface intrigue.</comment>
