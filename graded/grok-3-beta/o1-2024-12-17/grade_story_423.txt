<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The earnest knight's motivation to spark flames in a land of ice is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond generic nobility; reactions to the map and greenhouse feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the greenhouse mapping driving the story forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined aqueduct and desert setting effectively enhance the tone of nostalgia and desolation, with vivid sensory details of dust and light, though the connection to the timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through nostalgia, with decent use of symbolism (canvas of life), but the ending lacks punch, and the theme feels somewhat forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, metaphors like "canvas of life" feel overused and generic; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced subtext or fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
