<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of gathering broken pieces is intriguing, the execution leans on familiar redemption tropes without fresh subversion; metaphors like "corroded rapture" feel forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than integral; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
