<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lillian's role as a radio host who channels the dead is intriguing, but her motivations feel surface-level and lack depth; her reactions to the chessboard are symbolic but not emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the cooking class run-in and the grotto exploration is tenuous, disrupting coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a radio host channeling the dead is unique, the narrative relies on predictable spiritual tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style is overly ornate at times, and the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
