<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems is clear, but the hushed necromancer's personality lacks depth beyond surface traits; the baseball cap feels like a superficial quirk rather than a revealing element.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the exploration leading to a grand cavern, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and the action of domination is vague and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone, but the connection between setting and character motivation feels somewhat forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Reliance on generic descriptors and overused metaphors (e.g., "glimmer of knowledge") detracts from originality; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
