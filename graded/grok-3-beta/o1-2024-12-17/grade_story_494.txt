<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the swordsman’s arrogance and doubtfully confident nature are stated but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice or nuanced growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the connection between beginning and end lacks depth within the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while there’s some emotional resonance and symbolism with the tapestry, the writing often tells rather than shows, and the ending lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Originality suffers from predictable character tropes and generic descriptors; emotional handling lacks nuance, and the narrative follows a somewhat formulaic redemption arc without fresh twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired; assigned elements are integrated but not in a way that feels essential or innovative, leaving little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
