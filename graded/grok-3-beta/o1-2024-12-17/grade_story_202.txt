<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Marisol's role as a careful poisoner is intriguing, but her motivations lack depth and clarity; the "innocently guilty" trait feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt drives the plot, but the story feels incomplete within the word limit, with an unclear resolution and rushed pacing that undermines the arc's potential impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The found object museum setting is evocative and complements the dusty starlight tone, with sensory details like dust and echoes enhancing atmosphere, though the skateboarders feel disconnected from the core mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some imagery (dusty starlight, cracked hilt) adds depth, but the story lacks a strong emotional response or clear central conflict; it tells more than shows, diminishing overall impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style often feels overwrought, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
