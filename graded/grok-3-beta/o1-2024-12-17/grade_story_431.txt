<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's introverted nature and dancer background are present but underdeveloped; motivation to escape is clear but lacks depth in emotional grounding or specificity, feeling somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with decoding leading to escape, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and connections between knitting, charts, and ciphers are forced and lack logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting of the cipher decoder's office is intriguing and ties to the action, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the desolate wasteland motif or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story attempts symbolism with knitting and stars, but emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing; ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, lacking a deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Writing relies on repetitive phrases like "forgotten echoes" and generic descriptors; metaphors are overused and predictable, lacking originality, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from forced connections; style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and depth beyond the surface narrative is minimal.</comment>
