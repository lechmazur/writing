<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in concept, but relies on predictable rebellion tropes and generic descriptors; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with assigned elements, but style is overly ornate at times, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; lacks lingering depth.</comment>
