<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around non-violence is clear but lacks depth; the insomniac poet's personality feels underdeveloped beyond surface traits, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; connections between actions and resolution are logical but lack impactful progression, with pacing uneven due to overemphasis on atmosphere over conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of empty abundance is evocative and ties well to the haunted attic, but sensory details are sparse and inconsistently vivid, limiting immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response through themes of compassion, but literary devices like imagery are repetitive; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a strong lingering impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but relies on predictable tropes of haunted spaces and poetic redemption; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, lacking nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
