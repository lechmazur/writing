<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aspen’s morbid florist identity is intriguing, but his motivations and reactions lack depth and specificity; the "neutrally passionate" attribute feels inconsistently applied and doesn't fully shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of obliging cosmic lessons feels vague and underdeveloped; pacing is uneven, with rushed revelations and a lack of clear cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is visually striking and complements the cosmic theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports Aspen’s motivation; the timeframe of the guttering lantern adds mood but isn’t fully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with cosmic cycles and mortality, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels more predictable than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a morbid florist seeking cosmic truths is unique, the execution relies on generic descriptors and stated emotions rather than nuanced subtext; metaphors like the black blossom feel forced, and the tone shifts unnaturally at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style lacks clarity and impact, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
