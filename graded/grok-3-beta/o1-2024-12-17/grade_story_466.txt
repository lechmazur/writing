<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's morally ambiguous nature and cunning are present but underdeveloped; motivation to corner destiny feels vague and lacks depth in execution, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with decoding driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Smoke signal tower setting enhances the mysterious tone and complements the concept of forgotten secrets; sensory details like dust and burnt signals are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story hints at deeper themes of control over nature, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, metaphors like "gentle chaos" feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on predictable patterns without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and lingering impact is limited by surface-level exploration.</comment>
