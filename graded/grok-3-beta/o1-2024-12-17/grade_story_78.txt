<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the late-blooming hero's resolve tied to loss, but the "softly militant" attribute feels underexplored and lacks depth in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the spyglass driving cosmic inquiry, but pacing feels uneven, and some cause-effect links, like survivor recruitment, are vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the cosmic balance theme and hero's journey lean on familiar tropes without subversion; metaphors like "cosmic tides" feel generic, lacking fresh nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or truly innovative thought.</comment>
