<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around humility and overcoming limits is clear, but the sleepy nomad lacks a distinct voice or depth beyond the thematic lesson; reactions to objects feel symbolic rather than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced within the word limit; pacing is uneven with rushed transitions, and cause-effect links between disguise and resolution are vague.</comment>
