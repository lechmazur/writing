<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Calder's motivation to track migratory butterflies is intriguing but lacks depth in execution; his personality feels underdeveloped beyond eccentric traits, and his voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit, with the butterfly quest driving the story unevenly; coherence suffers from abrupt shifts between personal mission and broader themes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the battered marvel tone, but the atmosphere only partially supports Calder's motivation, lacking deeper integration with the sea's mystique.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance through Calder's hope, with some effective imagery, but the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharpness; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of butterflies as peace symbols is creative, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of redemption without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or truly innovative thought beyond surface themes.</comment>
