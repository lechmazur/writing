<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is imaginative but disjointed; the transition between reality and fantasy feels abrupt, and the arc lacks a strong resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with evocative imagery of the grocery store and cloud cafe, but sensory details are unevenly distributed, weakening immersion at times.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is present in the surreal elements, but the narrative relies on overused tropes of longing and escapism without fresh subversion; some metaphors feel generic and forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative promise but lacks cohesion; assigned elements are integrated with mixed success, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity.</comment>
