<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Riven's sincerity as a rebel is clear, and his motivation to preserve building traditions aligns with his actions, but his personality lacks depth or a distinct voice; reactions to the sticky note feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with theorizing driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels unevenâ€”some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily; coherence is maintained, though cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The haunted secret passage and timeframe between storms work well together, creating a brooding atmosphere; sensory details like flickering lanterns and damp chills are evocative, though some descriptions lack specificity; tone supports the concept effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Riven's confrontation of fear, and the shifting passage as a metaphor for inner turmoil is intriguing, but the ending feels predictable; writing style is competent but lacks standout impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a shifting haunted passage offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar gothic tropes without subversion; sensory details are occasionally generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but unremarkable; the brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice; it leaves a faint lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
