<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the seer's "innocent cynicism" and analytical nature are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to unearth the relic feels generic and lacks personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc but feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between the USB drive and delayed justice is tenuous, and pacing suffers from overpacked exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned control tower setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of secrecy, but sensory details like "scent of first rain" feel forced and disconnected from the physical environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional depth or memorable impact; imagery like rain and fortresses is present but feels clich√©d, and the central conflict of uncovering truth is underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is undermined by generic metaphors (rain as cleansing) and predictable conspiracy tropes; writing style feels overly ornate with phrases like "righteous precision," lacking authentic voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style's complexity hinders clarity without leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
