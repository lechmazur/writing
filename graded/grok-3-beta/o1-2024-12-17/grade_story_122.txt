<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the cyber-templar's "patiently frantic" nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or inner conflict, making the portrayal feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the bridle and storm-riding feels forced and underexplained, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details of the storm and sky burial site, enhancing the mood, but the setting's connection to the character’s motivation feels tenuous and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional impact through the templar’s defiance, but overreliance on explicit emotion ("euphoric agitation") rather than showing through subtext weakens craft; ending lacks lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable storm-battle trope; metaphors like "fractured rainbows" feel overused, and emotional portrayal lacks nuanced subtext, suggesting formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
