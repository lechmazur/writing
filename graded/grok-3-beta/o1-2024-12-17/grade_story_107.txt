<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The insect symphony hall is vividly described with bioluminescent beetles, enhancing atmosphere, but sensory details are inconsistently applied, and the desert island setting feels underutilized in supporting the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story struggles to evoke a strong emotional response or deeper meaning; while the ending aims for purpose, it feels forced, and the writing leans on telling rather than showing emotions and conflict.</comment>
