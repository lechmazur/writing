<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The soothsayer's pragmatic nature and humble demeanor are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to save the village feels generic and lacks personal depth or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the soothsayer's forging driving the story, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to earlier actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village setting is vividly described and enhances the eerie tone of dreadful hope; sensory details like creaking huts and whispers are effective, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a faint lingering thought of hope, though creative integration of elements feels forced at times.</comment>
