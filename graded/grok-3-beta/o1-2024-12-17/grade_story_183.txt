<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic language is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable mystical tropes without subversion; metaphors like "starlight enveloping" feel generic, lacking fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in combining elements, but cohesion suffers from underdeveloped character and rushed resolution; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
