<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to unify scattered minds is clear, but the "unlikely prophet" lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel generic and not uniquely tied to the rebellious attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and cause-effect links between transitions and actions are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The giant's study setting is evocative with sensory details like crackling firelight, but its connection to the action and character motivation feels underdeveloped; atmosphere only partially supports the tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with assigned elements, but they often seem forced rather than integral; style lacks clarity with overly ornate language, and depth beyond the narrative is minimal.</comment>
