<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Sylvia's loneliness and ringleader traits are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to guard the artifact is clear but lacks emotional depth or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is somewhat coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit. The action of outmaneuvering enemies is central but lacks logical grounding in the method's execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere of playful dread is moderately effective and complements the ghost story booth setting, but sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse. Setting and artifact connection is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks significant emotional impact or subtext; imagery like the flame dance is intriguing but feels gimmicky. Ending is somewhat satisfying but lacks depth or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by generic descriptors and predictable protector-of-artifact trope. Flame dance is a unique method but feels forced. Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated. Style lacks clarity and depth, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a choice.</comment>
