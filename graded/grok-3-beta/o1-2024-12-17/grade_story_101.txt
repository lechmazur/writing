<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the detour and return to the studio, but pacing feels uneven, and the connection between the parade detour and the broader narrative lacks depth and causality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with its elements, but the style often obscures clarity with overly ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
