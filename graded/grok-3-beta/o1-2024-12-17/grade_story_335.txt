<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to make peace with the past is clear, but the "shaky" and "carefully reckless" traits feel inconsistently applied, lacking depth in emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between rumor chains and the final discovery lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is vividly described and complements the tone of longing, but sensory details are uneven, and the atmosphere only partially supports the mercenaryâ€™s inner conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Some imagery (amber spider as symbol) adds depth, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfying, lacking a strong thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion; metaphors like the spider feel forced, and emotional resonance lacks nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
