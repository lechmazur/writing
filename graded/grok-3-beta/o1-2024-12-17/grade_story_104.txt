<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The stoic steward's personality is somewhat defined by stoicism, but his inner rebellion and longing feel underdeveloped and inconsistent with the stoic trait; motivation is clear but lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with shipping the cameo driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is intriguing and supports the atmosphere of secrecy, but sensory details are sparse, and the timeframe of harvest day feels underutilized in enhancing mood or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of rebellion and freedom, with some effective symbolism, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending lacks a strong, memorable punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of hidden rebellion is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable metaphors like "cracks in the facade," and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
