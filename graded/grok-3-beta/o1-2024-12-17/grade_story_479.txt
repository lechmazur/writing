<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maribel's glamorous undertaker persona is intriguing, but her motivation to preserve ancient practices feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her actions align with the brass measuring tape, yet her distinct voice is muted by repetitive emotional descriptors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the action of elongating colors feels symbolic but doesn't drive a clear narrative progression, and pacing feels uneven with overly detailed pigment mixing overshadowing resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is unique and ties to the concept of legacies, but sensory details are sparse beyond swirling colors; atmosphere supports the tone of jubilant remorse, though inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity with its subtext of hidden grandeur, but literary devices like the glowing tape feel forced; the ending lacks punch, and emotional impact relies on stated feelings rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a glamorous undertaker is original, the narrative leans on repetitive phrases like "jubilant remorse" and generic descriptors; emotional handling lacks subtlety, and the style feels overly ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
