<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand emotions is clear, but the quiet gardener's personality lacks depth beyond the assigned trait of quietness; reactions to the purse feel symbolic but not personal enough to reveal unique traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is vague, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on internal reflection over action or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the universal translation center is intriguing and complements the concept of emotional language, but sensory details are sparse, and bird calls feel more decorative than integral to atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of emotional translation is somewhat original, the execution feels formulaic with predictable reflections on silence and longing; metaphors like "stitching connections" are clich√©d and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style leans toward overwrought prose, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond surface themes of connection.</comment>
