<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels forced by abstract concepts; pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution and unclear cause-effect links between deconstruction and revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abandoned lighthouse setting is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, with strong sensory details like howling winds; however, connection to the sock feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity through symbolism of the sock and dreams, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on telling rather than showing; ending feels purposeful yet not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of weaving dreams is unique, the narrative leans on generic descriptors and predictable philosophical musings; metaphors like "tapestry of realization" feel overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but style often obscures clarity with ornate language; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a strength, lacking deeper resonance.</comment>
