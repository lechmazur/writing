<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the soft-voiced guide and traveler lack depth or distinct voices, with motivations (e.g., harnessing screams) feeling vague and unconvincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc and feels fragmented; the blackout and train detour donâ€™t cohesively drive the narrative, leaving pacing uneven and resolution forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative, and the style is overly ornate, hindering clarity and lasting impact.</comment>
