<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ferris’s portrayal as a small-time con artist is clear, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level desperation; the empty tape dispenser as a symbol is intriguing but underexplored in relation to his personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with Ferris’s shift toward redemption, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between his cons and ghostly interrogations lacks logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dystopian farm setting is vividly bleak with scorched fields and gray skies, enhancing the mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and tape dispenser feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through Ferris’s remorse, and the tape dispenser as a symbol of emptiness is effective, but the ending lacks punch, and the theme of redemption feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the ghostly apparitions offer a unique angle, the story leans on predictable redemption tropes without subversion, and emotional descriptions often state rather than show nuanced feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering impact or depth that would elevate it beyond a competent draft.</comment>
