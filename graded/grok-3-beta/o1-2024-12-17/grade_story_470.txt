<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rashem's practicality as a bard is somewhat evident in his problem-solving, but his motivation feels surface-level and lacks depth; his reactions and voice are not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive enough given the constraints, but the style is unremarkable and doesn't leave a lasting impression; creative integration of elements is present but not striking.</comment>
