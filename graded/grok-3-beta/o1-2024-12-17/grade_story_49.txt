<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the "lukewarm mage" lacks depth beyond vague descriptors like "loyally peculiar," and motivations feel stated rather than shown through actions or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; the looming "clash" lacks clear stakes or progression, and pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with too much focus on atmosphere over narrative arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from generic descriptors and overused metaphors like "dancing phantoms"; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative feels formulaic at times.</comment>
