<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation to revive the orchard is clear, but his "theoretically rebellious" nature feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between translating the orchard's language and the weathervane method feels forced and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a striking atmosphere, with evocative imagery, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the hermit's motivation feels somewhat superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through the hermit's persistence, and imagery like the comet's glow is effective, but the central conflict lacks sharpness, and the theme of renewal feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the execution relies on predictable tropes of nature's revival, and metaphors like "branches rattling like bones" are clich√©d; emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often feels overwrought, and the brief length exposes underdeveloped ideas rather than showcasing deliberate restraint.</comment>
