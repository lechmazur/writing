<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with the woodsman’s quest tied to personal loss, but the connection between his traits and actions feels underdeveloped; the artfully messy beard hints at depth but lacks impact on behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of short-circuiting illusions via echo measurement feels forced and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence; pacing is uneven with rushed emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is evocative and ties to the surreal tone, but sensory details are sparse; the setting supports the mood of despairing cheer, though its connection to the water tower and hospital beep feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of honesty, with some effective symbolism (hairbrush, echoes), but subtext is shallow; ending feels purposeful yet predictable, lacking a truly memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows some originality, metaphors like “shackles of guilt” are clichéd; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, and the narrative follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate, with only faint lingering impact.</comment>
