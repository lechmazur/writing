<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to coax thunder is intriguing but lacks depth in backstory; the dream thief's personality feels underdeveloped beyond fragmented self, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to past betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels rushed within the word limit; connection between sport and thunder is tenuous, and pacing suffers from abrupt shifts between memory and action, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the treehouse library is evocative and supports the tone of quiet mania, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere and connect setting to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through the theme of fragmentation, but literary devices like imagery are uneven; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a stronger central conflict or subtext for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining dream thief and thunder, but metaphors are occasionally generic; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and narrative follows a somewhat predictable redemption arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering thought or depth.</comment>
