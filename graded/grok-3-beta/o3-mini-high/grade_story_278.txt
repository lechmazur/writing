<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Cassian's brooding nature and motivation to escape servitude are stated but lack depth or nuanced exploration through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while the action of disappearing drives the narrative, the progression feels disjointed with unclear cause-effect links and rushed pacing within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The impact crater research base setting is evocative, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of murky tenderness feels forced rather than organically tied to the setting or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact; heavy reliance on ornate language overshadows subtext or deeper meaning, and the ending feels more poetic than satisfying or purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overuse of flowery prose and generic descriptors; metaphors like "dance of dust in a sunbeam" feel clich√©d, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story lacks cohesion; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative, and the style prioritizes embellishment over clarity, leaving little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
