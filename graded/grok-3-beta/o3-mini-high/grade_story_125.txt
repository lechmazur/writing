<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the misdelivered packages driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed and connections between elements are often vague or forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>While the concept of misdelivered packages is somewhat original, the narrative leans on predictable mage tropes and generic descriptors, lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style is overly ornate at times, and the short length feels like a constraint rather than a strength.</comment>
