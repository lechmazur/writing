<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; connections between rain patterns and ancestral unveiling are forced, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative imagery of the lighthouse library and rain, but sensory details are inconsistently specific, and the timeframe of "tailgating" feels disconnected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing shows ornate style but leans into purple prose with overused metaphors; lacks originality in emotional depiction and relies on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with thematic elements, but overly complex language hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks depth for lasting impact.</comment>
