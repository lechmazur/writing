<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to embody values is present but lacks depth; the "uniquely generic" attribute feels forced and underutilized in shaping personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; pacing is uneven within the word limit, and cause-effect links between protest and personal transformation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details of the haunted mansion graveyard, but the protest timeframe feels disconnected from the setting's mood and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Writing leans on purple prose and generic descriptors; metaphors lack freshness, and tone shifts unnaturally, suggesting formulaic construction over unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but style often obscures clarity; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking a lingering impact.</comment>
