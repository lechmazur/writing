<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing leans heavily on flowery language and generic metaphors, bordering on purple prose; lacks originality in emotional nuance and relies on predictable mystical tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but style often hinders clarity with overly complex phrasing; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
