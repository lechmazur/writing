<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the tired swordsman’s apathy and defiance are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice, making his inner struggle feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between meteor showers and overcoming personal demons is underdeveloped, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s potential to enhance the swordsman’s motivation is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional resonance through themes of redemption, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery is present but not striking, and the ending feels predictable rather than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in the setting, but leans on clichéd tropes of a haunted warrior seeking redemption; language is occasionally ornate with generic descriptors, lacking a truly unique voice or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
