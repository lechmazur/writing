<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Jonas's role as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer feels tacked on without depth in motivation or distinct voice, though the thawing heart concept shows slight emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc within the word limit; connections between beginning and end are vague, and pacing feels rushed with underdeveloped cause and effect, though the family tradition provides some coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival shooting gallery setting is evocative and supports the melancholic tone, with some sensory detail, but the connection to the timeframe and object feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of emotional resonance and symbolism with the amber, but lacks a strong central conflict or satisfying resolution; writing style is ornate but often tells rather than shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly flowery language and generic descriptors; metaphors like the amber feel predictable, and emotional handling lacks nuance, suggesting formulaic tendencies over unique insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style hinders clarity with excessive ornamentation, and while it leaves a lingering mood, depth beyond the surface is limited.</comment>
