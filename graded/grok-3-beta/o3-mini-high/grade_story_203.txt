<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elias's stage fright is mentioned but not meaningfully explored in actions or dialogue, lacking depth in motivation beyond vague resolve against inherited lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there’s a loose arc with the key and chamber, pacing feels rushed, and connections between actions and motivations are unclear or forced within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with cosmic debris and defiant hush, but sensory details are repetitive and lack specificity; setting supports tone but doesn’t deeply enhance character or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact; heavy reliance on abstract imagery over concrete conflict or subtext results in a forgettable narrative despite some symbolic effort with the key and lies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overwrought, purple prose and generic metaphors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, with predictable patterns and little unique voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style’s complexity obscures clarity without leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
