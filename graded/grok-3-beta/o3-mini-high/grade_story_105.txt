<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Edwin's motivation to prove midnight's transience is intriguing but underdeveloped; his outcast scholar identity lacks depth and distinct voice, with actions feeling more plot-driven than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed and incoherent at times, with the seashell's role and diary method not fully integrated into a logical cause-effect chain within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The witch's flying carpet garage and half-lit corridor create an evocative atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the seashell and action feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story attempts deeper meaning with midnight and soul-mirroring themes, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on repetitive, flowery phrases like "frantic peace" and generic imagery, lacking originality; metaphors feel overused, and emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story struggles with cohesion despite creative elements; style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
