<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Cassian's "careless" and "deliberately dreamy" traits are mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or distinct voice, and his motivation to emancipate memories feels abstract and ungrounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc; while the action of investigating doodles drives some progression, the story feels fragmented and incomplete, with pacing that meanders rather than builds tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The enchanted oak grove setting is vividly described with sensory details like raindrops and thunder, enhancing the atmosphere, but its connection to the characterâ€™s motivation and the worn-out glove feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional impact or clear conflict; while imagery and symbolism are present, they feel overwrought, and the ending lacks satisfaction or deeper meaning beyond vague promises of hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from purple prose and repetitive phrasing like "borrowed memories," suggesting formulaic writing; metaphors are often generic, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style prioritizes ornate language over clarity, leaving little lingering impact or depth.</comment>
