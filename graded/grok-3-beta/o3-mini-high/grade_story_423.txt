<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; Sir Alaric's earnestness is stated but not vividly shown through actions or internal conflict, and his connection to the astronomical map feels superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; the action of mapping tears is intriguing but poorly integrated, and pacing is uneven with rushed resolutions within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive, flowery language and generic metaphors like "canvas of life"; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite creative elements; the story feels forced around assigned elements rather than organically driven, and the style often obscures clarity with ornate prose.</comment>
