<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Elias's sincerity and rebel nature are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to preserve building traditions feels vague and disconnected from personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc; the story meanders through abstract musings without a strong resolution. Pacing feels uneven, with too much focus on atmosphere over progression within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative descriptions of the haunted passage and storms creating a vivid mood. However, sensory details are sometimes repetitive, and the setting overshadows character and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through imagery and theme of confronting fear, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing emotions. The ending feels more poetic than purposeful, lacking a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overuse of gothic clich√©s and flowery language that borders on purple prose. Emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced, and the narrative lacks a fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic. Style is overly ornate, hindering clarity, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
