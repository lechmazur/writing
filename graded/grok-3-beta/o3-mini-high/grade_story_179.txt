<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; while there’s a semblance of an arc, the action of mobilizing feels vague, and the story lacks clear cause-and-effect progression within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The beehive setting is vividly described with sensory detail, creating a strong atmosphere, but its connection to the character’s motivation and actions remains tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of evocative imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by overwrought language and a lack of clear conflict or tension; the ending feels more poetic than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly ornate prose and generic emotional descriptors; metaphors feel forced, and the narrative lacks a distinct voice or fresh perspective, leaning on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than integral, and the style prioritizes florid language over clarity, leaving little lasting impact.</comment>
