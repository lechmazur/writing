<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Martin's motivation to overcome personal tragedy is mentioned but lacks depth or specificity, making it feel generic; his vigilant nature as an orchardist is underutilized in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between unraveling conspiracies and paper airplanes feels forced; pacing is uneven with rushed revelations and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is intriguing but lacks vivid sensory detail to ground the atmosphere; the tone of sardonic glee clashes inconsistently with the setting's high-security seriousness.</comment>
