<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Rolf's cautious smuggler persona and motivation to master empathy feel stated rather than shown through actions or nuanced reactions, lacking a distinct voice or depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; while the action of predicting drives the narrative, the story lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit, with pacing feeling rushed and connections between elements forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drought prediction center setting is evocative and ties to the theme of drought, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the characterâ€™s motivation and story concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is limited; while some imagery and symbolism are present, the emotional resonance is weak, the ending feels unresolved, and the central conflict lacks clarity or tension within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly ornate language and purple prose, with generic descriptors and stated emotions rather than nuanced showing; the narrative feels formulaic and lacks a fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is poor; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style hinders clarity with overly complex phrasing, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
