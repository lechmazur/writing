<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Arjun's transition from city planner to doomsday prepper is intriguing, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; they feel more symbolic than personal, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of debasing archaic protocols feels vague and disconnected from a concrete resolution, resulting in uneven pacing and coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient Indian temple setting is evocative and complements the tone of daring caution, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Arjun's motivations or the core concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on overly ornate language and generic metaphors (e.g., "broken stars"), with a lack of nuanced emotion or fresh perspective, suggesting formulaic tendencies over authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style often hinders clarity with excessive abstraction; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
