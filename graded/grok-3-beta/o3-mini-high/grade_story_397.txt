<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand the past is present but lacks depth; Elias feels more like a vessel for the concept than a fully realized person with a distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while thereâ€™s a vague arc, the connection between beginning and end feels forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed introspection over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory setting is evocative and ties to the atmosphere of experimentation, but sensory details are sparse, and the tone of optimistic desperation feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Storytelling lacks emotional resonance; heavy reliance on telling over showing, with symbolism (e.g., scalpel, doodles) feeling overwrought and lacking subtlety or impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly ornate language and generic metaphors; emotional portrayal is stated rather than shown, and the narrative feels formulaic despite unique elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak; assigned elements feel forced into the narrative rather than organically integrated, and the style often obscures clarity with excessive flourish.</comment>
