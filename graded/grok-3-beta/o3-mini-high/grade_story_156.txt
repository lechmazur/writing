<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the confused diplomat's resolve feels inconsistent with the "boldly timid" attribute, and reactions to the spare computer key are symbolic but not revealing of personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; while there is a vague arc, the action of liberalizing feels forced within the word limit, and pacing is uneven with abrupt shifts that disrupt coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite creative elements; the story feels built around assigned elements rather than using them organically, and the style often obscures clarity with ornate phrasing.</comment>
