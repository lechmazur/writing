<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Eli's "rash protector" trait feels mentioned rather than embodied, with little insight into how it drives actions or evolves through the story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution; while the fortress and postcards provide direction, the narrative meanders without a strong causal link or satisfying conclusion within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and mystical tone create a vivid atmosphere, with sensory details like howling caverns enhancing mood, though the setting occasionally overshadows character and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of evocative imagery and subtext with the postcards, but emotional impact is diluted by overwritten prose and a lack of focused conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly ornate language and generic mystical tropes; metaphors feel forced, and emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced together, and the style prioritizes florid description over clarity, leaving little lasting impact or depth.</comment>
