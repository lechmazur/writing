<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jazz age time capsule setting is evocative with sensory details like jazz strains, but the connection to knitting and other elements feels forced; atmosphere supports the tone of numb fascination but lacks deeper integration with character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story has some thematic depth with its focus on breaking expectations, but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing; imagery and symbolism are present but often overwrought, diminishing emotional impact.</comment>
