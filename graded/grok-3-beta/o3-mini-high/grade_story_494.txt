<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the arrogant swordsman’s doubtfully confident nature is stated but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the tapestry fragment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc within the word limit; while there’s a sense of journey, the resolution feels vague, and pacing is bogged down by overwrought descriptions rather than forward momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn’t fully amplify the swordsman’s internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic imagery like the tapestry, but it leans heavily on telling over showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch despite thematic depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Originality suffers from overly ornate language and generic metaphors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown, and the narrative follows a predictable introspective warrior trope without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive in tone but not in narrative clarity; the style hinders accessibility with excessive flourish, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
