<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; the action of warning drives the story, yet pacing is uneven, and connections between events are often vague within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underwater city laboratory setting is evocative and supports the tone of decay, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere occasionally feels overwrought rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of poetic imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive telling over showing; the ending lacks a satisfying resolution, feeling more like a pause than a conclusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the style prioritizes flourish over clarity, leaving little lasting impact or depth.</comment>
