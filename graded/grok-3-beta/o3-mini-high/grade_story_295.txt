<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Darien’s jovial nature and reluctance are mentioned but not deeply explored; motivation to dethrone doubt feels vague and lacks specificity in driving actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc but feels fragmented; the action of treasuring relics drives the story minimally, and pacing is uneven with overly dense descriptions crowding the short length.</comment>
