<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of exploring feels loosely connected to the core concept of taken chances, and pacing is uneven with rushed transitions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by repetitive phrases like "peaceful anger" and generic descriptors; the narrative lacks fresh metaphors and shows signs of formulaic structure with little subversion of tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is weak despite incorporating assigned elements; the style is overly ornate at times, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
