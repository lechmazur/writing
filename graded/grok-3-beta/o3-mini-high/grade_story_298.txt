<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liang's "rationally impulsive" nature is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; his motivations are clear but lack depth, and his reactions to the doll's dress feel more symbolic than personal, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "reproducing" legends feels vague and disconnected from solving mysteries; pacing is uneven, with rushed revelations disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace reimagined in a futuristic context is evocative, and sunlight through debris enhances the mood, but sensory details are repetitive and the atmosphere only partially supports Liang's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through imagery, but literary devices like the doll's dress symbolism feel heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a strong central conflict or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of forgotten pasts and relies on overly ornate language; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced human depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style often hinders clarity with excessive flourish; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, though it leaves a faint lingering thought.</comment>
