<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's portrayal as an apologetic thug shows potential, with remorse driving his actions, but his motivation lacks depth and specificity; the "rationally subjective" attribute feels forced and underexplored in shaping his personality or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of "outlasting" the past driving the narrative, but the method of staging museum encounters feels contrived and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence and pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is evocative and complements the quietly intense tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between the setting and the wooden crate slat feels superficial, limiting atmospheric immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts emotional resonance through Marcus's journey, with some effective symbolism (crate slat as past), but it often tells rather than shows emotions, and the ending feels more repetitive than satisfying, lacking sharp impact or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of breaking free from the past offers some originality, the writing leans on flowery, repetitive phrases ("silent rebellion," "quiet repository") and generic descriptors, suggesting formulaic tendencies over unique voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but the style often hinders clarity with overwrought language; it leaves a lingering thought of transformation, yet feels constrained rather than deliberately concise.</comment>
