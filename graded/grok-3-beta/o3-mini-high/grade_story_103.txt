<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to hush regret is clear, but Sir Alaric lacks depth beyond generic knightly resolve; his personality feels archetypal, with no distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the brass door knocker.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete within the word limit; pacing is uneven, with overemphasis on introspection disrupting momentum, and cause-effect links between actions and outcomes are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse prison is evocative with strong sensory details like mist and crashing waves, enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of "mirrored reflection" feels forced and underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of regret and hope, with decent imagery, but lacks subtext or a truly memorable perspective; ending feels predictable, and conflict resolution is underwhelming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on flowery, repetitive phrases like "joyful agony," suggesting formulaic tendencies; metaphors are often generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, relying on stated feelings over shown reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but style is overly ornate, hindering clarity; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and lingering impact is minimal due to shallow depth.</comment>
