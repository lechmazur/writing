<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lirian's motivation to master reality is clear but lacks depth; their immortality and scholarly nature feel stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with digitizing journals as a driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and resolution is tenuous within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underground city and post-star timeframe create a compelling, cohesive atmosphere with vivid sensory details like bioluminescence, enhancing the tone of detached devotion and the burden of light.</comment>
