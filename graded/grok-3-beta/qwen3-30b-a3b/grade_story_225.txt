<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with the apothecary's past as a healer and their connection to the butterflies, but their personality lacks depth and a distinct voice; the "unjustly fair" trait feels underexplored and inconsistently tied to actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the butterfly tracking leading to a virus discovery and a moral choice, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between elements like Morse code and the virus feels forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The steampunk submarine setting is vivid and enhances the battered marvel tone with sensory details like creaking gears, effectively supporting the atmosphere, though the timeframe of broken treaties lacks specificity to deepen the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with the apothecary's sacrifice, and the butterflies as carriers provide some subtext, but the ending feels predictable, and the writing leans on telling over showing, diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the steampunk and virus elements offer some originality, the narrative relies on familiar tropes of misunderstood healers and self-sacrifice without subversion; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, often stating rather than showing feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but the style lacks polish, and the lingering impact is muted by a predictable resolution and shallow thematic depth.</comment>
