<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias’s social awkwardness as an inventor is implied but not deeply explored; his motivation to overcome regret feels somewhat vague and lacks specificity in action alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the decoding action driving progression, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between regret and the archive’s resolution is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The diner setting during the late shift enhances the restless tone effectively, with some evocative sensory details, but the connection between the whistle and setting feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable regret motifs without subversion, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown; writing style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
