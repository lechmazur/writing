<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira’s headstrong nature is evident, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; the shift to vulnerability lacks deeper grounding in her established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between confession and orchard revival isn’t fully logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the tone’s merry bitterness occasionally clashes with the bleakness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Lira’s confession, and imagery like “glitter scattering like stardust” is striking, but the theme of courage feels surface-level, lacking deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept are original, some metaphors (e.g., “wounded beast”) feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stating feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
