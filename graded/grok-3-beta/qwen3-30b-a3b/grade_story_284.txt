<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Rourke's stoicism and earnestness are portrayed with some depth, especially in his interaction with the paper plane and the beekeeper, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking a stronger personal stakes or backstory to anchor his emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with returning the wallet driving the narrative forward, but pacing feels uneven—some emotional beats are rushed, and the resolution lacks a stronger causal link to the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The beekeeper’s sanctuary is vividly rendered with sensory details like the hum of hives and scent of honey, enhancing the mood and supporting the emotional tone, though the corner bar setting feels underutilized in contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through Rourke’s unguarded moments and the paper plane’s symbolism, but dialogue occasionally feels stilted, and the central conflict remains understated, missing a sharper tension within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in combining a pirate radio operator with a beekeeper’s sanctuary, it leans on familiar emotional tropes of stoicism melting into vulnerability without fully subverting them, and some metaphors like “fortress of salt and steel” feel slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a deliberate brevity, and the elements are generally in service of the narrative, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly obscuring clarity, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
