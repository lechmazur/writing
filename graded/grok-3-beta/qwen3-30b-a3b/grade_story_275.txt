<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hermit's mysterious nature and rebellious attribute are present, but his motivation lacks depth beyond a vague sense of purpose tied to the album; his actions are consistent but not revelatory, and his voice is indistinct due to the third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc with the orchard's transformation, but the connection between the comet, weathervane, and album feels tenuous; pacing is managed within the word limit, though some transitions are abrupt and coherence suffers slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a striking atmosphere, with evocative imagery and sensory details enhancing the mood; however, the setting's connection to the pressed flower album feels somewhat forced and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through themes of persistence and renewal, with strong use of symbolism (comet, album); yet, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the lack of dialogue limits character depth, though imagery adds impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers an original premise with the comet and orchard, some metaphors (e.g., "language of survival") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but stated rather than shown at times, and the tone remains consistent but not uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the weathervane and comet, leaving a lingering thought about resilience; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
