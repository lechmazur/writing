<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to loss and the sea glass is clear, but the lone trapper's personality lacks depth or distinct voice; actions feel driven by plot necessity rather than intrinsic traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between decoding microfilm and the final burst of light are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the floating observatory enhances the gritty, isolated tone and complements the concept of loss; sensory details like creaking and humming are evocative, though smell and taste are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (sea glass, black hole of doubt) are strong, creating subtext about renewal, but emotional resonance is undermined by overt telling of feelings rather than showing through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others (dying star, cracks of time) feel overused; tone is consistent, yet emotional depth lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings rather than subtle cues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity over depth.</comment>
