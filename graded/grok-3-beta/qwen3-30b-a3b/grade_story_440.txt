<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The detached swordsman’s personality is hinted at through subtle actions like the tender pocketing of the sea pottery, but his motivation to consecrate an impossible vow feels vague and underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper insight into his internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically from discovery to revelation via reassembling scraps, achieving a clear arc within the tight word count; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the vow and the secret weavers is underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center is vividly realized with sensory details like crunching glass and humming sorters, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and renewal; yet, the setting’s integration with the swordsman’s motivation feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of mending brokenness, with effective symbolism in the mirror and sea pottery, but the ending lacks a deeper punch, and the central conflict of the vow remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the narrative shows some originality in combining futuristic decay with ancient vows, it leans on predictable tropes of hidden artifacts and secret messages without fully subverting them; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creatively integrated elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of possibility; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
