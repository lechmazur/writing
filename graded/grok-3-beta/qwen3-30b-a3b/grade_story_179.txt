<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the watchman’s confidence and forcibly gentle nature are intriguing but underexplored. Motivation to hush envy feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the action to mobilize is vague and doesn’t drive a satisfying resolution. Pacing feels meandering with insufficient cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting of the giant beehive is vivid with strong sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere. However, the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous, missing deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact through symbolism (cracked ruler, hive), but emotional resonance is inconsistent. Subtext is present but not fully developed; ending lacks a powerful punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by overused metaphors (fracture as inner conflict) and occasionally ornate language. Emotional handling feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is moderate; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced. Style is evocative but not always clear, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
