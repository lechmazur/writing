<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The unseen observer's motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, and the attribute of "aggressively kind" somewhat shapes its relentless push, but the character's personality lacks depth or distinct voice, making its actions feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a clear arc within the word limit, and the action of flinging the whistle drives the narrative forward, but pacing feels rushed at times, and cause-effect relationships between the whale’s call and the lighthouse’s awakening are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse watch room setting and the timeframe of the dancer’s first step work well together, with evocative sensory details like the whale’s call and groaning gears enhancing the atmosphere, though the connection between the setting and the whistle feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood with strong imagery and symbolism, and the ending feels purposeful, but it leans heavily on telling over showing, with limited emotional resonance or subtext beyond the surface theme of preserving tradition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors like “breath of wind through broken glass” feel overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced, giving a slightly formulaic tone despite creative intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with a lingering thematic question, and the brief length seems deliberate, but the integration of assigned elements occasionally overshadows narrative clarity, and the style leans toward ornate over purposeful.</comment>
