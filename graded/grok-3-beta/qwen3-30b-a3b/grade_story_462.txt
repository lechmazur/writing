<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed and the connection between action and concept is abstract rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes introspection through symbolism of mirrors and sparks, with a satisfying ending; however, subtext is occasionally heavy-handed, and tension feels understated for the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering introspective tone; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
