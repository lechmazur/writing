<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find liberation in letting go is clear and aligns with her interactions with ghosts, but her personality as an elevator repair technician feels underexplored, lacking a distinct voice or deeper connection to her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, but the pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between the ghosts and the sand castles are intriguing yet underdeveloped, leading to minor coherence issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab setting is vividly realized with sensory details like grains of memory and the scent of petrichor, enhancing the eerie atmosphere, though the timeframe of lunch breaks feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through themes of grief and release, with effective symbolism in the flower crown, but the lack of dialogue and occasional over-telling of emotions slightly diminishes impact and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of elements, some metaphors (e.g., "grains of memory") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings rather than shown complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of release, but the style sometimes prioritizes poetic flourish over clarity, and the brief length occasionally feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
