<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The shaky mercenary's characterization is somewhat developed through his trembling hands and past regrets, but his motivation feels vague and lacks depth; the "carefully reckless" attribute is mentioned but not vividly shown in action or decision-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a clear beginning and resolution within the word limit, driven by the search for the amber, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between rumor chains and the final discovery lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral setting is evocatively described with strong sensory details like skeletal arches and graffiti, enhancing the atmosphere of decay and longing; the timeframe of the "slow fade of an echoing hour" adds a poetic layer, though its impact on action is minimal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective emotional response through the mercenary's journey and the amber's symbolism, with effective imagery, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of confronting the past lacks a deeper, surprising subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some individual style in its melancholic tone, metaphors like the spider's stillness feel somewhat generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown through subtle actions or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements woven in purposefully, and the brief length feels intentional, but the style occasionally leans on overly poetic phrasing, slightly obscuring clarity; it leaves a lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
