<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaito’s arrogance and doubtful confidence are well-portrayed, shaping his initial actions and dialogue, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt and lacks deeper internal conflict to fully justify the shift in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at the turning point, and the connection between the action (authorizing a duel) and the method (a song) is underdeveloped, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard is vividly described with sensory details like the smell of ink and rain, enhancing the atmosphere of harsh tenderness, though the timeframe "between breaths" feels underutilized and disconnected from the setting’s impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Kaito’s transformation and uses effective symbolism with the tapestry, but the dialogue feels slightly forced, and the theme of creation over destruction, while present, lacks deeper subtext or complexity for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique take on a swordsman’s journey, some metaphors (e.g., “spark that refused to die”) feel generic, and the emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a strength, and the lingering impact is present but not profound due to underdeveloped depth in theme and character.</comment>
