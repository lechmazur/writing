<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to break the cycle of lies is clear, but the exorcist's personality and stage fright feel underexplored; reactions to objects and concepts lack depth in shaping distinct voice or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is somewhat coherent with a beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed; connections between actions and concepts are vague, disrupting logical flow within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like “funeral shroud” feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than nuanced, and tone shifts slightly disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element use, but style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate language; brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking deeper lingering impact.</comment>
