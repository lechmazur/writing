<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The midwife’s critical nature and secretive attribute are present but underexplored; her motivation to recover stolen memories feels somewhat vague, lacking deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between transcending and the diaries is not fully logical or impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orchard island in a maelstrom is vividly depicted with strong sensory detail, enhancing the dissonant calm tone, though the setting’s connection to the midwife’s motivation feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection through imagery and subtext about loss and memory, but the emotional impact is diluted by occasional overwriting and a resolution that feels more poetic than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the imagery is often fresh, the story leans on familiar tropes of hidden diaries and mysterious islands without significant subversion; emotional nuance is present but sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks a sharp, memorable takeaway.</comment>
