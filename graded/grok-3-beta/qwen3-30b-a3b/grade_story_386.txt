<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to bind old wounds is clear but lacks depth; the "trustworthy strange" attribute feels underexplored and doesn't distinctly shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the catapult's role as a plot driver is somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, with vivid imagery like "borrowed dawn," though sensory details beyond sight are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the tablecloth and lighthouse, evoking thought, but emotional resonance is limited by overly stated feelings rather than shown nuance; ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like time fractures and star-aligned catapults, but metaphors like "borrowed dawn" verge on clich√©, and emotional depth lacks human nuance, feeling slightly formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks deeper questioning.</comment>
