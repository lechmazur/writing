<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The scribe’s uptight nature and uncertainty are evident, but their motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" feels abstract and underdeveloped, lacking concrete grounding in action or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a clear arc within the word limit, but the connection between the adhesive analysis and the bulb’s revelation feels slightly forced; pacing is managed but not seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The witch’s greenhouse and gravestones create a vivid, eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details like fogged glass and damp soil, effectively enhancing the tone of buried optimism and the scribe’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the scribe’s shift to empathy, with strong symbolism in the bulb and gravestones, but the ending feels slightly overwrought, and the central theme of transformation lacks sharper conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality with the bulb as a key to the dead’s voices, metaphors like “blooming heart” feel clichéd, and emotional resonance relies too much on explicit statements over nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the bulb and greenhouse, leaving a lingering sense of hope, but overly ornate language occasionally hinders clarity and emotional depth.</comment>
