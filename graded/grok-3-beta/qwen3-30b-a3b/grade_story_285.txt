<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Kael’s hesitance and awkwardness are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to restore systems feels vague and lacks emotional depth, failing to fully shape his actions or reveal a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of emerging tied to bridging worlds, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between crabs and translocation lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and complements the eerie tone, enhancing the atmosphere; however, sensory details are uneven, and the setting’s connection to the postcard feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional resonance with Kael’s internal conflict, and the postcard as a symbol of potential is intriguing, but the ending lacks impact, and much of the narrative relies on telling rather than showing, diminishing craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of crabs as a method for translocation is original, the execution feels forced and inconsistent; metaphors like “whispered secret” are generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, bordering on predictable patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves some cohesion with creative use of elements like the postcard and crabs, but the style occasionally obscures clarity with overwritten phrases, and the brevity feels more like a limitation than a choice, lacking lingering depth.</comment>
