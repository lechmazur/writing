<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a loose arc with the riddle and weaving driving progression, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with an overly abrupt resolution that lacks grounding in prior buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sailor’s graveyard and timeframe of between seasons create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by evocative sensory details like salt-slick soil and fog; setting strongly supports the tone of dignified chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (yarn as cosmos) and subtext about life’s patterns, but emotional resonance is muted by telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a visceral punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but overwrought style occasionally obscures clarity; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
