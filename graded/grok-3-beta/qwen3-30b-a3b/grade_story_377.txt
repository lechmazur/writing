<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret society library setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of drowsy enthusiasm, with sensory details like aged paper enhancing mood, but the block party timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the atmosphere below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kael's silent courage, with some effective imagery like the barometer’s pulses, but the central conflict feels vague, and the ending lacks a truly satisfying resolution or deeper subtext.</comment>
