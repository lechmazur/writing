<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing but incomplete; the "social media exorcist" has a unique premise, but her motivations remain vague and inconsistently tied to her actions, lacking depth in personal stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure shows potential with a discernible arc, but coherence suffers from abrupt shifts and unclear cause-effect links; pacing feels rushed, especially in the ritual's resolution, undermining narrative impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with vivid sensory details like "mildew and forgotten dreams," enhancing mood; however, the setting's connection to character motivation and action feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with evocative imagery and subtext, but the emotional resonance is uneven; dialogue feels forced, and the central conflict lacks sharp focus within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors ("ghost of a life") and a predictable ritual motif; while the concept is unique, execution lacks nuance in emotion and relies on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative intent but lacks polish for top-tier publication; cohesion is strained by forced elements, and depth is suggested but not fully realized, leaving the impact muted.</comment>
