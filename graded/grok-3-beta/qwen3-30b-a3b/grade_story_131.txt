<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s aloofness and orphan status are evident, but her motivation to transform fear into courage feels underexplored and somewhat generic; her actions align, yet lack depth in revealing nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but feels rushed within the word limit; the action of loosening is symbolically tied to the message, but cause-effect links are vague, and pacing struggles with abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is intriguing and enhances the mood with sensory details like static hums, but its connection to the stones and character motivation feels underdeveloped; atmosphere supports but doesn’t fully immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild emotional response through symbolism of stones and anomaly, but subtext is shallow; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution feels more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of the anomaly offers some originality, the narrative leans on predictable themes of loss and resilience without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often safe, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brevity feels like a limitation, and while there’s a lingering thought, overall impact remains moderate.</comment>
