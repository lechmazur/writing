<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the guard’s “loyally disloyal” trait feels intriguing but lacks depth in motivation or backstory to justify their actions or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed; while there’s a poetic arc, the connection between beginning and end feels forced, and pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story has creative ambition but lacks cohesion; assigned elements feel stitched together rather than organically integrated, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
