<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The weatherbeaten knight's portrayal carries some depth through his burdened past and regret, but his motivations remain vague and underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reactions to fully ground his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the concept of impossible choices drives the narrative, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional shifts and some logical gaps in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the mood of isolation and regret, though the connection between setting and specific objects like the doll feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through themes of regret and forgiveness, with decent use of symbolism (mirror, serpent), but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch and relies on telling over showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some originality in its surreal elements, it leans on familiar tropes of haunted pasts and redemption without subversion, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than deeply shown through nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, but the style occasionally veers into ornate language that obscures clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering impact.</comment>
