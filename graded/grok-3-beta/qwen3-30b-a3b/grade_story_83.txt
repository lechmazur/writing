<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover truth and sow a better tomorrow is clear, but her suspiciously trusting nature feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the candle wick tracing method driving the story forward, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth of broken mirrors is vividly described and enhances the eerie atmosphere, supporting the tone and concept, though sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has subtext with the mirror motif and fateful encounter, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; dialogue feels purposeful but not entirely natural, and the ending lacks a strong punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the mirror imagery offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar mysterious-lab tropes without subversion; metaphors like "trapped souls" feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of self-confrontation, though not powerfully executed.</comment>
