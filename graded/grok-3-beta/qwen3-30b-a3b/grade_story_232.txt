<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias’s drive to decode inscriptions tied to past regrets, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; reactions to the cutlass are evocative yet repetitive, missing a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with urgency driving toward the temple, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connections between beginning and end are present but not seamless, with some logical gaps in action coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with the digital nomad camp and jungle, enhancing mood through sensory details like waves and rain; tone aligns with dire enchantment, though setting-object connection feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue through imagery and symbolism of the cutlass, but emotional impact is shallow; ending is purposeful yet lacks resonance; central conflict is present but underdeveloped within word constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, with lingering impact minimal.</comment>
