<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dutiful scholar's motivation to uncover a forbidden tale is clear, but their personality feels underdeveloped beyond the "uncommonly typical" trait, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the wire coil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of contaminating driving tension, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links between the well’s echo and temporal disruption are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The capsule hotel for time travelers is vividly imagined, enhancing the atmosphere of temporal fragility, though sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the well feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (time as a mirror) and subtext about remembrance adds depth, but emotional resonance is uneven, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a time-travel hotel is intriguing, some imagery (e.g., "yawned like a wound") feels overused, and emotional portrayal occasionally leans on telling rather than showing, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the wire coil, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
