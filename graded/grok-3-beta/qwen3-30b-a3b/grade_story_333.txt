<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve traditions is clear, but the "sincere rebel" lacks depth beyond defiance; reactions and dialogue feel somewhat predictable, missing a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the stranger’s reveal lacks sufficient buildup for coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with sensory details like damp stone and storm-soaked fabric, enhancing the haunted setting; tone of bitterness aligns well with the concept, though setting’s connection to motivation feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery and subtext about confronting fear, but dialogue feels occasionally stilted; ending is satisfying yet lacks profound impact; central theme of tradition vs. fear is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like “torn notes fluttering like wounded birds” are fresh, some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown; narrative avoids major clichés but lacks a truly unique perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; length feels deliberate, yet lacks a lingering depth or unforgettable impression.</comment>
