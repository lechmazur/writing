<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a logical progression from blackout to restoration, but pacing feels uneven—key moments like the needle’s significance are rushed, undermining coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel slotted in rather than organic; it leaves a lingering thought of hope, though depth is limited by surface-level execution.</comment>
