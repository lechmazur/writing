<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The exiled prince's motivation to cure loneliness is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond a generic sense of loss. His interaction with the mortar and pestle hints at inner conflict, yet his actions feel more reactive than driven by a distinct character voice or nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the snowstorm driving the action logically into the customs office. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end, while present, lacks a stronger resolution to tie the journey together.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned customs office and snowstorm create a chilling, isolating atmosphere that complements the theme of loneliness. Sensory details like creaking wood and frosted windows are evocative, though some descriptions could be more unique to avoid familiarity in tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response through the prince's loneliness, and imagery like the “dying beast” building is effective. However, the ending feels more suggestive than satisfying, and the central conflict remains underdeveloped, lacking sharper tension or resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on familiar tropes of exile and mysterious artifacts without significant subversion. Metaphors are somewhat generic (“weight of the past”), and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown through nuanced subtext, diminishing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the lingering impact is muted by an unclear resolution, leaving depth underdeveloped despite creative potential.</comment>
