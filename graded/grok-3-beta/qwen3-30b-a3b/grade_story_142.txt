<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evangeline's motivation to reclaim her family's legacy through secret recipes is clear, and her broke aristocrat status shapes her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the burdened noble archetype. Her voice isn't distinct, and reactions to the illustration feel predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with legacy's burden driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed at the climax with the roller coaster. Cause and effect are logical, though the ghostly voice feels like a forced resolution mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting enhances the eerie tone and complements legacy's burden effectively. Sensory details like rust and burnt sugar immerse the reader, though the connection between the botanical illustration and setting feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Evangeline's struggle, with strong imagery and symbolism (legacy as chain/compass), but the dialogue is unnatural and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a truly satisfying punch. Subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like "serpent’s spine" feel overused, and sensory details occasionally lean generic. The tone is consistent, but emotional resonance is stated more than shown, missing nuanced human depth. Originality is moderate but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the amusement park, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity. It leaves a lingering thought about legacy, though the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
