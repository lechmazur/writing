<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed; connections between actions and labyrinth shifts are intriguing yet not fully logical or cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked through sensory details like humming resonance and the giant’s bookshelf; setting enhances mood, though timeframe integration is subtle and underdeveloped.</comment>
