<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with coincidences driving the investigation logically, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between beginning and end is present but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting of watchtowers and tar pit is vividly described with evocative sensory details like sulfur and trembling earth, enhancing the atmosphere of desperate hope; however, the suburban home feels underutilized in contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Elara’s legacy, with effective imagery like the butterfly and black glass bridge; yet, the central conflict lacks sharp tension, and the theme of kinship feels stated rather than deeply explored.</comment>
