<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chameleon stage actor’s portrayal is intriguing, with the rationally impulsive trait driving his actions, but his motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking depth in emotional nuance beyond the desire to weave honesty into illusions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the act of reproducing the past driving the story, but pacing feels uneven—some moments rush while others linger unnecessarily, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace setting and post-oil timeframe are evocatively described with strong sensory details like “dust-choked” and “oil and decay,” enhancing the atmosphere of anxious serenity, though the connection to the doll’s dress feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its focus on memory and loss, with effective imagery like “sunlight through debris,” but the ending lacks a truly satisfying punch, and the conflict resolution feels more symbolic than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a chameleon actor is unique, some metaphors like “ghostly fingers” feel overused, and emotional descriptions occasionally lean on stating rather than showing, reducing authenticity; overall, the style shows individuality but not consistently.</comment>
