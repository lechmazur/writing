<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Jax’s spirited nature and motivation to learn healing traditions are clear, but his gracefully awkward attribute feels inconsistently applied and does not deeply shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between nightmares and the coded letter’s resolution lacks clear cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant setting is evocative with sensory details like rosemary and decay, effectively supporting the tone of harsh tenderness, but the integration of bike rides with the atmosphere feels underdeveloped.</comment>
