<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows promise with the pickpocketâ€™s internal conflict and transformation, but motivation feels underdeveloped and reactions to the dummy lack deeper nuance; the voice is distinct but not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional shifts; cause and effect are logical, yet the transformation concept drives the plot somewhat predictably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone, though the timeframe feels underexplored in relation to the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes reflection through the transformation theme and employs strong imagery, but dialogue feels slightly forced; the ending is purposeful, though emotional resonance could be deeper with more showing over telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by reliance on gothic tropes without full subversion; metaphors are often fresh, but some emotional descriptions lack nuance, and the narrative occasionally borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering question, though the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
