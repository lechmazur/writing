<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; the hive-mind therapist’s motivation to anchor the ephemeral is stated but not explored through actions or inner conflict, resulting in a shallow portrayal despite a unique premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete; while the action of draining wax ties to a symbolic purpose, the narrative lacks a clear resolution or progression, leaving the story feeling more like a vignette than a cohesive tale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like beeswax scent and wax drips, effectively creating a peculiar tone, but the secret agent training facility feels underutilized and disconnected from the therapist’s actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of evocative imagery and subtext with wax as memory, but the emotional impact is muted by lack of character grounding and an ambiguous ending that feels more confusing than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is present in the hive-mind concept and symbolic wax, but the writing leans on repetitive phrases like “sound of hindsight” and generic emotional descriptors, diminishing authenticity and freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative intent with integrated elements, but lacks cohesion and depth; it feels more like an experimental sketch than a polished piece, missing the clarity and impact needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
