<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but lacks depth; the astronomer’s awe and rational approach are noted but not fully explored through distinct actions or voice, leaving their personality somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence with a discernible arc, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the connection between snowflake patterns and the resolution is intriguing but not entirely logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with the lighthouse orchard and ice floes vividly rendered through sensory details; the tone of desolation enhances the moral dilemma, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes reflection on choice and human spirit via strong symbolism (veil, idol); however, the ending feels slightly abrupt, and emotional depth relies more on description than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique imagery and setting, but some metaphors (snowflake symmetry, veil’s weight) verge on cliché; emotional resonance is stated more than felt, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of themes; yet, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
