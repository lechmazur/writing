<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the unraveling of the net as a central action, but the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous, and pacing is uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a pyramid is evocatively described with sensory details like dust motes and whispers, enhancing atmosphere, but the settingâ€™s connection to garage sales and overall tone feels forced.</comment>
