<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to solve the labyrinth is clear, but the "philosopher-king" title feels underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes his actions beyond a symbolic burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; while the labyrinth-as-mirror concept emerges, the pacing is uneven, with rushed resolutions and unclear cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details of the sandstone labyrinth and lanterns, but the setting's connection to character motivation feels tenuous and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (labyrinth as mirror) and a thought-provoking ending, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Original imagery and concept are present, but reliance on abstract metaphors borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance lacks specificity and depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent in combining elements, but cohesion suffers from overambition within the length, leaving lingering questions without sufficient clarity or impact.</comment>
