<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map abandoned railways is clear and tied to personal loss, but his personality lacks depth beyond quiet precision, and his interaction with the hairbrush feels contrived rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the short-circuit action feels forced as a plot device, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional beats at the end disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is evocative with strong sensory detail like electromagnetic whispers, enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to the water tower and hospital timeframe feels inconsistent and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Elias's journey and the theme of honesty, but reliance on telling over showing (e.g., "weight of his lies dissolving") and a predictable ending diminish impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the radio wave garden offers originality, metaphors like "mosaic of light and shadow" are generic, and emotional depiction lacks nuance, often stating feelings directly rather than showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some cohesion, but the style leans toward overwriting, hindering clarity, and the short length feels limiting rather than deliberate, lacking deeper resonance.</comment>
