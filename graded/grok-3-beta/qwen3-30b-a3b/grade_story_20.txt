<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to regret and past failures is clear, but the archer’s personality lacks depth beyond brooding; the silver comb’s significance feels forced rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels incomplete; pacing is uneven with overemphasis on introspection, disrupting momentum within the word limit; cause and effect are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting of the inverted waterfall is striking and enhances the surreal tone; sensory details like ozone scent are evocative, though atmosphere occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (bridge as regret) are potent, but emotional impact is muted by overwrought language; ending offers closure but lacks profound resonance or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on predictable regret tropes without subversion; language borders on purple prose, diminishing authenticity; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story shows cohesion with creative use of elements, but style often hinders clarity with excessive metaphor; length feels restrictive rather than deliberate, missing deeper impact.</comment>
