<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's confusion as a diplomat is evident, but her motivation lacks depth and specificity; her internal conflict feels more stated than shown, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the key.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the action of liberalizing trade feels peripheral, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on imagery over progression, leading to a fragmented narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere, but the bus ride timeframe feels underutilized and disconnected from the subterranean mood, weakening overall immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (flock, key) are strong, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of Lira's conflict; the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying, lacking a sharp central tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While some metaphors are fresh, the story leans on predictable contrasts (above/below, progress/tradition) without subversion; emotional resonance feels stated rather than evoked, with occasional overwrought language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves partial cohesion with thematic intent, but the assigned elements often feel forced rather than organic; the style prioritizes imagery over clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
