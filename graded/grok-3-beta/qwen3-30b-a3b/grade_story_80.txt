<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like "wind howled like a trapped soul," enhancing mood, but the abandoned roller coaster setting feels somewhat disconnected from the haunted inn logs, weakening integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by overused metaphors like "map of uncharted territories" and a predictable riddle-solving trope; writing style lacks distinctiveness and occasionally veers into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but overly ornate style hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking a truly lingering resonance.</comment>
