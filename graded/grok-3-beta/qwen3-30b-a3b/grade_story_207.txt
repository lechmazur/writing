<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is somewhat clear with Elias seeking redemption, but the "meekly assertive" attribute feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the connection between the gossip columns and the resolution is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength with evocative sensory details like the universe’s hum, effectively enhancing the tone of joyful loneliness, though the setting’s connection to the bouquet feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a subtle emotional response through symbolism of the bouquet, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending sci-fi with personal redemption, but metaphors like “universe’s secret song” feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
