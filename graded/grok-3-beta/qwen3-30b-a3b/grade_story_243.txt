<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The jumpy necromancer’s anxiety is evident, but his deeper personality and motivations remain underdeveloped; unmasking the icon feels like a plot device rather than a personal drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly realized with sensory details like static and neon, enhancing the atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and fishhook feels slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its themes of rebellion, and imagery like the fishhook’s glow is striking, but the ending lacks full satisfaction and deeper subtext is thin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is somewhat original, metaphors like “ghost in the machine” feel clichéd; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the fishhook and video game world, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and depth beyond the narrative is limited.</comment>
