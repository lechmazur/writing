<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mute courier's silence is a defining trait, but his inner resolve and motivation to find hidden meanings lack depth and specificity; they feel more like narrative conveniences than fully realized character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the comet’s guidance driving the action, but the connection between beginning and end feels somewhat forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The run-down opera house and storm-battered harbor create a vivid, moody atmosphere with strong sensory details like snow and fractured stained glass; however, the setting’s connection to the mind’s escape concept is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of wonder and uses evocative imagery like the comet and mirror, but the emotional impact is diluted by over-explained themes; the ending is satisfying yet lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers some original imagery, it leans on predictable interdimensional travel tropes without subversion; metaphors are occasionally fresh but often verge on purple prose, detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the comet and opera house, but overly ornate language hinders clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly impactful one.</comment>
