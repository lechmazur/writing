<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s uncertainty as a champion is present, but her motivation feels underdeveloped; her transformation lacks depth and her voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a collaborative mural as a resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chalk cliff setting and church bells create a vivid, moody atmosphere with strong sensory details like glowing cliffs and tolling bells; however, the setting’s integration with character motivation could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of imperfect love, with some effective symbolism (brooch as bridge), but the conflict is understated, and the ending feels more hopeful than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a collaborative mural offers a fresh take, the language occasionally veers into overused metaphors (e.g., “stubborn flame”), and emotional nuance is stated more than shown, lacking unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, but the style is uneven, and the brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a faint lingering thought but lacks profound depth.</comment>
