<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters are intriguing but underdeveloped; the necromancer's hushed nature and motivation to map caves lack depth, and the cartographer feels like a side note despite potential for richer interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with mapping as the central action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is more thematic than narrative, lacking a punchy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly described with evocative sensory details, enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone and supporting the characters' mission, though the timeframe "between sets" feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response with themes of memory and resolve, but subtext is shallow; dialogue is purposeful yet sparse, and the central conflict of navigating the cave lacks intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in blending necromancy with futuristic elements, but metaphors like "static" and "film reel" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but not deeply nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length seems more a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly impactful one.</comment>
