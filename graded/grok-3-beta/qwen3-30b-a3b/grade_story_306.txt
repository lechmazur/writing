<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila’s background as a former child star and her authentic oddity are intriguing, but her motivations feel underdeveloped and inconsistent, lacking depth in how they drive her actions beyond a vague hunger for the impossible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous; the pacing is uneven, with rushed metaphysical leaps that undermine coherence and logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vibration analysis chamber and cathedral setting create a unique atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like ozone and forgotten dollhouses, but the tone of irreverent awe occasionally clashes with the darker themes, diluting the mood.</comment>
