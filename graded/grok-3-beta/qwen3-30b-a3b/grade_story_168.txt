<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena’s ruthlessness as a flower arranger feels underdeveloped and disconnected from her intellectual spontaneity; her motivation to decode rock art is clear but lacks depth in tying to her personality traits. The comb’s role reveals a guarded past, but her voice lacks distinctiveness in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a minimal arc within the word limit, with the action of decoding rock art driving the story forward. However, pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, lacking a stronger causal thread. Coherence is maintained but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and complements the tone of polite anarchy, with sensory details like the singer’s melody enhancing atmosphere. However, the timeframe (pauses between verses) feels underutilized, and the comb’s connection to the setting is weak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity but lacks deep emotional resonance or subtext beyond surface mystery. Imagery (stone circle shadows as fingers) is effective but sparse. Dialogue feels purposeful but not natural. The ending is intriguing yet unsatisfying, missing a stronger resolution or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of the watcher’s burden offers some originality, the story leans on familiar mystery tropes without subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh but often generic (“threads in a tapestry”). Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the style feels competent but not uniquely authorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story feels moderately cohesive with assigned elements, but they often seem forced rather than organic to the narrative. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice. There’s some creative thinking in combining elements, but the overall impact lacks depth or a lingering question.</comment>
