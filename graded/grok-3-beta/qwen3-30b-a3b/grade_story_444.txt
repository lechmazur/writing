<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ambassador Veyra’s motivation to hush illusions is clear, but her fierce attribute feels underdeveloped, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond determination. Her voice carries a distinct tone, yet the connection between her personality and the methodically playful approach is tenuous.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with the indoctrination driving the narrative, but the chain of letters as a method feels somewhat contrived, lacking seamless integration. Pacing is managed well, though the ending feels slightly abrupt, missing a stronger resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin and radio static timeframe create a haunting atmosphere, enhanced by vivid sensory details like creaking hulls and ocean breath. However, the setting’s connection to the ghost costume feels underexplored, slightly weakening the atmospheric cohesion with the character’s motivation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a melancholic response and uses symbolism (ghost costume as lost innocence) effectively. The central conflict of breaking shared dreams is clear, but the emotional depth is somewhat surface-level, relying more on telling than showing. The ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a unique premise, some metaphors (e.g., ocean’s breath) feel slightly overused. Emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced showing over stating. The tone remains consistent, but the style doesn’t stand out as exceptionally individual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the zeppelin and letters, but the integration occasionally seems forced rather than organic. The brief length works, yet lacks a lingering depth or question that elevates it beyond the narrative itself.</comment>
