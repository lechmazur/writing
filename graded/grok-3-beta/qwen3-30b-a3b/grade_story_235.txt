<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ancient Japanese castle setting and sensory details like yuzu and jasmine create an evocative atmosphere, but the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous at times.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive tone with thoughtful element integration, but its brevity feels like a limitation, not a choice, and it lacks the depth to leave a lasting impression.</comment>
