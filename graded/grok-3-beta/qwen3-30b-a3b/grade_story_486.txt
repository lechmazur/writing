<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sound engineer’s motivation to silence the crowd through silent retribution is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond her craft; her clumsily dexterous trait feels superficially applied rather than integral to her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with silent retribution driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the cause-effect relationship of the glass shattering into confessions is underdeveloped and slightly illogical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witch’s cauldron room and the hush of an erased chalkboard create a compelling, eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details like burnt herbs and resonant thrums, enhancing the tone of practical illusion, though the connection between setting and object could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its theme of accountability and uses effective imagery like “silent scream,” but the ending feels slightly abrupt, and the lack of dialogue or deeper subtext limits emotional resonance; conflict resolution is clear but not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of silent retribution is original, some metaphors (e.g., “chorus of shame”) feel generic, and emotional portrayal leans toward telling rather than showing; the narrative style is distinct but occasionally ornate, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the stained glass fragment, but the brief length seems more a limitation than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought of accountability, though style occasionally obscures clarity with over-elaboration.</comment>
