<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map trade routes is clear, but the orchardist’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond the “trustworthy unique” label; reactions to the phantom hand lack deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete due to abrupt dissolution of the city hall; pacing is rushed at the climax, undermining coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like salt and rust, enhancing the underwater setting; however, the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (leaves as maps) add depth, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling of feelings like “bittersweet grit”; ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a wandering orchardist is intriguing, metaphors like “multiverse’s veins” feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length feels more limiting than deliberate, lacking deeper lingering impact.</comment>
