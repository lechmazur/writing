<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The deputy’s impassive and personally impersonal nature is evident, but his internal shift toward yearning for grace feels abrupt and underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper motivation or backstory to ground it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the retrieval of the artifact, but the pacing feels uneven; the middle lingers too long on atmosphere, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to the deputy’s actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lush orchard in a cathedral is vividly rendered with sensory details like petrichor and the hum of bees, strongly enhancing the mood and supporting the concept of uncharted echoes; however, the timeframe of “during oil changes” feels awkwardly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood through symbolism (bees, twist tie) and subtext about grace and insignificance; the ending is purposeful, but the central conflict feels understated, and emotional resonance relies more on telling than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the concept of uncharted echoes and the orchard setting are original, some metaphors (e.g., “fragile thread between worlds”) feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated directly rather than shown through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the bees and orchard, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, the style sometimes prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
