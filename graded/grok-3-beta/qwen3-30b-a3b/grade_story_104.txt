<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The stoic steward's personality is somewhat evident through his quiet defiance and introspection, but his motivation lacks depth and feels more stated than shown; reactions to the bird skull cameo reveal little beyond surface-level rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations; the encrypted shipping label as a plot device is intriguing but underdeveloped, leaving cause and effect murky at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is evocative and enhances the atmosphere of forgotten wonders; sensory details like grinding gears and fogged glass are effective, though the orchard gate timeframe feels underexplored and disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild intrigue through symbolism of cracks and defiance, but emotional resonance is shallow; the theme of breaking conformity is clear yet lacks nuanced subtext or a truly satisfying ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like "cracks in the façade" feel overused and generic; emotional handling leans on explicit statements over nuanced showing, and the tone wavers slightly, lacking a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear yet uninspired, and while it leaves a lingering thought of rebellion, depth is limited by superficial execution.</comment>
