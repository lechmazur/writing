<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysandra’s glamorous undertaker persona is intriguing, but her motivation to preserve ancient practices feels somewhat surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding or conflict beyond the abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of elongating truth feels more conceptual than concrete, leaving the narrative progression vague and lacking in tangible conflict or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The social network archive as a setting is unique and ties to the theme of preservation, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere of jubilant remorse feels inconsistently conveyed through the setting itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story evokes a reflective mood with themes of legacy and ordinariness, and the brass tape as a symbol is effective; however, the emotional impact is muted by repetitive phrasing and a lack of sharp, specific conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a glamorous undertaker and the myth of ordinariness shows originality, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and overused motifs of legacy, lacking fresh metaphors or nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates its many elements with moderate cohesion, and there’s creative intent in combining them, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brevity exposes underdeveloped emotional stakes, leaving the impact less lingering than intended.</comment>
