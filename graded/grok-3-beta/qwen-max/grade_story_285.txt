<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The hesitant swordsman’s awkwardness is evident, but his motivation to restore traditional systems feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution. His interaction with the postcard reveals little beyond surface-level uncertainty, and his personality lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and end tied to the postcard’s message, but the action of emerging feels vague and lacks a strong causal link to the resolution. Pacing is uneven, with rushed introspection disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The frigid tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described and complements the tone of ephemeral rancor, enhancing the atmosphere of struggle. However, sensory details are inconsistently applied, and the setting’s connection to the postcard feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story attempts symbolism with hermit crabs and the postcard, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling rather than showing. The ending lacks punch, and while there’s a central conflict, it’s resolved too abstractly to feel satisfying or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés but relies on predictable metaphors (hermit crabs as resilience) without fresh subversion. Emotional handling is stated rather than nuanced, and the writing style feels generic at times, lacking a distinct authorial voice or surprising twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with the assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral. The style is clear but uninspired, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice. It lacks a lingering impact or deeper resonance.</comment>
