<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amara’s profession as a cuddler is intriguing and ties to her motivation to connect, but her internal conflict about prejudice feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; her voice is distinct but not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the beginning and end feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with the conductor’s appearance feeling rushed and somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is evocative and supports the tone of decay, but sensory details are sparse; the atmosphere aligns with the theme of ancient novelty, though it could be more immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Amara’s realization, but the symbolism of the ticket punch feels heavy-handed; dialogue is purposeful but not entirely natural; the theme of unspoken rules is present but lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a professional cuddler and ghostly conductor offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar supernatural tropes without subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but unremarkable, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
