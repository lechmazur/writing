<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape self-imposed chains is clear, but the transition from city planner to doomsday prepper lacks depth or backstory, making the personality feel somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the action of debasing fears through constellations is underdeveloped in its causal impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ancient Indian temple setting is vividly described with sensory details like incense, enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and object (ink blotter) feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on personal freedom through symbolism of chains and constellations, but dialogue is sparse and lacks distinctiveness; emotional impact is present but not fully resonant due to telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors (broken constellations) are fresh, but others (chains of fear) lean on clich√© without subversion; emotional handling shows nuance at times but occasionally states feelings directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
