<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with Elias’s optimistically bitter nature influencing his puzzle obsession, but his motivations lack depth and specificity; reactions to the puzzle feel predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a clear arc with the puzzle as a driving force, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the resolution, while symbolic, lacks a fully satisfying causal link to earlier events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting and mysterious atmosphere are vividly rendered and enhance the tone of secrecy, though sensory details are sparse and could be more evocative to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes some emotional response through Elias’s journey, with effective symbolism in the puzzle as a mirror; however, the ending feels slightly forced, and subtext lacks consistent depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the puzzle’s symbolic role, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes of mysterious packages and hidden truths without significant subversion; emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but it lacks the polish and depth for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought, though not a profoundly impactful one.</comment>
