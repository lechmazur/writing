<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the seashell's revelation driving progression, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The witch's flying carpet garage and half-lit corridor create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like burnt cedar and ozone, enhancing the tone of frantic peace, though the setting's connection to the object feels slightly tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative offers some originality in combining elements like the garage and seashell, with fresh imagery, but relies on predictable mystical tropes and lacks nuanced emotional depth, feeling slightly formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
