<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation to break free from expectations is clear, but her cosmic powers feel underdeveloped as a defining trait, lacking depth in how they shape her personality beyond a plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of "reviewing" feels passive and slows momentum; cause and effect between her powers and decisions are vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle-guarded terrace and abyss create a striking atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to Lira’s motivation feels more symbolic than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its theme of liberation, but relies heavily on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a sharp, memorable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic powers is intriguing, the execution leans on familiar tropes of hidden potential without subversion; metaphors like “liquid starlight” feel generic, lacking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves little lingering impact.</comment>
