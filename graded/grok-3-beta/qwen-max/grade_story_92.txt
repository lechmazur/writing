<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; Evelyn’s motivation tied to her mother’s past feels underdeveloped and her role as a dog walker for the ultra-rich is underutilized in shaping her personality or actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between Evelyn’s quest and Dr. Crane’s presence isn’t fully justified within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details like “damp wood” and “loud silence” enhancing the haunted mansion setting; however, the timeframe’s impact is more poetic than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with subtext about ethical compromises, but the emotional resonance is muted by surface-level dialogue and an ending that lacks a strong punch or lingering reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is present in the botanical collection and ethical dilemmas, but the haunted mansion trope feels predictable without subversion, and some descriptions like “watching her every move” are generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative elements, but it doesn’t fully transcend the constraints of its length or assigned elements, leaving a moderate impression without profound depth.</comment>
