<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's subtlety as a swordsman is intriguing, but his lack of a physical sword feels underexplored in shaping his actions; motivation to seek wisdom is clear but lacks depth in emotional stakes or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the schematic discovery drives the story, though cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The petrified forest setting is vividly described and enhances the mood of stillness and introspection; sensory details like the hum of the ground stand out, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story prompts reflection on wisdom versus knowledge, with decent use of symbolism (petrified forest as stagnation), but the emotional impact is muted; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a mental swordsman is original, some metaphors (moonlight on water) feel overused; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, risking a generic tone at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the schematic and forest, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering question about wisdom, though not powerfully so.</comment>
