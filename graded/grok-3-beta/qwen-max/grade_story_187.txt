<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, metaphors like "shadows cast by moonlight" are generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
