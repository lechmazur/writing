<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the minstrel's dismay and desire to map an endless night, but depth is lacking; reactions to the broken watch band feel symbolic yet underexplored, missing a distinct voice or nuanced personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the watch band revelation as a turning point, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and connections between beginning and end are more implied than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The black velvet sky-lounge and endless city create a striking, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of isolation and mystery, though sensory details beyond visuals are sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a quiet sense of longing and uses symbolism effectively with the watch band and photographs, but emotional impact is muted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept show originality, some metaphors (e.g., time slipping away) feel familiar, and emotional portrayal leans toward stating rather than showing nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the watch band, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
