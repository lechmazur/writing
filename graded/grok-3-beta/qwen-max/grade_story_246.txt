<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the concept of "polymerization" as a metaphorical act feels forced and lacks clear causal progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the premise shows some originality, the execution relies on familiar conspiracy and curse tropes without subversion; metaphors like "sentient silence" feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks polish, and the brevity feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
