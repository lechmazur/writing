<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The witch’s herb garden is vividly described with sensory details like lavender and metallic scents, enhancing the atmosphere of elegant mayhem; however, the setting’s connection to the telescope and transformation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning with themes of doubt and legacy, but the emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; imagery is strong in places, yet the ending lacks a satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some metaphors like “moonlight pooled like liquid silver” are fresh, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of witches and ancestral visions without subversion; emotional nuance is lacking, with feelings often stated.</comment>
