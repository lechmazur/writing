<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Seraphina’s glamour and patience are well-integrated into her role as an undertaker, shaping her unique perspective on death, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the notification as a turning point, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present but not strongly impactful, with some coherence lost in descriptive detours.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is intriguing and complements the theme of digital footprints, while sensory details like oil paints and lavender enhance atmosphere; however, the timeframe of paint mixing feels underexplored and disconnected from the core action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Seraphina’s realization of continuation, with decent use of symbolism (brass tape as legacy), but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; the ending is purposeful but not deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a glamorous undertaker in a digital archive offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., data streams as candlelight) feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but often stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of legacy, though not powerfully so.</comment>
