<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to bind old wounds is clear, but the portrayal lacks depth; "trustworthy strange" feels underexplored and doesn't distinctly shape actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the catapult action drives the story logically, though cause-effect links are somewhat vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with the atom-powered lighthouse and borrowed dawn tone, enhancing the mood; sensory details like humming and crackling air are effective, though smell and touch are absent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes determination and longing, with some symbolism in the tablecloth, but lacks deeper subtext or emotional nuance; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the concept of a time refugee and star-aligned catapult, but metaphors like "fragments of stars" feel generic; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; brief length works, though depth is sacrificed, leaving only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
