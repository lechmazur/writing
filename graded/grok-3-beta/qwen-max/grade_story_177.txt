<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to restore a lost art form is clear, but the traveler's personality as a rebellious obituary writer feels underdeveloped and lacks a distinct voice or deeper personal conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is vividly described with evocative sensory details like dust motes and humming resonance, enhancing atmosphere, though its connection to the timeframe of revolution feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the organ and mask, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language.</comment>
