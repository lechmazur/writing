<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Marcus's apologetic nature and past as a thug are stated but not deeply explored through actions or dialogue, lacking a distinct voice or nuanced motivation beyond surface-level regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure feels incomplete within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is vague, and pacing is rushed, with the museum method introduced but not meaningfully developed or resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is evocative and ties well to the tone, with sensory details like ozone enhancing atmosphere, but its connection to Marcusâ€™s motivation and the wooden slat feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the slat and a quietly intense tone, but emotional resonance is limited by telling over showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying resolution or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable redemption tropes without subversion; sensory details are somewhat generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, lacking a truly unique authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length limits depth, leaving little lingering impact or creative spark beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
