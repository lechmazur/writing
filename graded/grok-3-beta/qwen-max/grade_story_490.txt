<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of forbidden knowledge is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable tropes of mysterious technology without subversion; metaphors like "newborn galaxy" feel overwrought and generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, leaving lingering questions without depth or resonance.</comment>
