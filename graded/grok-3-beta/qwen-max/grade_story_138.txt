<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaric’s motivation to uncover hidden truths is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond a generic sense of loss; reactions to the drone and ticket stubs feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between ticket stubs and revelations are logical yet underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The spontaneous combustion lab setting is intriguing but underutilized; atmosphere supports the tone of hollow recklessness, though sensory details are sparse and fail to fully immerse the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about Alaric’s past, but lacks emotional depth or strong subtext; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and showing versus telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of forgotten nobility and hidden truths without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
