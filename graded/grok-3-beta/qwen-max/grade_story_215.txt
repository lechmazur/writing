<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the rattled exorcist’s inner conflict and social nature are mentioned but not deeply explored or reflected in meaningful actions. Motivation feels vague beyond the task at hand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between puzzles and ultimate revelation lacks depth. Cause and effect are logical but predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The psychic research facility is evocative and ties to the supernatural theme, but sensory details are sparse, and the dance lessons feel like an odd, underutilized backdrop to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of intrigue, but emotional impact is minimal due to surface-level character reactions. The ending is purposeful but lacks resonance; dialogue feels functional rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable supernatural tropes and generic descriptors like “otherworldly light.” Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive but uninspired, with assigned elements integrated adequately but not innovatively. It lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
