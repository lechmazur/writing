<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Callan’s carelessness as a pilot is mentioned but not deeply explored or tied to his actions in the grove; motivation feels vague and lacks personal stakes despite the borrowed memories concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between investigating doodles and emancipation is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details of the enchanted grove and a dreamy tone that complements the concept of borrowed memories; setting enhances the mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through imagery and mystery, with decent use of symbolism (glove, postcards), but lacks deeper subtext or a fully satisfying ending; conflict resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements like borrowed memories and sinister doodles, but metaphors occasionally feel overused (“mind unraveling at the seams”); emotional nuance is present but not fully developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but brevity seems to limit depth rather than enhance it; leaves a lingering question, though not a profound one.</comment>
