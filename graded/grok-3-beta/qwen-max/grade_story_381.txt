<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to map the cave systems is clear, but the necromancer aspect feels underdeveloped and disconnected from actions or personality; the baseball cap's sentimental value is mentioned but lacks depth in revealing character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning, middle, and end, but the action of "dominate" feels forced and unclear in execution; pacing is uneven, with reflective moments slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere, but the futuristic nostalgia tone occasionally clashes with the ancient setting; connection between setting and character motivation is present but not fully exploited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining necromancer with futuristic elements, but reliance on generic descriptors and predictable reflective tropes undermines uniqueness; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced or shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story achieves some cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
