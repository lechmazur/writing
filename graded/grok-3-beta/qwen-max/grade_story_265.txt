<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; the deputy's impassivity and cautious bravery are stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. Motivation to witness grace feels vague and disconnected from personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of stretching is present but doesn't drive a meaningful progression. Pacing feels meandering rather than purposeful, with weak cause-effect links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the orchard-cathedral hybrid is vividly described with strong sensory details, enhancing the surreal atmosphere. However, the timeframe of "during oil changes" feels forced and disrupts immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story has moments of evocative imagery and symbolism (e.g., apple, bees), but lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying ending. Conflict is minimal, and the theme of grace remains underdeveloped and surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the surreal setting offers some originality, the narrative relies on generic descriptors and predictable mystical elements (e.g., humming bees, perfect apple). Emotional depth is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite creative elements; assigned components are incorporated but often awkwardly (e.g., oil changes). Style is clear but lacks depth or lasting impact, with length feeling more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
