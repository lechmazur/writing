<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly described with bioluminescent fungi and cavern imagery, enhancing mood, but the connection between the subterranean colosseum and the amusement park ruins feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic use of the paper airplane, but emotional resonance is shallow due to limited character depth, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is middling; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic, and the brief length exposes gaps in depth, leaving little lingering impact or creative spark.</comment>
