<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liang’s portrayal as a chameleon stage actor is intriguing, but his rationally impulsive nature feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied to his actions. Motivation to weave emotional honesty into illusions is clear, but his reactions to the doll’s dress lack depth, missing a distinct personal voice or nuanced emotional response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with solving the cold-case mystery driving the narrative forward logically. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between the beginning and Mei’s story could be more tightly woven for stronger coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Chinese palace reimagined as a theater works well with the post-oil timeframe, creating a haunting atmosphere of decay. Sensory details like the scent of jasmine and sunlight through debris are evocative, though the setting’s connection to Liang’s motivation feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Mei’s longing for freedom, and imagery like shadows dancing on the floor adds depth. However, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the central conflict lacks intensity within the word limit, diminishing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it leans on familiar tropes of lost children and hidden truths without significant subversion. Metaphors are occasionally fresh, but emotional handling often states rather than shows, lacking nuanced subtext. The style is individual but not strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with the assigned elements, though some, like the post-oil timeframe, are underutilized. Creative thinking is evident in combining theater and mystery, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
