<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with eavesdropping driving the action logically, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret agent workshop and yard work setting are evocative and complement the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés but lacks originality; sensory details are generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced, missing a unique authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements, but they feel forced at times; the brief length limits depth, and while there’s creative intent, it doesn’t leave a lasting impression.</comment>
