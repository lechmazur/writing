<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character development is shallow; Evelyn’s role as a radio host channeling the dead is intriguing, but her motivations and past trauma lack depth and specificity. Leo’s introduction feels abrupt, and their shared pain is stated rather than shown through nuanced interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven; the meeting with Leo feels forced and disrupts the narrative flow. While there is a beginning and end, the middle lacks a strong arc, and pacing feels rushed within the word limit, sacrificing depth for resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The celestial grotto and living shadows create a vivid, eerie atmosphere that supports the tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to character motivation and action feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is middling; the chessboard symbolism and theme of diversity offer some depth, but emotional resonance is weak due to telling rather than showing. Dialogue is functional but lacks distinct voice or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable tropes of haunted pasts and sudden connections. Metaphors like shadows dissolving in water are somewhat fresh, but emotional handling feels surface-level, and the narrative lacks a unique authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overall, the story struggles with cohesion; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, and while there’s creative intent, the execution lacks polish and lasting impact.</comment>
