<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to decode temple inscriptions is clear, but the physician's personality feels underdeveloped; "bleary-eyed" and "quietly dramatic" lack depth in shaping distinct actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning (searching for answers) and resolution (coordinates revelation), but pacing feels rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between coffee grounds and cutlass are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Digital nomad camp and horizon’s edge timeframe create a unique, evocative atmosphere with strong sensory details (rustling palm leaves, generator hum); setting enhances the tone of dire enchantment effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story shows rather than tells through imagery (coffee grounds, cutlass glint), but emotional impact is muted; ending feels abrupt, lacking deeper resonance or subtext beyond surface revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clichés and shows originality in combining digital nomad life with ancient mystery, but metaphors like "constellations forming" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the cutlass and camp, but brevity feels like a limitation rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering question about the inscriptions, though not profoundly.</comment>
