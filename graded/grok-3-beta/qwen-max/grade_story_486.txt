<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation for silent retribution is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the "clumsily dexterous" trait, which feels superficially applied rather than integral to his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but the method of using pantomime confessions feels forced and disrupts the logical flow of his sonic manipulation focus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like sound manipulation, but the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice, leaving some depth unexplored.</comment>
