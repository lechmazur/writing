<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with moonlight and seashell imagery, but sensory details are sparse; setting supports tone but lacks deeper integration with character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some emotional tension and symbolism with the void, but impact is diluted by unclear conflict resolution and minimal subtext; ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but lacks originality; metaphors like "polished by secrets" feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story is somewhat cohesive with assigned elements, but they feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks depth or lingering impact.</comment>
