<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the shard as a catalyst, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks a strong causal link to prior events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some imagery (e.g., shard's weight) and the theme of standing for truth show promise, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of hidden artifacts and awakening automatons without fresh subversion; metaphors are occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is adequate with elements mostly integrated, but the story lacks a lingering depth or truly innovative spark; style is clear but not distinctive.</comment>
