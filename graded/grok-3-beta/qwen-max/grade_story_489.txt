<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but the unseen observer lacks depth or distinct voice; their "aggressively kind" attribute feels superficial and underexplored in action or reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between the dancer’s action and the observer’s response is tenuous and disrupts coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively haunting with vivid sensory details of the lighthouse and sea, enhancing the mood; however, the setting’s connection to the whistle and timeframe feels somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story evokes mild intrigue with symbolic use of the whistle, but lacks emotional depth or subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but reliance on ghostly figures and forgotten rituals feels trope-heavy without subversion; metaphors like the whale call are evocative but not entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
