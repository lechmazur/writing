<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Calla's motivation to reignite wonder is clear, but her "underestimated rebel" trait feels underdeveloped; her actions lack a distinct rebellious edge, and her voice isn't uniquely defined beyond generic introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc within the word limit; the mysterious call and meal encounter feel disconnected from a cohesive resolution, leaving the story's progression feeling incomplete and slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting effectively complements the ephemeral gloom, with sensory details like the biryani aroma enhancing mood, but the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through memory and loss, but the ending lacks impact; dialogue is purposeful yet sparse, and subtext around adaptation is present but not deeply explored or layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the biryani memory adds a unique touch, the narrative leans on predictable haunted house tropes without subversion; emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced depth or fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it leaves a faint lingering thought about adaptation, yet lacks the depth for a truly memorable impact.</comment>
