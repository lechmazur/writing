<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to guard the artifact is clear, but the "lonely ringleader" persona lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions feel predictable rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between beginning and end is tenuous, lacking strong cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of playful dread is effectively eerie in the ghost story booth, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the artifact feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery (floating ember, pulsing artifact) evokes mild intrigue, but emotional impact is shallow, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clichés but lacks originality; metaphors like "doubt curling around ankles" are generic, and emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive enough but feels constrained by its elements rather than elevated by them; lacks a lingering thought or creative spark to justify the brevity.</comment>
