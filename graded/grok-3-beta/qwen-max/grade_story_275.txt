<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear, but his "theoretically rebellious" nature feels underexplored and lacks depth in action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the planting and revival of the orchard, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between translating whispers and the action of planting is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard and burning comet create a vivid, eerie atmosphere with strong sensory details, effectively supporting the tone of desolation and subtle hope, though the timeframe's impact is less pronounced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through imagery and the hermit's persistence, with decent use of symbolism (pressed flowers, comet), but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in setting, the metaphors (e.g., skeletal branches) are somewhat predictable, and emotional depth feels stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks a lingering depth or question to elevate it beyond a competent, surface-level narrative.</comment>
