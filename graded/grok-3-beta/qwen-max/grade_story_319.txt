<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eryndor’s motivation to escape is clear, but his personality feels underdeveloped; the “resolutely wavering” trait is stated but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax of erasing symbols; cause and effect are logical, yet the resolution lacks depth or impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The tidal island setting is evocative with strong sensory details like mist and waves, enhancing the melancholic tone, but its connection to the character’s motivation feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Eryndor’s loss, with some effective imagery, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; the ending feels incomplete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes of escape and magical potions without subversion; metaphors are somewhat generic, and emotional nuance is limited to stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering impact or evidence of truly innovative thinking.</comment>
