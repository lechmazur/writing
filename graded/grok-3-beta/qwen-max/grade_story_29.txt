<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The knight's hopeful and cleverly naive nature is evident, but his inner depth and voice remain underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a logical connection between beginning and end, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are mostly clear but not always impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden and flickering streetlamp create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the setting's connection to the knight's motivation could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through the theme of regret, and imagery is effective, but the ending feels slightly predictable; subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, some metaphors (e.g., "clockwork spider") feel overused; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and the style lacks a truly distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
