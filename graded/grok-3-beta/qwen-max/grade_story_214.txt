<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is hinted at through loss and the search for meaning, but the lone trapper's personality lacks depth or distinct voice; reactions to the sea glass feel symbolic but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a subtle resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the decoding action drives the story, though connections between elements occasionally lack clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the floating observatory is evocative and enhances the mood of isolation; sensory details like "creaking metal corridors" are effective, though some atmospheric potential remains untapped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a quiet emotional response through themes of loss and acceptance; imagery and symbolism (sea glass, emptiness) are strong, but the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining elements, but metaphors like "black hole of doubt" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not consistently deep or shown through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
