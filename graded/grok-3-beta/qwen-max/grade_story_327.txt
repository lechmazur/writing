<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the road closure feels like a forced plot device; pacing is uneven, with the merchant interaction rushed, and coherence suffers from underdeveloped cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cave setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of tranquility, but the connection between setting and character motivation feels tenuous; tone complements the concept but isn't fully immersive.</comment>
