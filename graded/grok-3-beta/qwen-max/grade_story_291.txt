<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Calla Veyne’s daring nature as a ship captain is evident, and her motivation to confront prejudice is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond surface traits; her dialogue, while steady, doesn’t fully reveal a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and middle, but the resolution feels abrupt; pacing is uneven, with rushed confrontation at the end disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted mirror maze setting is evocative and enhances the eerie tone, with sensory details like fogged breath and rippling mirrors; however, the orchard cat and dying tree feel disconnected from the core atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Calla’s defiance, and imagery like “frozen stars” is striking, but the central conflict lacks depth, and the ending feels more abrupt than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a mirror maze reflecting prejudice is intriguing, some metaphors like “water disturbed by unseen hands” feel generic; emotional resonance is present but relies on stated resolve rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a limitation, and the lingering impact is minimal due to underdeveloped themes.</comment>
