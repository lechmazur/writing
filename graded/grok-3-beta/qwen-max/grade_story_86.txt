<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the archer’s apprehension and exceptional nature under pressure, but her personality lacks depth beyond these traits; reactions to the candle feel symbolic yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and middle, but the resolution feels rushed; cause and effect are logical, though pacing stumbles at the festival distraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the cyberpunk data center is vividly rendered with neon glow and digital constellations, enhancing atmosphere; sensory details are present but could be more varied beyond visual imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes a subtle emotional response through themes of truth and compassion, with effective imagery like the candle’s flame; however, dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the ending lacks a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending cyberpunk with archaic elements like the candle, but metaphors like “borrowed dawn” feel overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the candle and data center, but the brief length feels more like a limitation than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly.</comment>
