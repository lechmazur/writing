<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate but lacks depth; the swordsman’s apathy and defiance are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice or emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; the connection between meteors and the journey is intriguing yet underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating monastery setting is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere, with meteor showers adding a mystical tone; however, sensory details beyond sight are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storytelling has moments of impact with symbolic meteors and a lingering promise, but emotional resonance is weakened by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by familiar tropes of the weary warrior and mystical guidance; metaphors like “quiet flame” feel generic, and emotional portrayal lacks nuanced subtext, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the monastery and meteors, but it lacks the depth and polish for top-tier publication; it leaves a mild lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
