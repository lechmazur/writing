<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's earnest naivety is evident and drives actions, but lacks depth or distinct voice; motivation to map ancient wisdom feels surface-level and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; connection between wind chime melodies and resolution is intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>
