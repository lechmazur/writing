<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cassian’s moral code as a hacker is hinted at but underdeveloped; his motivation to uncover Valeria’s name is clear but lacks depth in personal stakes beyond a vague sense of redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between collecting bottle caps and the rake handle feels forced, and pacing is uneven with rushed revelations at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman marketplace with neon lights is vivid and complements the futuristic tone, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the bottle caps feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of defiance and redemption, but emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing; the ending is purposeful but not particularly striking or memorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a hacker in a futuristic Roman setting is intriguing, the narrative leans on predictable tropes of hidden history without fresh subversion, and emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it lacks a lingering impact or depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
