<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to master his reality is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the eternal student trope; reactions to the headlamp and journals feel functional rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot arc from discovery to digitization is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the ending lacks a stronger resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground city and post-star timeframe create a compelling, oppressive atmosphere; sensory details like damp walls are evocative, though more varied imagery could enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts thought on immortality's burden, with some symbolism in the headlamp, but emotional impact is muted by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet underwhelming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering thought on captivity, though not powerfully so.</comment>
