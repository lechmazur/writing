<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative imagery of the baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight, strongly supporting the tone, though sensory details could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has impact through symbolism and subtext, especially with the camera lens, but the emotional resonance is muted by limited character depth; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the unique setting and concept, with fresh metaphors like the spiderâ€™s web, though some descriptions verge on purple prose, slightly detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but it lacks the emotional punch and character nuance needed for top-tier publication; it leaves a lingering thought but not a profound impact.</comment>
