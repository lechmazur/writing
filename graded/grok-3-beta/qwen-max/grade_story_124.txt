<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in combining dance and lunar setting, but metaphors like "loomâ€™s warp and weft" feel overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but integration feels forced at times; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
