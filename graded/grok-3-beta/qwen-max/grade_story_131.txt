<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael’s aloofness is evident, but his motivation to transform fear into courage feels underdeveloped and somewhat generic; reactions to objects like the stones reveal limited depth in personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the gravitational anomaly feels disconnected from the emotional core; pacing is uneven, with rushed emotional resolution at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates an intriguing atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse; the setting supports the mood of chaos, yet its connection to Kael’s motivation remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kael’s discoveries, but symbolism (stones as resilience) feels heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful yet lacks lasting impact or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While not overtly formulaic, the story leans on predictable tropes of orphaned discovery without fresh subversion; emotional handling is stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; it lacks a lingering depth or truly creative integration of concepts.</comment>
