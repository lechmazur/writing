<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to unify scattered minds is clear, but the unlikely prophet's personality lacks depth and distinct voice; reactions to the wilted paper flower feel symbolic but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with abrupt shifts between laundromat and study; cause and effect between estrangement and resolution are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Giant's study setting is evocative with sensory details like groaning shelves, and the haunting delight tone complements the mood, but the laundromat feels underutilized and disconnected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some originality in the concept of glimmering transitions, but metaphors like "crack of ice" are overused; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story feels somewhat cohesive with assigned elements, but they often drive the narrative rather than serve it; length feels like a limitation, and depth is lacking despite lingering uncertainty.</comment>
