<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for self-acceptance is present but underdeveloped; the apprentice's inner conflict lacks depth and specificity, making her voice feel somewhat generic despite the personal journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the resolution of rebuilding the nest is symbolic but rushed, and the connection between beginning and end lacks a strong causal thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship setting is evocative and supports the tone of isolation, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Symbolism of the nest and ship as mirrors of the protagonistâ€™s state is compelling, but emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of an orchard ship is unique, the narrative leans on familiar lost-in-space tropes without subversion; metaphors like the nest are meaningful but not strikingly original, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought of resilience, yet lacks the depth for a truly memorable impact.</comment>
