<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's analytical innovation is evident in her approach to the USB drive, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding; her personality lacks a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the mystery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with the USB decryption driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; the arc is present but lacks a fully satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned control tower enhances the eerie tone, and sensory details like the scent of rain effectively build atmosphere, though the connection between setting and timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
