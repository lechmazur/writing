<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; Elias’s "gracefully awkward" trait is mentioned but not deeply integrated into his actions or dialogue, missing a distinct voice. Motivation to learn healing traditions feels vague and secondary to the letter’s mystery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks a fully satisfying arc within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end is present but feels rushed, with pacing issues in the final betrayal and resolution. Cause and effect are logical but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of the ossuary-turned-restaurant is striking and enhances the tone of harsh tenderness, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion. Atmosphere supports the concept of hidden agendas, though inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes mild emotional response through shared pain, but lacks deeper subtext or memorable uniqueness. Dialogue is functional but not particularly natural. Central conflict is present but resolved too abruptly for impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable betrayal tropes and generic descriptors like “piercing green eyes.” Emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, lacking fresh metaphors or a distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is moderate; assigned elements are incorporated but often feel forced rather than organic. Style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
