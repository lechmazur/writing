<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Kael's anger and betrayal, but his personality lacks depth beyond the surface ire; the chopstick's significance feels forced rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is incomplete, with a beginning and middle but no true resolution; pacing feels rushed at the end, and the memorializing action lacks a strong causal impact on the story's direction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport is evocative and supports the desolate mood, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and object feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some emotional resonance through Kael's ritual, with decent use of symbolism (tea leaves, chopstick), but the ending lacks impact, and the conflict feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in the tea leaf ritual, but metaphors like "liquid silver" are clich√©d, and emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing nuanced reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks a lingering depth or memorable impact.</comment>
