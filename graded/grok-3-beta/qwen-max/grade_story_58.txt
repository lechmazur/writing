<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn meditation is clear, but the "fiercely loyal" trait feels underexplored and disconnected from her internal struggle; her voice lacks distinctiveness in the limited dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of radicalizing perspective is present but lacks a strong causal link to a resolution, leaving the pacing uneven and the ending abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone of dread, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the character’s motivation feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some emotional resonance and symbolism (moths mirroring inner turbulence) are present, but the conflict is underdeveloped, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying impact; subtext exists but isn’t deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of balancing storms is intriguing, the execution relies on somewhat generic imagery (moths, darkness); emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuanced originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the brief length feels like a limitation, and the lingering impact is minimal due to underdeveloped depth.</comment>
