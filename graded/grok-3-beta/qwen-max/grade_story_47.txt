<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to defy mortality is intriguing, but the "dutiful ward" lacks depth and distinct voice; actions feel driven by plot needs rather than personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with auditions as a backdrop, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between clues and resolution are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the "soundless sanctuary" is evocative and supports the tone of graceless beauty; sensory details are sparse but effective when used.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes curiosity with subtext about mortality, and imagery like the glove is symbolic, but emotional resonance is undercut by telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but metaphors like "jagged edges" feel overused; tone is consistent, yet emotional depth lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but brevity limits depth; it leaves a lingering question about the glove, though style occasionally overreaches clarity.</comment>
