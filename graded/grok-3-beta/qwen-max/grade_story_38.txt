<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation around non-violence is intriguing but underdeveloped; the insomniac poet's personality lacks depth beyond sleeplessness and obsession, missing a distinct voice or nuanced reaction to the botanical samples.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between whispers and non-violence is logical yet not fully explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted attic setting enhances the eerie tone effectively, with sensory details like the sharp scent adding immersion; however, the timeframe "between subway stops" feels disconnected and underutilized in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on non-violence and restraint, with strong symbolism in the glowing bottle; ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character exploration and minimal subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in linking plants to non-violence, but reliance on predictable "haunted" tropes and generic whispers detracts; writing style is clear but lacks a unique voice or fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like botanical samples, but brevity seems more a limitation than a choice; it leaves a lingering idea of restraint, though depth is constrained by underdeveloped character and theme.</comment>
