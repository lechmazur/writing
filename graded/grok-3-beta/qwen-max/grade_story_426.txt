<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve folk medicines is intriguing but underdeveloped; Lira’s secretive nature and aloof passion lack depth in action and dialogue, making her feel more like a sketch than a fully realized figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between hacking music playlists and uncovering remedies feels forced and lacks logical grounding, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly described with evocative decay, enhancing the eerie tone, but sensory details are uneven, and the setting’s link to folk medicine feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story lacks emotional depth and subtext; the ending hug feels abrupt and unearned, while imagery is present but not impactful enough to elevate the narrative beyond surface-level intrigue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements like music hacking and folk remedies, but reliance on predictable haunted setting tropes and generic emotional descriptors (e.g., “surge of emotions”) undermines authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story feels fragmented despite creative elements; brevity seems a limitation rather than a choice, and while there’s potential in the concept, execution lacks the polish and depth for lasting impact.</comment>
