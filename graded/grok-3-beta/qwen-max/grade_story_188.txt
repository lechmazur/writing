<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Haruto's background as a former lawman is hinted at, but his personality and motivations lack depth; his reactions to the spectacles and broken pieces feel somewhat generic and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of stirring ashes driving a symbolic discovery, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and cause-effect links are not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Japanese castle and seed-planting timeframe create a vivid backdrop, enhanced by sensory details like moss and ash, though the atmosphere could more strongly tie to Haruto’s internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through imagery of broken mirrors and past failures, with a satisfying ending, but lacks deeper subtext or a fully developed central conflict within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, metaphors like “shards of glass” feel overused, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing; originality is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
