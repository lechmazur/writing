<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zyl's "jumpy" nature and necromancer identity are present but underdeveloped; his curiosity-driven motivation to unmask the Glitch feels clear but lacks depth or personal stakes, making his actions feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and implied continuation, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit; the connection between analyzing paint drips and unmasking the Glitch is intriguing yet underexplored, leaving some logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly described with pixelated neon glows and glitching code, enhancing the atmosphere; sensory details like simulated moonlight are effective, though the tone of "clear complexity" occasionally feels forced against the setting's inherent chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has a central conflict and tension with the pursuit of truth, but emotional impact is muted due to reliance on telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a deeper resonance or subtext beyond the surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining a necromancer with a digital world, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors (e.g., "frantic rhythm") feel generic; emotional nuance is present but not fully developed, and the style lacks a truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped aspects; it leaves a lingering question about the Glitch, though the style occasionally hinders clarity with over-descriptive passages.</comment>
