<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Agnes's ruthlessness and intellectual spontaneity are present but underdeveloped; her motivation to decode the rock art feels clear but lacks depth in execution. Her interaction with the comb is a nice touch but doesn't fully reveal her inner world. Her voice is distinct yet not fully compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of distinguishing the rock art driving the narrative. However, the spontaneous road trip conversations feel slightly forced as a method, and pacing is uneven, with the ending feeling rushed despite a coherent structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mysterious stone circle setting is evocative and ties well to the timeframe of the singer’s verses, enhancing the mood. Sensory details are present but not vivid enough to fully immerse. The atmosphere supports the watcher’s burden concept, though the connection to the comb feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about the stones’ meaning, with some symbolism in the mirroring concept, but lacks strong emotional impact. Dialogue is purposeful but not natural. The ending is satisfying yet not memorable. Subtext exists but isn’t deeply layered or thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés, it lacks a truly unique perspective, relying on predictable mystery tropes around ancient stones. Sensory details are somewhat generic, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown. The style is clear but not distinctive or innovative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with the assigned elements, though they sometimes feel imposed rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice. There’s creative thinking in the mirroring revelation, but it doesn’t leave a strong lingering impression.</comment>
