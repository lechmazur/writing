<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's whimsical nature as a tinkerer is evident, and her motivation to chronicle environmental changes is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the surface trait of whimsy, and her voice isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with sculpting driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the connection between environmental changes and the fortune-teller's purpose isn't fully fleshed out, leaving minor coherence gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace on stalactites is vividly described and enhances the atmosphere of fragility, complementing the theme of mortality; however, sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to fully immerse the reader in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet reflection on mortality and change, with effective symbolism in the thermometer, but the emotional impact is somewhat muted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels more contemplative than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a whimsical tinkerer confronting mortality via fortune-tellers is original, some metaphors (e.g., "captured star") feel slightly overused, and emotional resonance relies on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally leans on repetitive phrasing, and the lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
