<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Alistair's cunning and morally ambiguous nature are hinted at but not deeply explored; his motivation feels vague and lacks specificity, failing to fully connect with his actions or the seed packets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc or resolution within the word limit; the sudden urge and xerographing action feel disconnected from a coherent narrative progression, leaving the story feeling incomplete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower setting is evocative and ties well to the tone of gentle chaos, with some sensory details enhancing mood, but the supermarket origin feels underutilized and disconnected from the tower's atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper meaning with the seeds as symbols, but the emotional impact is muted; it relies too much on telling rather than showing, and the ending lacks a satisfying punch or clear conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding forgotten seeds is intriguing, the execution feels somewhat formulaic with generic descriptors; metaphors like "siren call" are overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from unclear motivation and resolution; the style is occasionally overwrought, hindering clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
