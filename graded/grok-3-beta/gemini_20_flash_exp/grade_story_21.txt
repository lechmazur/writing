<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; connections between actions and genetic decoding motivation are logical but lack compelling development or tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting of the forgotten city hall and sensory details like musty air are evocative and support the mood, but drum circles and theater elements feel disconnected from the core narrative, diluting atmospheric impact.</comment>
