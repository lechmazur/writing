<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to rescue ancient traditions is clear, but the "aggressively kind" attribute feels underexplored and inconsistent with the silent, unseen role; lacks distinct voice or depth in first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete despite the word limit; the action of flinging the whistle drives the story but lacks clear cause-effect logic with the dancer’s performance; pacing is uneven, feeling rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse setting is evocative with strong sensory details like salt and moonlight, enhancing atmosphere; however, the connection between setting and whistle feels tenuous, and tone slightly overdone for the concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some emotional resonance and symbolism with the whistle as a beacon, but the impact is diluted by overt telling over showing; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying; lacks sharp conflict or subtext depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on clichéd imagery like "dying star" and "beacon in darkness" without subversion; metaphors are generic, and emotional handling feels stated rather than nuanced; lacks a truly original perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but feels built around them rather than using them organically; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate; minimal lingering impact.</comment>
