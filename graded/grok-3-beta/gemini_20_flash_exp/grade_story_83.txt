<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to "sow seeds of a better tomorrow" is clear but lacks depth; the "suspiciously trusting" trait feels underexplored and doesn't significantly shape actions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between tracing the wick and encountering the Shadow Beast lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth of broken mirrors creates a strong visual atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse; the timeframe of "leaf raking season" feels tacked on and disconnected from the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about the Shadow Beast encounter, but lacks emotional depth or subtext; imagery of mirrors is intriguing yet underdeveloped, and the ending feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of tracing a candle wick is unique, the narrative leans on familiar cryptid-hunter tropes without subversion; emotional resonance is stated rather than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity; it lacks a lingering impact or deeper question for the reader.</comment>
