<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with Elias as a calm doomsayer, but his personality lacks depth beyond surface traits; the skateboard connection feels symbolic but underexplored in revealing inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the end; the action of resuming work is logical but lacks significant progression or stakes to drive tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop and barn loft at sunrise create a vivid atmosphere with strong sensory details like grimy windows and train whistles; however, the settingâ€™s connection to the skateboard feels forced and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through themes of rebellion and loss, with decent symbolism in the skateboard; yet, the conflict lacks sharpness, and the ending feels more contemplative than impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Writing shows some originality in combining steampunk with personal relics, but relies on predictable tropes of quiet rebellion; metaphors like "gods of stagnation" feel slightly overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice to elevate it beyond a competent draft.</comment>
