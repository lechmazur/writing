<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to find hidden waterfalls feels underdeveloped and somewhat arbitrary; the irate nature of Jax is mentioned but not deeply explored through actions or voice, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear shift from searching to discovery, but the connection between tea leaf reading and the docking bay feels forced and lacks logical grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport is evocative with sensory details like "cracked durasteel" and "pre-dawn chill," enhancing atmosphere, though the connection between setting and waterfalls feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story attempts subtext with the heart's revolt and tea leaves as symbols, but emotional impact is muted by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; ending lacks a strong punch despite a sense of purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of tea leaf reading offers some originality, the narrative leans on familiar smuggler tropes without subversion; metaphors like "heart's revolt" feel somewhat generic and overexplained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel imposed rather than organic; brief length feels like a constraint, not a choice, with lingering questions lacking depth.</comment>
