<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "uniquely literal" trait is intriguing and shapes her approach to decoding, but her motivation feels surface-level and lacks deeper emotional grounding; her reactions and voice are not distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of overcharging driving a resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between notes and star maps are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse basement enhances the eerie tone and complements the concept of ancient secrets, with strong sensory details like salt and decay; however, the post-war timeframe feels underexplored in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about the star maps, and the ending is purposeful, but it lacks emotional depth, subtext, or memorable literary devices; it tells more than shows, especially in Elara's determination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding star maps offers some originality, the narrative relies on predictable discovery tropes without subversion; sensory details are adequate but not vivid, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, but it lacks a lingering impact or depth; the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, missing deeper creative resonance.</comment>
