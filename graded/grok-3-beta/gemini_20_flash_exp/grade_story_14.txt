<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the connection between beginning and end feels tenuous, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on atmosphere over action progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station setting is vividly described with sensory details, enhancing the mood, but the connection between setting and candle mold feels forced, and the atmosphere only partially supports the motivation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than integral; the style is clear but lacks a lingering impact or evidence of profound creative synthesis.</comment>
