<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a decoder is intriguing, but the "professional scapegoat" trait feels underexplored and disconnected from actions; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions to the washer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the library as the next step is vague, and pacing is uneven with too much focus on introspection over action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, metaphors like "symphony of secrets" feel generic; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story shows creative intent with assigned elements, but cohesion suffers from vague resolution and overemphasis on introspection; lacks lingering depth or clarity in style.</comment>
