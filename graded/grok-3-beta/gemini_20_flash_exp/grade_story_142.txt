<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's "broke aristocrat" status and "realistically odd" attribute are present but underdeveloped; his motivation to uncover secret recipes feels clear but lacks depth in emotional stakes or personal conflict. His decision to walk aligns with his oddity, but his voice and reactions remain somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong arc or resolution within the word limit; the action of harmonizing feels abstract and doesn't drive a clear narrative progression. Pacing is uneven, with too much focus on description over conflict or cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting and "blurry vividness" tone are evocative, with strong sensory details like rust and twilight hues. However, the connection between the setting and the botanical illustration feels forced, and the atmosphere only partially supports the character's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story has some emotional resonance and subtext about legacy, with decent imagery (roller coaster as skeletal beast). However, the ending lacks impact, conflict is vague, and the theme of harmonizing past and present feels underdeveloped. It tells more than shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a broke aristocrat in a haunted park is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable tropes of hidden legacies without subversion. Metaphors like "skeletal beast" are overused, and emotional depth is stated rather than nuanced. Writing style lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive in tone but not in narrative purpose; assigned elements are integrated but often feel forced rather than organic. The brief length feels like a limitation, not a choice, and the lingering impact is minimal due to unresolved tension.</comment>
