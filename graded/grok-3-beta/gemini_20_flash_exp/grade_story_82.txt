<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the discovery of secrets driving progression, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between farmhouses and the curse's resolution is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The futuristic hub and hidden sunrise create an interesting contrast, but sensory details are sparse, and the orchard's atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the mystery or Elara's motivation.</comment>
