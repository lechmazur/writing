<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alistair's seasickness and awkward charm are noted but underdeveloped, lacking depth in how they shape his actions or voice. Motivation to confront the mirror is intriguing but feels abstract and underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the transformation action driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between traded secrets and the bulb's power is vague, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystal fortress and rainbow canyon create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the nostalgic tone and supports the transformation. Sensory details are present but could be more specific to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of longing and defiance, with some effective imagery (e.g., bulb's glow), but lacks deeper subtext or emotional nuance. The ending feels purposeful yet predictable, missing a stronger punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a seasick officer and ghost orchid bulb offers originality, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of destiny and mirrors without subversion. Language occasionally feels ornate, detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with creative use of elements like the bulb and fortress, but the style sometimes obscures clarity. It leaves a lingering sense of longing, though not enough depth for a lasting impact.</comment>
