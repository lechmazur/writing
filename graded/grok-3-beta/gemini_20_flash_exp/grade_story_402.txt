<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; unearthing the bottle drives the story, but pacing is uneven, with an abrupt shift to the raft journey at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard setting is evocative with strong sensory detail of roots and bones, enhancing the eerie tone, but the atmosphere's connection to the raft and timeframe feels tenuous.</comment>
