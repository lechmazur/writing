<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's rashness as a protector is mentioned but not convincingly shown through actions; her shift to quiet contemplation feels abrupt and unmotivated by prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot lacks a strong driving action, with the detour feeling incidental rather than pivotal; pacing is uneven, and the arc feels incomplete despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wind-swept fortress and caverns create a vivid atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting's connection to the postcards feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some imagery and symbolism (postcards as cosmic keys) show promise, but emotional impact is stated rather than shown, and the ending lacks a punchy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story leans on predictable cosmic tropes without subversion, metaphors like "cosmic mosaic" feel overused, and emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While cohesive in theme, the story feels forced around assigned elements, lacks stylistic clarity, and fails to leave a lasting impression or depth.</comment>
