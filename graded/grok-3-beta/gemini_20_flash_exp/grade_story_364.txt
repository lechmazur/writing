<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a basic arc within the word limit, with the action of following hieroglyphs driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the transition to the past, and cause-effect links between symbols and time travel are vague, reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The temporal anomaly study setting and timeframe of a silent revolution complement the mundane miracles tone well, with sensory details like unfamiliar blossoms and blacksmith hammers enhancing immersion, though the connection between setting and object could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story prompts mild reflection on lost trades and time, with some effective imagery like "quiet whispers of a lost world," but lacks a strong emotional impact or deeper subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant, and conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining time travel with mundane miracles, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptors like "relentless march of time" feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
