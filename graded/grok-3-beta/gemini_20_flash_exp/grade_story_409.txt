<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the bruised fighter seeking truth, but the portrayal lacks depth; "skillfully incompetent" feels stated rather than shown through nuanced actions or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed, and the connection between the action of abduction and the resolution is vague, lacking clear cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dusty attic and clockwork animals create a vivid atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s connection to the character’s motivation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some symbolism with the shard as a mirror is effective, but emotional impact is limited by overt telling of feelings rather than showing; the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While there’s an attempt at originality with the shard and dreams, the narrative leans on predictable self-discovery tropes without subversion, and metaphors like “chasm to cross” feel generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but lacks a lingering impact or depth; the style is functional but not distinctive, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
