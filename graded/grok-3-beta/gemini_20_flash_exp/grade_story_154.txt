<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "strongly weak" attribute is intriguing but inconsistently portrayed; her trembling at harsh words feels underdeveloped and her sudden courage lacks grounding in prior actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels incomplete within the word limit; levitation as the climax is abrupt, and the connection between tracking urban legends and social changes is vague, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Celtic village with neon graffiti is visually striking and complements the tone of jubilant despair, but sensory details are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of collective will is somewhat original, the execution relies on predictable tropes of hidden power and lacks fresh metaphors or nuanced emotion, feeling formulaic at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves basic cohesion with assigned elements, but the style lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
