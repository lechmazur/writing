<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's nimbleness and metaphysical nature are intriguing but underdeveloped; her motivation to preserve dances feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the storm of secrets drives tension, but pacing feels rushed, and connections between map, dances, and yearbooks remain vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard setting is evocative and complements the tone of jaded wonder, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance Elara's motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery like the storm of secrets is striking, but emotional impact is limited by telling over showing; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks deeper subtext or resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept is original, metaphors like "storm of secrets" feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is lacking, and the style occasionally veers into ornate prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates elements with moderate cohesion, but the style feels overly elaborate at times, and the brief length seems more a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
