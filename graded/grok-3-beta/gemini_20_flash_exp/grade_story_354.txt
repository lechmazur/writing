<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a wizard in a digital archive is unique, the execution relies on predictable tropes of discovery and lacks fresh metaphors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with some creativity, but cohesion suffers from forced connections; the style is overly ornate at times, hindering clarity, and the impact feels shallow despite potential depth.</comment>
