<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is evocative and ties well to the atmosphere of chaos, with sensory details like the hum of symbols enhancing mood, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Kai’s journey, with some symbolism in the stones and ticket, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable perspective; conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the lottery ticket, but the style occasionally overexplains, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
