<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While some imagery is fresh, the narrative leans on generic descriptors and predictable melancholy, lacking a truly unique voice or surprising subversion of tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its elements, but the style often prioritizes ornate language over clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
