<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth; curiosity about life's raw edge is stated but not convincingly shown through actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the receipt and the encounter feels contrived; pacing is uneven, with the buildup overshadowing a rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall setting is evocative and ties to the theme of forgotten connections, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere doesn't fully enhance the digital-real dichotomy central to the concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of human connection, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of showing over telling; dialogue is minimal but purposeful, though the ending lacks a strong punch or lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a social media exorcist is original, the execution relies on familiar tropes of mysterious encounters without subversion; metaphors like "digital demons" feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with its elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
