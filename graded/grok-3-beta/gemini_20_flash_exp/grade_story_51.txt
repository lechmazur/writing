<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marco's portrayal as an apologetic thug is intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivation to learn resilience is clear but lacks depth in execution, and his voice feels somewhat generic despite the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot's arc feels incomplete within the word limit; the action of outlasting the past drives the story but lacks a concrete resolution, and pacing feels rushed toward the end with abrupt shifts in focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is evocative and supports the tone of transition, but sensory details are sparse, and the connection between setting and object feels tenuous, missing deeper atmospheric integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marco's resolve, but literary devices like symbolism of the crate slat are heavy-handed; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a memorable impact or subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of breaking free from the past is handled with some originality, the narrative relies on predictable redemption tropes, and emotional expression often feels stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a basic cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but uninspired, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
