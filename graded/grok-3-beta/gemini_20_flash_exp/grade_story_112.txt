<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve indigenous recipes is clear, but Elias lacks depth beyond this single drive; his "factually imaginative" trait feels underexplored and doesn't distinctly shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels incomplete; the action of "grilling" the archive is metaphorical and weak in driving tangible progression, and pacing is uneven with rushed emotional conclusions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The writing system archive setting is evocative and ties well to the concept of forgotten knowledge, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports the mournful tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through themes of loss and preservation, but overreliance on telling rather than showing, and lack of subtext, diminishes impact; ending feels purposeful but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding recipes from a hopscotch board is original, the writing leans on generic descriptors and predictable emotional beats; metaphors like "snowflake melting" feel overused and lack freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
