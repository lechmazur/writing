<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's ability to see ghosts is intriguing, but his motivation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth beyond a generic desire for peace; his clumsiness is mentioned but not consistently reflected in action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the action of dissecting the crown feels more symbolic than plot-driven; pacing is uneven, with too much focus on introspection over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is an unusual setting but lacks sensory detail to ground the atmosphere; the silence is evocative, yet its connection to the setting and action feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story attempts deeper meaning through the symbolism of silence and ghosts, but the emotional impact is muted by over-telling rather than showing; the ending offers a glimmer of resolution but lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of silence and ghosts offers some originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes of haunted characters seeking closure; metaphors like "siren call" feel overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with its assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; the style is clear but lacks a distinctive voice, and the short length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
