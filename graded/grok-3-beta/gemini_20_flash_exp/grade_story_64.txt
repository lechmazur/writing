<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the action of safeguarding and the coded scuffs feels tenuous; pacing is uneven, with the ending rushed and lacking resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating marketplace is vividly described and complements the tone of mundane miracles, but sensory details are sparse beyond sight, and the setting's connection to the cracked scale feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes of understanding over immortality, with some effective imagery, but lacks emotional resonance or a satisfying ending; conflict is present but underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept shows originality, the execution relies on somewhat generic descriptors and predictable alchemist tropes without subversion; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; the brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate, and the impact is muted.</comment>
