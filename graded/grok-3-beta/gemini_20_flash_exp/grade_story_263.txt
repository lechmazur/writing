<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Coral's "calculatedly playful" attribute shapes his personality uniquely, but his motivation to retell epics from a villain’s view feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in execution; reactions to the plush are superficial, missing deeper revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The action of consolidating power drives the plot, but the method of reversed echoes feels conceptually intriguing yet narratively vague; pacing is uneven, with a rushed resolution that undermines a complete arc within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coral reef city setting is evocative and complements the sonic manipulation concept, but sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere only partially supports Coral’s motivation; the plush feels disconnected from the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story prompts some thought on morality’s reflection, with decent use of symbolism (reversed echoes), but lacks emotional resonance and subtext; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying, and conflict resolution is shallow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of reversed echoes is original, the narrative leans on predictable villain-reframing tropes without subversion; sensory details are generic, and emotional handling is more stated than shown, lacking nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but uninspired, and the short length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice; lacks lingering impact.</comment>
