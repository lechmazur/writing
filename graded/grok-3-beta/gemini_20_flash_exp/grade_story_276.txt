<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to learn universal patterns is clear, but Elias's "uneasy" nature feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in action or voice; reactions to the coathanger are intriguing but not fully tied to personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete; the shift from orbital data to human stories is abrupt and lacks sufficient buildup within the word limit, though the coathanger's role as a key is a creative pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orbital debris station setting is vividly described with sensory details like ozone and stale coffee, but its connection to the coathanger and redemption theme feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild reflection on interconnectedness, with decent symbolism in the coathanger and postcards, but the ending feels overly neat and lacks a strong emotional punch or lingering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of finding meaning in mundane objects is somewhat fresh, the narrative leans on predictable epiphanies and generic descriptors; emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate; lacks a truly lingering impact.</comment>
