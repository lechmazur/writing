<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Anya’s guilt as a swordswoman is mentioned but not deeply explored; her motivation to escape guilt feels surface-level and lacks specificity in how it drives her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The plot lacks a clear arc within the word limit; the pursuit of the unknown feels vague, and the transition to the labyrinth is abrupt, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The neon sign repair shop setting is evocative with sensory details like the electric thrum, but its connection to the tribal mask and door of release feels tenuous and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some imagery (neon flickering, mask carvings shifting) is striking, but the story lacks emotional depth and a satisfying resolution; it tells more than shows Anya’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the concept of a guilty swordswoman seeking release is intriguing, the execution relies on generic descriptors and predictable mystical tropes without fresh subversions or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, but the style feels overwrought at times, and the brief length feels like a limitation rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
