<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters, particularly the driver and assassin, have distinct motivations (duty vs. contract) that shape their actions, but their inner conflicts and voices feel underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the shift from tension to reconciliation is abrupt, undermining coherence despite strong thematic ties to the unforgiving road.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting and borrowed starlight tone create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with evocative sensory details, enhancing the story’s mood and complementing the characters’ struggles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext evoke emotion and reflection, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict resolves too neatly, and dialogue, while minimal, feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective, some metaphors (e.g., dawn in trembling hands) feel overused, and emotional depth occasionally leans on explicit statement rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought, but stylistic flourishes sometimes hinder clarity, and the brevity feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
