<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The seasoned woodsmanâ€™s motivation to map abandoned railways is clear and aligns with his rugged, solitary nature, but his emotional depth regarding Mara feels underdeveloped. His voice is distinct in imagery but lacks consistent personal nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from mapping to confession ties beginning to end, but pacing feels uneven with rushed emotional resolution. The action of mapping via echoes is logical, yet the hospital context disrupts narrative flow at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is vividly imagined with sensory details like static dandelions, enhancing the surreal atmosphere. However, the hospital timeframe feels underexplored as a grounding contrast, weakening setting cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (garden, rails as promises) and a lingering theme of honesty evoke thought, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling over showing. The ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant due to rushed grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its surreal garden and echo-mapping concept, with fresh metaphors. However, some emotional expressions feel generic, and the tone shifts slightly in the final lines, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the hairbrush and honesty, leaving a lingering question of loss. Yet, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate imagery, hindering clarity and emotional depth.</comment>
