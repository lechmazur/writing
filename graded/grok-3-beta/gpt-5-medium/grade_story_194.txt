<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential with the "spirited lumberjack" trait influencing actions, but motivation feels slightly inconsistentâ€”learning healing traditions seems secondary to other plot elements. The first-person voice is distinct but occasionally overwritten.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc with the revamping action driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolutions and overpacked imagery disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>World-building excels with the ossuary-turned-restaurant setting, enhanced by vivid sensory details like "bay leaves and burned cedar," creating a haunting atmosphere that supports the tone of harsh tenderness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with evocative imagery and subtext about healing and war, but the ending feels slightly forced, and emotional resonance is sometimes stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by occasional overuse of ornate metaphors that verge on purple prose, though the concept of a lumberjack in a gourmet ossuary offers a unique angle; some emotional beats lack nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is adequate with creative use of elements, but the style leans too heavily on dense imagery, obscuring clarity at times; the story leaves a lingering thought but lacks polish for top-tier publication.</comment>
