<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "logically emotional" attribute is intriguing and shapes actions with calculated tenderness, but motivation feels slightly abstract; first-person voice is distinct yet occasionally over-elaborate, risking detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the action of mapping tunnels drives the story, though some causal links are vague, diminishing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Whispering gallery setting is vividly realized with sensory details like jasmine and dust, enhancing atmosphere and action; tone of grandiose modesty complements the concept, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery creates subtext, and the story prompts reflection on survival and mercy; however, emotional impact is muted by over-intellectualized prose, and the ending lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose; emotional nuance is present yet sometimes stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and brevity seems deliberate; however, overly complex style slightly hinders clarity, and lingering impact is present but not profound enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
