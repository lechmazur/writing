<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to restore traditional systems is clear, but the hesitant swordsman’s personality feels underdeveloped; his awkwardness is mentioned but not deeply explored in action or dialogue, lacking a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between action and outcome is logical yet lacks tension, with some transitions feeling abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting of the tundra orchard with geothermal vents is vividly described with sensory detail, enhancing atmosphere and complementing the tone of ephemeral rancor; it strongly supports the story’s mood and concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through symbolism of shells and bridges, with layers of meaning in the postcard and hermit crabs; ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level, relying more on imagery than nuanced conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors like hermit crabs as scribes, avoiding clichés; however, some imagery feels ornate, bordering on purple prose, and emotional depth lacks subtle showing over telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the postcard and vents, leaving a lingering thought about change; yet, overly complex language occasionally hinders clarity, and brevity sometimes feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
