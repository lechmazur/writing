<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to outlive a prophecy via actors is intriguing but lacks depth; the twin's emotional stakes and personal voice feel underdeveloped amidst the surreal elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is ambitious with a clear arc, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between prophecy and actors as decoys are logical yet rushed, diminishing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with evocative imagery of the mountain peak and crystal shadows; sensory details enhance mood, though farmers market bustle feels slightly disconnected from the core setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling employs striking metaphors and symbolism (baseball, prophecy), creating some emotional resonance; however, the ending lacks full satisfaction, and dialogue, while poetic, feels overly cryptic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is present in the surreal premise and imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., "small moon") verge on clich√©; emotional nuance exists but is overshadowed by ornate language, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative integration of elements and leaves a lingering mystery; however, stylistic complexity sometimes hinders clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
