<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's apathy and laziness are distinct but inconsistently motivate actions; the summoner’s voice is unique in first-person narration but lacks depth in personal stakes beyond the task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between actions and concepts like river wisdom are imaginative yet sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with sensory details like salt and limestone scents; the dream studio setting enhances the surreal tone, though timeframe integration feels slightly detached.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Writing is original with fresh metaphors, avoiding clichés, but some ornate language borders on purple prose; emotional nuance exists but isn’t deeply felt, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought of resilience, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
