<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve a forbidden tale is clear and aligns with the dutiful scholar persona, but the internal conflict lacks deeper nuance; the first-person voice is distinct yet somewhat restrained, missing raw emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within constraints, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing is uneven—build-up to the vent transmission feels rushed, and cause-effect links are logical yet predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of a capsule hotel for time travelers is evocative and enhances the atmosphere of tension before a test; sensory details like vent echoes are strong, though some descriptions lack variety in texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes subtle emotion through the grandmother’s tale and uses effective imagery (e.g., “contraband sunlight”), but the central conflict’s resolution feels understated, lacking a sharper emotional punch; theme of memory versus policy is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with poetic metaphors, but some phrases (e.g., “unspoken heart”) border on clichéd; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet lacks surprising twists or truly fresh perspectives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering question about memory’s power, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; length feels deliberate but impact is moderate.</comment>
