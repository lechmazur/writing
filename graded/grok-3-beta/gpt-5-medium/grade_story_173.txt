<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map trade routes is clear, but the wandering orchardist's personality lacks depth beyond a vague stubbornness; first-person voice is present but not distinctive enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc feels somewhat complete with a beginning and resolution, but pacing is uneven, with rushed transitions between surreal imagery and action, disrupting coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Underwater city hall setting is vividly described with evocative sensory details like "old salt" and "ledger ink," enhancing the bittersweet tone and supporting the motivation, though timeframe integration feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and metaphor creates some emotional resonance, but the central conflict is subtle to a fault, lacking clear tension; ending feels purposeful but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining surreal elements with trade route mapping, but metaphors like "hope that could breathe longer" feel slightly overwrought; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but style sometimes veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
