<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; the tired swordsmanâ€™s apathy and defiance are intriguing but lack depth in motivation beyond vague promises. First-person voice is distinct but not fully realized in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between resignation and meteor-following lacks clarity in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the floating rock monastery is vivid and enhances atmosphere with evocative imagery; sensory details like kettles clicking stand out, though integration with character motivation could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling has emotional potential and strong metaphors (e.g., meteors stitching sky), but the central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the ending, while poignant, lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasional generic imagery and predictable introspection; while metaphors are often fresh, emotional depth sometimes feels stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story shows creative integration of elements and a lingering reflective tone, but cohesion suffers from unclear motivations and rushed pacing; style is promising but not yet polished for top-tier publication.</comment>
