<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing but incomplete; the cyber-templar’s “patiently frantic” nature is evocative, but motivations remain abstract, lacking depth in personal stakes or backstory within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is ambitious with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven; the climax of reflecting lightning is compelling, yet some transitions are abrupt, sacrificing coherence for poetic density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sky burial site is vividly realized with sensory details like bone towers and prayer flags; atmosphere strongly supports the tone of euphoric agitation, enhancing the surreal stakes of the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with striking imagery and symbolism (prism as truth, storm as challenge), but emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract dialogue and a resolution that feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique cyber-templar concept and surreal imagery, but some metaphors (e.g., “reality as a saddle”) feel forced, and emotional depth lacks nuance, leaning on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive and creatively ambitious, with elements woven thoughtfully, but its dense style occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate, missing deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
