<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve building traditions is clear and consistent, but the "sincere rebel" trait lacks depth in action and voice; reactions to fear feel stated rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, yet the theorizing action lacks stronger narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of the haunted passage is vividly rendered with sensory details like temperature changes and sounds; tone of bitterness enhances mood, though settingâ€™s connection to fear feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (ledger as memory, passage as history) evoke thought, but emotional resonance is uneven; conflict of tradition vs. modernity is clear, yet subtext lacks sharper layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some originality in combining guild history with ghostly elements, but metaphors like "braided bitterness" feel overused; emotional handling shows nuance at times, yet occasionally leans on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; lingering impact is present, though not as profound as top-tier work demands.</comment>
