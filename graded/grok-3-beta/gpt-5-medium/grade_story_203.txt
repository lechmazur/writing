<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing with the exorcist-stage fright dichotomy, shaping a unique voice in the first-person narration, but motivation feels slightly underdeveloped; the personal stakes of confronting lies could be clearer to align actions more powerfully with traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven—some transitions are abrupt, and the resolution, while poetic, lacks a fully grounded cause-effect connection to earlier tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "slow confetti" and enhances the atmosphere of isolation, complementing the defiant hush tone, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling craft shines with strong imagery and subtext around lies and inheritance, evoking thought, but emotional impact is somewhat muted by abstract language over concrete showing of feelings; the ending is purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is notable with fresh metaphors and a unique blend of sci-fi and personal haunting, avoiding clichés, though some emotional expressions lean toward stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity; style feels distinct overall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion despite numerous elements, with creative integration and a lingering sense of unresolved history, but overly poetic language occasionally obscures clarity, and the brevity feels more limiting than deliberate in fleshing out impact.</comment>
