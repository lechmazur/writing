<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is moderately effective; the lost apprentice's journey to self-acceptance is clear, but their voice feels inconsistent at times, wavering between poetic introspection and forced humor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven, with rushed emotional resolutions and overpacked imagery disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like magnetism-scented winds, enhancing atmosphere, though the tone occasionally overpowers character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Storytelling craft shows promise with strong metaphors and subtext about vulnerability, but the emotional impact is diluted by overwrought language and an ending that feels more clever than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by occasionally generic metaphors (e.g., galaxies as unpicked fruit) and a reliance on familiar sci-fi tropes, though the personal growth angle offers some unique perspective; prose borders on purple at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration, but the style often prioritizes flair over clarity, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a choice.</comment>
