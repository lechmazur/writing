<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The listless noble's naively sophisticated nature is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation to discover intention feels abstract and lacks grounding in personal stakes or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rendezvous drives the plot, but the arc feels more conceptual than complete; pacing is uneven with dense imagery slowing progression, though coherence is maintained within the surreal framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted corn maze and pre-sentience timeframe create a haunting, unique atmosphere; vivid sensory details like hissing corn and thunder-rehearsing sky immerse effectively, enhancing the tone of ironic awe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich imagery and metaphor (intention as loom) evoke thought, and subtext about choice is compelling; however, emotional resonance is muted by abstraction, and the ending feels more poetic than conclusive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal elements and fresh metaphors, but some phrases verge on purple prose; emotional depth is present but often stated rather than shown, risking formulaic undertones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration, but style sometimes obscures clarity; the brevity feels deliberate, and lingering questions about intention add depth, though impact is uneven.</comment>
