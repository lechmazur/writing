<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters, especially the necromancer, have distinct motivations (mapping echoes, freeing miners’ thoughts), but their personalities lack deeper texture beyond poetic descriptions; the first-person voice feels more atmospheric than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc exists with a clear beginning (exploration) and end (surfacing with resolve), but pacing feels uneven due to dense imagery overshadowing action; cause-effect links are present but often buried under metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (glimmering chambers, star fungus), enhancing the futuristic nostalgia tone and supporting the characters’ quest; atmosphere is a standout strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through layered imagery and themes of memory and loss, but emotional impact is muted by overwrought language; ending is purposeful but lacks raw resonance despite strong subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a necromancer mapping echoes is original, metaphors often feel forced or overly ornate (e.g., “crystalline static”); emotional nuance exists but is inconsistently shown rather than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but dense style hinders clarity; length feels deliberate yet overpacked with ideas, leaving a lingering mood but not a sharp takeaway.</comment>
