<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness and orphan background are present but underexplored; motivation to transform fear into courage feels stated rather than deeply felt or shown through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; gravitational anomaly drives the story but connections between actions and outcomes are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized with sensory details like drifting screws and humming air; atmosphere supports the mood of detachment and transformation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (stones as vows, moth as miracle) adds depth; emotional impact is present but undermined by overt statements of feeling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While imagery is often fresh, some metaphors (lighthouse smile) feel overused; emotional resonance is inconsistent, leaning on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought but lacks polished execution for top-tier publication.</comment>
