<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character as a professional cuddler is intriguing, with motivation to overcome prejudice somewhat clear, but their voice lacks distinctiveness in first-person narration, and reactions to the ticket punch feel more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within the word limit, with a coherent beginning and end, but pacing is uneven—introspective moments drag while key actions like the encounter feel rushed; logical flow is present but strained by over-symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned spaceport hangar is evocative with strong sensory details like iron and citrus, enhancing atmosphere, though the connection to the timeframe of the speech hush feels underexplored and slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through themes of grief and touch, with effective metaphors like the ticket punch as absence’s grammar, but the ending feels more intellectual than satisfying, and conflict resolution lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in combining cuddling with spaceport grief, but metaphors occasionally veer into purple prose, and emotional nuance sometimes feels stated rather than shown, risking predictability in thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering thought on absence and presence, but overly ornate style sometimes hinders clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
