<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to fuse ancient lore with modern dreams is clear and consistent, but the amiable nature feels underdeveloped in action and voice; the first-person narration lacks a distinct personal tone to fully convey amiability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from waiting room to lighthouse resolution feels complete within word limit, but pacing is uneven with overly dense introspection slowing momentum; logical flow is maintained, though cause and effect between actions and outcomes feels vague at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse signal room is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like salt-clogged brass and sea-curtained windows, enhancing atmosphere; tone of humble rebellion aligns well with setting, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on listening and patience through effective symbolism (crossword, lens), with subtext about balancing singularity and community; however, emotional impact is muted by over-explained themes rather than shown nuances, and ending lacks a sharp punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original imagery (crossword as sea chart) shows creativity, but some metaphors feel overwrought or generic (sea applauding); tone is consistent yet lacks distinct authorial style, and emotional resonance is stated more than felt, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres despite multiple elements, with creative integration of lighthouse and crossword; style occasionally hinders clarity with dense prose, and while it leaves a lingering thought on listening, overall impact falls short of exceptional depth or memorability.</comment>
