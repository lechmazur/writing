<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivo's nostalgic tailor persona is intriguing, with motivation to ascend beyond mortal limits showing some depth, but his reactions and actions lack consistent grounding in this nostalgia, feeling more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of reassurance driving some tension, but coherence falters with abstract transitions and unclear cause-effect links between parallel lives and ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck and atmosphere of hopeful desperation are vividly rendered with strong sensory details (steam, shuddering deck), enhancing the mood, though the setting’s connection to parallel lives feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Ivo’s desperation and uses rich imagery (mirror as ghost, stitching air), but the ending lacks full satisfaction, and the central conflict of ascent feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While metaphors like tailoring fate are fresh, the story leans on somewhat predictable steampunk tropes without subversion, and emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced subtext in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like confessions during storms, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
