<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with the bard's romantic doom and aversion to spotlight shaping actions, but motivation lacks depth beyond surface-level romance and preservation; voice is distinct yet occasionally overwritten.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure shows coherence within the word limit with a discernible arc, but pacing feels uneven; the concept of evading spotlight drives the narrative minimally, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>World and atmosphere are vividly drawn with evocative sensory details like echoes and bells; setting enhances tone of forgotten revelry, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with rich imagery and subtext, evoking thought on craft and restraint; however, emotional resonance is undercut by overwrought style, and conflict resolution feels understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in metaphor and concept integration, but some phrases border on purple prose; emotional handling shows nuance yet occasionally relies on explicit statements rather than pure showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is fair with creative element integration, but style sometimes hinders clarity; the story's brevity feels intentional yet lacks a fully lingering impact or depth beyond the narrative.</comment>
