<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's late-blooming heroism and softly militant resolve are intriguing, but motivation feels abstract and lacks grounding in personal stakes; the first-person voice is distinct but occasionally overwritten, obscuring emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at key moments like the raider confrontation; logical flow is maintained, though the desalination fix feels overly convenient within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic rooftop farm is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like "bathtub coffins" and "cracked paint buckets"; atmosphere of reluctant awe enhances the tone, though some setting-action connections feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection through imagery and themes of survival and balance; literary devices like "cathedral built from salvage" are striking, but the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional depth is more stated than shown at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with poetic metaphors, but some phrases verge on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally feels forced rather than nuanced; originality is present but tempered by familiar post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of hope; however, overly elaborate language sometimes hinders clarity, and the brief length feels slightly constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
