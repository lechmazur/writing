<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters, particularly the exiled prince, show glimmers of depth through motivation to cure loneliness, but their personalities lack distinct voices and nuanced development; interactions feel symbolic rather than grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between elements like the snowstorm and cure feels forced at times, lacking seamless cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative sensory details like the smell of wintergreen and the storm's pressure on the door; the abandoned customs office enhances the mood of isolation, though setting-character interplay could be deeper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on loneliness and connection through strong imagery and subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by overly ornate language; ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to underdeveloped conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with creative metaphors, but some imagery feels overused (e.g., storm as relative); emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies despite originality in concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally hinders clarity with dense phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought on loneliness, though the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
