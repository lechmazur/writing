<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a guilty swordswoman seeking release is clear, but depth is limited by vague backstory and minimal distinct voice in the first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between neon repair and the mask's riddle is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like rain, rust, and neon hum, effectively enhancing the mellow intensity, though setting integration with character action feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtext around guilt and release create impact, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly poetic language that sometimes obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in concept, but metaphors like "sleeping confession" feel overused, and emotional depiction leans toward stated rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally hinders clarity with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering question of justice, though not powerfully.</comment>
