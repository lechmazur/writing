<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing with the living statue's telepathy shaping a unique perspective, but motivation feels slightly abstract and lacks deeper personal stakes beyond the stated goal; the first-person voice is distinct yet occasionally over-stylized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure shows coherence with a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt, diminishing narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid with the steam-powered city square enhancing mood, supported by evocative sensory details; however, the toneâ€™s gloomy cheerfulness occasionally clashes with the gravity of revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Storytelling craft is strong with impactful imagery and subtext, evoking thought on truth and justice; yet, emotional resonance is undercut by overly poetic phrasing, and the ending feels slightly predictable despite its depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality is present with a unique protagonist and concept, but some metaphors feel overused, and emotional expression occasionally lacks nuance, leaning on stated feelings rather than shown reactions; style shows individuality yet borders on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought on truth; however, stylistic excess hinders clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
