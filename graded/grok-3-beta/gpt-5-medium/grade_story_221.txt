<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's melancholic yet rebellious nature is evident, and the motivation to step out of the father’s shadow is clear, but the wreck-diver ghost whisperer role feels underexplored in action and depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the letter and the shooting gallery event is somewhat tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like dust and cordite, enhancing the melancholic tone, though the timeframe of the half-written letter feels underutilized in atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering melancholic resonance, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity sometimes limits deeper exploration.</comment>
