<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's role as an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is intriguing, but motivation for liberation feels underdeveloped and lacks depth in personal stakes; first-person voice is distinct yet inconsistently revealing of inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; connections between ghost interactions and sand castle lab tasks are loose, disrupting coherence at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the sand castle preservation lab is evocative with strong sensory detail (humming air, glowing sand), enhancing the mood of complex simplicity; atmosphere supports ghostly encounters effectively, though timeframe integration is subtle to a fault.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a quiet melancholy and uses imagery (flower crown as halo) well; ending feels purposeful but not fully resonant; subtext about release is present but not deeply explored; conflict is small-scale yet lacks sharp tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors (elegantly clumsy heart), but some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, yet lacks nuance in ghostly interactions; originality is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of disparate elements; style supports clarity but occasionally veers into complexity that hinders impact; leaves a lingering thought about release, though depth feels slightly surface-level.</comment>
