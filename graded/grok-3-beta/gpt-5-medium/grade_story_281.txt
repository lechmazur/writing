<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's bafflement as a pickpocket is well-integrated with their internal conflict, and their motivation to escape yet repeatedly steal is compelling; however, their distinct voice occasionally wavers under heavy metaphor, diluting authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with transformation driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—initial setup drags while the resolution rushes, and coherence is strained by abrupt shifts in tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is vividly realized with sensory details like the engine’s cough and sea’s hiss, enhancing atmosphere and complementing the eerie tone, though timeframe integration feels incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on transformation through strong imagery and subtext, with a satisfying ending, but dialogue from the dummy feels overly philosophical, reducing naturalness; central conflict is present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, avoiding overt clichés, but some ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on explicit statement rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration and leaves a lingering thought on transformation, but style sometimes obscures clarity, and brief length feels slightly constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
