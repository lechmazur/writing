<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's role as a social media exorcist is intriguing, and the first-person voice is distinct, but motivation feels somewhat vague beyond "feeding curiosity," lacking deeper personal stakes or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; connections between actions and outcomes (like infiltrating clubs) are conceptually interesting yet lack clear causality, making the story feel slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with vivid sensory details (iron and oranges, silence ringing in teeth) enhancing the abandoned mess hall setting; tone of indifferent enthusiasm complements the haunting mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling is evocative with strong imagery and subtext (receipts as sheet music), prompting reflection, but emotional resonance is muted by the narratorâ€™s detachment; ending feels purposeful yet not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the concept of a social media exorcist and fresh metaphors, but some descriptors (e.g., "quietly loud") feel overused; emotional nuance exists but occasionally leans on stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering question about memory and grief; however, style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
