<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to master time is intriguing but underdeveloped; the "polite bandit" trait feels inconsistently applied, lacking depth in action and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the confrontation and resolution, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between harp, chip, and time mastery are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Electronic wilderness refuge and classroom hush create a unique, immersive atmosphere; sensory details like distorted notes enhance mood, though setting's full potential is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on time and stewardship via strong metaphors, but emotional resonance is limited by surface-level character reactions; ending is purposeful yet not fully impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh with moments of originality, but some metaphors (e.g., "syrupy instants") feel forced; tone is consistent, though emotional nuance is lacking in favor of stated ideas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but overly complex language occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of time's stewardship, though not powerfully.</comment>
