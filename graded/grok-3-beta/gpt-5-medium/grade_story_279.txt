<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map weather patterns is clear and consistent, but the "tactically reckless" attribute feels underexplored in depth, lacking nuanced personal conflict or growth beyond risk-taking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels somewhat complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven; the action of razing is more metaphorical than concrete, weakening cause-effect clarity and narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting of the giant's book library is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the electric peace tone and supporting the concept of gradience, though timeframe integration feels secondary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with creative flair, but overly complex style sometimes obscures clarity; leaves a lingering thought of adaptation, though length feels slightly restrictive to full depth.</comment>
