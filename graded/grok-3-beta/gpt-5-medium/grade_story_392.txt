<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's skepticism shapes their voice and actions, but motivation to archive storm sounds feels somewhat abstract and underexplored within the personal context; the first-person narration has a distinct tone, though deeper emotional grounding is needed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a poetic resolution, but pacing feels uneven due to dense imagery; connections between actions and outcomes are present but occasionally obscured by metaphorical overload.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like "loud silence" and storm sounds; the star chart reading room enhances the mood, though its integration with character motivation could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through layered metaphors and partings as a theme; imagery is striking, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract language rather than concrete showing of feelings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality with fresh metaphors and a unique perspective on loss and memory; however, some phrases feel overly ornate, bordering on purple prose, and emotional nuance could be more humanized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering melancholic impression; style supports the mood but occasionally hinders clarity with dense language; brevity feels intentional but slightly restrictive.</comment>
