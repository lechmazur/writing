<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict as an unconvinced missionary is palpable, but motivation lacks depth beyond surface disillusionment; first-person voice is distinct yet sometimes overwrought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; the action of decoding patterns drives the story but pacing is uneven within the word limit, with rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass desert setting is vividly realized with striking sensory details like ringing dunes; atmosphere powerfully supports the tone of isolation and tested faith.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes introspection through imagery and subtext, with strong metaphors; ending is purposeful but central conflict lacks sharper resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in metaphor (e.g., chapel bell stuffed with moths), but some phrases feel ornate; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style sometimes hinders clarity with dense imagery; leaves a lingering thought, though not fully polished for top-tier publication.</comment>
