<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to reclaim lost family recipes is clear and drives the narrative, but the broke aristocrat's personality lacks depth beyond the surface struggle; first-person voice is distinct yet occasionally overwritten, missing raw emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a haunting quest and resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the connection between walking and ghostly interaction is logical yet underexplored, leading to minor coherence gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park setting is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details like peeling roses and salt tasting like coins, strongly supporting the eerie tone and legacy theme; atmosphere enhances motivation but occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story evokes melancholy and reflection through imagery and subtext of lost legacy, with strong metaphors like the kitchen in the sky; however, the ending feels slightly abrupt, and emotional depth is shown but not fully sustained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While imagery is often fresh, some metaphors (e.g., hunger like a tailored scarf) feel forced or overly ornate; the narrative has originality in concept but leans on gothic tropes without enough subversion, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like legacy and recipes, leaving a lingering sense of burden and resolution; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brevity feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
