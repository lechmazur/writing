<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation of correcting a life's regret is clear and drives the narrative, but the fireworks designer attribute feels underexplored in shaping personality beyond surface creativity; first-person voice is distinct yet lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though connections between regret and resolution via frost patterns are tenuous and abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted with evocative sensory details like frost patterns and waterfall imagery, enhancing the mood of regret and repair; setting supports motivation, though timeframe integration feels abstract and less grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (frost as braille, sparks as apologies) evokes thought, but emotional resonance is somewhat stated rather than shown; ending is satisfying, yet central conflict resolution feels slightly pat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh, but some phrasing (e.g., "shy mathematics of repair") borders on purple prose; emotional handling shows nuance in subtext, yet overall narrative tone shifts slightly, risking predictability in regret trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of reconciliation; however, style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
