<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character as unseen observer is intriguing, but motivation feels abstract and lacks personal depth; the "aggressively kind" attribute is mentioned but not deeply explored through specific actions or internal conflict, resulting in a somewhat distant voice despite first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves a sense of completeness with a clear beginning, middle, and end within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between the whistle and the stage rising could be more logically grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse watch room is vividly realized with sensory details like "sea wheezing through cracked panes," enhancing the atmosphere of mystery and melancholy; the setting powerfully supports the tone and characterâ€™s mission, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a haunting emotional response through imagery and subtext of memory and loss; metaphors like "tongue of memory" are striking, though the central conflict remains somewhat ethereal, lacking sharp resolution within the tight narrative space.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality with fresh metaphors and a unique perspective on tradition, but some phrases border on overwrought, risking purple prose; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the whistle and whale call, leaving a lingering sense of nostalgia; however, the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
