<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character as an insomniac poet is distinct with a unique voice, but motivation feels slightly abstract; the drive for non-violence lacks deeper personal grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; the transition between attic and subway lacks clarity, and pacing is uneven within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally obscures clarity; leaves a lingering thought, though not powerfully so.</comment>
