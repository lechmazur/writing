<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's jadedness and strange habits are intriguing, but motivation feels vague beyond a generic desire to understand the past; lacks deeper personal stakes or distinct voice in first-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of globalizing driving tension, but coherence suffers from abrupt shifts between literal and metaphorical elements, leaving cause and effect murky.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crystal lab setting and pre-fireworks stillness create a striking atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details like humming crystals and aching windows; tone of desperation complements concept, though setting’s connection to action feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through layered metaphors and a haunting ending, with strong imagery (memory seeping through steel); however, central conflict lacks clarity, and emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract language over concrete showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality with unique metaphors and a surreal approach, avoiding clichés, but some phrases feel overly ornate, bordering on purple prose; emotional resonance is present but not fully nuanced, occasionally stating rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, style occasionally hinders clarity with overly complex imagery, and brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
