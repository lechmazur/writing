<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's determined outlaw nature and wistful pragmatism are evident in actions and voice, but motivation feels slightly abstract, lacking deeper personal stakes beyond discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with browsing and paint-smudge matching driving discovery, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the resolution lacks a stronger emotional or narrative anchor within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient Roman marketplace is vividly rendered with sensory details and complements the tone of earnest mockery, though the connection between setting and hidden power source feels slightly tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but some ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional nuance is present yet not deeply felt, slightly diminishing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but style occasionally overshadows clarity; it leaves a lingering curiosity about the power source, though depth feels constrained by length.</comment>
