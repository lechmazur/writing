<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation as a loyal scout is clear and drives the narrative, but the personality lacks depth beyond duty; the first-person voice is distinct yet underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with the lookout role and coded messages, but pacing feels rushed within the word limit, and connections between meditation and action are somewhat forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of sanctified dread is evocative, with strong sensory details like flickering lights and moths, but the tower setting's connection to the broader city feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors (moths as meditation guides) are striking and evoke thought, but emotional resonance is inconsistent, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors are fresh, the narrative leans on somewhat predictable dystopian tropes without subversion; emotional handling shows nuance but occasionally states rather than shows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with dense imagery, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks deeper impact.</comment>
