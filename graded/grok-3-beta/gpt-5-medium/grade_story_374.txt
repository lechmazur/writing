<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lonesome minstrel's personality is distinct and shaped by solitude and cosmic curiosity, with a clear motivation to read the silent cosmos.

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with cloud-tracking driving a subtle resolution toward truce.

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The futuristic rooftop horse stables are vividly rendered with sensory details like chrome mares and ion rain, enhancing the mundane enchantment tone. Yet, the connection between setting and character motivation feels under-explored, missing a deeper atmospheric resonance with the cosmos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes quiet reflection through poetic imagery and the unclear stamp's symbolism, with a satisfying, open-ended close. However, the central conflict of rivalries is introduced but not fully explored, and dialogue, while natural, lacks punch to elevate emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending futuristic elements with poetic cloud-tracking, avoiding most clichés through fresh metaphors.

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the stamp and cloud patterns, leaving a lingering sense of quiet truce.
