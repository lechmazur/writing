<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is adequate, with the diplomat’s confusion and "boldly timid" nature reflected in their hesitance and eventual action, but the inner conflict lacks deeper nuance or specificity in voice, feeling somewhat generic for a first-person narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from confusion to resolution within the word limit, driven by the act of liberalizing access, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the council decision, missing finer emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The eerie salt mine village is vividly realized with strong sensory details (salt-bright rhythm, miners’ songs), enhancing the atmosphere and complementing the joyfully tragic tone, though some connections between setting and action feel slightly overstated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with evocative imagery (swifts as calligraphy, salt and wing wisdom) and a clear theme of resilience through openness, but the ending lacks a sharper emotional punch, and some subtext feels heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique setting and metaphors (patterns in flocks, salt-bright rhythm), but some phrases verge on purple prose, and emotional resonance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than shown nuance, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story coheres despite numerous elements, with creative integration of setting and theme, but stylistic overreach and rushed emotional resolution hinder publishability in a top-tier venue without refinement.</comment>
