<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's "tuneless bard" identity and fierce nonchalance shape a unique voice, but motivation to "kiss the horizon of madness" feels abstract and underdeveloped, lacking deeper personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot arc feels incomplete with a weak central conflict; pacing is uneven, rushed at the end, though the concept of taming chaos loosely ties beginning to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Steampunk airship dining room is vividly realized with sensory details like wheezing valves and pulsing chandeliers, strongly supporting atmosphere and tone, though timeframe integration feels incidental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; lingering impact is present but muted by unclear stakes.</comment>
