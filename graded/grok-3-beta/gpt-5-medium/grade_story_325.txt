<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Mael's portrayal as a mad botanist is intriguing, with carnivorous plants reflecting her eccentricities, but her motivations lack depth beyond the quest for ancient pathways; her comically serious trait feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the action of ionizing film to reveal maps, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations and some logical gaps in the method's plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The high altitude tea house setting is evocative, with sensory details like ionized steam and thunderous tea enhancing atmosphere; however, the timeframe of intermission feels underutilized in grounding the mood.</comment>
