<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is distinct with a stoic yet subversive nature, and motivation to defy conformity is clear; however, deeper emotional nuance or internal conflict is underexplored, limiting the steward’s complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot has a subtle arc with a sense of routine disrupted by quiet rebellion, but pacing feels slightly uneven, and the central action of curating doesn’t fully drive a transformative resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like apples and dust, and the miniature world museum enhances the theme of hidden truths; however, the orchard setting feels slightly underutilized in relation to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes quiet reflection on authenticity and rebellion through strong imagery and subtext, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of sharper conflict or a more resonant ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of quiet defiance; yet, the style sometimes prioritizes poetic flourish over clarity, and the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
