<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to save the sister is clear and drives the narrative, but the overburdened clerk persona lacks depth or distinct voice beyond a functional role; reactions to stamps and pressure feel more conceptual than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (promise to sister), middle (discovery via stamps), and end (potential cure), but pacing feels uneven with rushed transitions between surreal elements and abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The undersea greenhouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (glass, fathoms, sonar-like heartbeat), enhancing the dissonant calm tone and supporting the concept of weaving worlds; atmosphere strongly complements the motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through layered metaphors (stamps as vaccines, weaving worlds), but emotional impact is undercut by overly abstract language; ending is purposeful yet lacks visceral resonance; central conflict is present but not fully felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in the surreal blending of stamps and science, but some metaphors (e.g., "dissonant calm gathers like silt") feel ornate and overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking formulaic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, but overly complex style sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering thought of relativity, though not strongly emotive.</comment>
