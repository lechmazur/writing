<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness and brokenness are evident, shaping actions and motivations, but the depth of personality feels surface-level; lacks a distinct voice or nuanced internal conflict beyond stated traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven—moments of introspection slow the narrative unnecessarily, and cause-effect links are sometimes vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with evocative snow and gallery imagery enhancing mood; sensory details are vivid, though the connection between setting and character motivation could be more explicitly tied to nature’s solace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through symbolism of power and refusal, with strong imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by overt telling over showing; ending feels purposeful yet lacks a sharp, lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor and setting, but reliance on familiar traveler-seeking-meaning trope without subversion; language occasionally veers into purple prose, detracting from clarity and authenticity of emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is present with elements woven into a unified narrative, but style sometimes overshadows clarity; story length feels deliberate, yet lacks a deeply lingering question or feeling post-reading.</comment>
