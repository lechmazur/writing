<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from quest to discovery, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a deeper resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly crafted with evocative sensory details like “glass organs chiming” and “shifting sands,” powerfully enhancing the mood and supporting the concept of time and change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storytelling is impactful with strong imagery and thematic depth around adaptation and compassion, though the lack of dialogue limits character voice, and the ending feels slightly abrupt despite its purposefulness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique blend of elements and poetic style, but some metaphors like “dandelion clocks” feel overused, and emotional nuance occasionally leans toward stated rather than shown.</comment>
