<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to break shame's walls is clear and drives the narrative, but the sleep-deprived inventor lacks depth beyond this singular focus; first-person voice is distinct yet underdeveloped in personal history or nuanced emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves a sense of arc with the orchard’s transformation, but pacing feels uneven—early sections drag with abstraction, while the resolution rushes; cause and effect are logical, though coherence suffers from overly dense imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Neon orchard and cyberpunk underworld create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory detail; tone of subtle passion complements the setting, though some descriptions risk overwriting the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on shame and belonging with potent symbolism (orchard, bell), and the ending feels purposeful; however, central conflict lacks sharp focus, and subtext occasionally overreaches into opacity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original imagery (circuitry apples, dna strands) shines, but some metaphors feel forced or overly ornate; emotional resonance is present but uneven, with stated feelings occasionally overtaking shown nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, leaving a lingering question on listening as invention; style supports depth but risks clarity with dense prose; length feels deliberate yet slightly overpacked.</comment>
