<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is intriguing but incomplete; the "morbid florist" concept and "neutrally passionate" attribute shape a unique voice, but motivation feels abstract and reactions lack deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the action to "oblige" via typed pages, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the cosmic and funerary tone, though the timeframe's integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storytelling impact is strong with layered metaphors and cosmic imagery, evoking reflection, though the emotional resonance is tempered by a lack of raw, shown emotion; the ending is satisfying but not unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in the unique blend of floristry and cosmic cycles, with fresh metaphors, but some phrasing verges on purple prose, and emotional handling occasionally feels stated rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Overall, the story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of awe, but style sometimes overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
