<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters, particularly the cynical conjurer, have a distinct voice and motivation to harness the ephemeral, but their humbly arrogant attribute feels underexplored in action and reaction, lacking deeper personal conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a poetic arc with shared isolation as a concept, but lacks a clear causal progression or central conflict; pacing feels meandering rather than deliberate within the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and metaphor evokes reflection on memory and loss, but the emotional impact is diluted by abstract language over concrete conflict; the ending feels more ambiguous than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective through poetic prose, some metaphors feel overwrought or generic, and emotional resonance leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative interplay of elements like the lighthouse and shared isolation, but overly ornate style sometimes obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering mood but lacks sharp focus.</comment>
