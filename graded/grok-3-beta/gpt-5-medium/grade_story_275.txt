<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear and tender, driving actions consistently, but the hermit’s personality lacks deeper nuance beyond poetic stoicism; first-person voice is distinct yet overly introspective, limiting emotional range.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within the word limit with a subtle resolution, but pacing is uneven—early introspection slows momentum while the ending rushes neighbor interaction; cause and effect are logical, though coherence frays with abstract tangents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked with striking sensory details (comet’s hiss, trees like thin-boned horses), and the ghostly orchard enhances the tone of deliberate wilderness; setting supports motivation well, though timeframe integration feels slightly vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (furrows filled with waiting) create emotional resonance and subtext about patience, but the ending lacks punch; theme of mindful choices emerges clearly, though emotional depth is shown more than felt, slightly muting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in unique metaphors and setting, avoiding clichés, but some language (e.g., “grief learning a new grammar”) veers into purple prose; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly serving the narrative, and creative thinking is evident in imagery; however, overly ornate style hinders clarity at times, and lingering impact is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
