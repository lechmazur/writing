<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to personal tragedy is compelling, and the orchardist background informs their analytical approach, but the emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped due to the word limit, missing raw vulnerability in the first-person voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from investigation to confrontation is clear, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between personal tragedy and conspiracy unravels too neatly, lacking nuanced cause-effect depth within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The paper airplane test facility is vividly rendered with sensory details like glue and graphite, enhancing the sardonic tone, though the atmosphere occasionally overshadows character emotion, slightly diluting the personal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (pruning lies, peacock patterns) adds subtext, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional impact is muted by overreliance on clever imagery over raw feeling; central conflict resolves too abruptly for lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh (pruners clicking, gliders ticking like rain), and the perspective is unique, but some phrases feel ornate ("fury deserved fertilizer"), verging on purple prose, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the style supports the sardonic tone, but the brief length limits emotional depth, and the lingering impact is intellectual rather than visceral, missing a profound afterthought.</comment>
