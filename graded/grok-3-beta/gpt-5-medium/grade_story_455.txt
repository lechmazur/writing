<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to out-face ghostly judgments is clear, and the disgruntled nature fits the role, but the personality lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice beyond surface cynicism; internal conflict feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the action of corroborating the route drives the story, yet some cause-effect links (like the chamber’s response) feel convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of inherited mystery is vivid with evocative sensory details like cooling stones and lantern shadows, strongly supporting the setting and tone; however, the connection between setting and character motivation could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through subtext of duty and legacy, with strong imagery (coins as a choir), but the ending feels more conclusive than hauntingly purposeful; conflict resolution lacks a sharp emotional punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in metaphor (rope swaying inside ribs), avoiding most clichés, but some phrases like “weight of scars” feel generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with creative element integration, leaving a lingering sense of duty, but style sometimes overcomplicates clarity with ornate language; brevity feels deliberate yet limits deeper exploration of themes.</comment>
