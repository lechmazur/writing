<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity as a cartographer is intriguing and drives unique actions like mapping with plum ink, but motivation feels vague at times, lacking deeper emotional grounding despite the first-person voice's distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains a loose arc with seasonal redrawing and storm response, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; cause and effect are present but not always impactful or tightly connected.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The urban orchard and solar panels create a vivid, contrasting setting that enhances the tone of grit and innovation, with strong sensory details like fractured light, though atmosphere occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through metaphors of maps as promises, with subtext about leadership, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract language; ending is purposeful but lacks a sharp, lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Writing shows originality with fresh imagery like ink from fallen plums, avoiding clich√©s, though some metaphors feel slightly forced; tone is consistent, but emotional nuance could be deeper rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally veers into overly ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea of revision, yet depth feels constrained by abstraction.</comment>
