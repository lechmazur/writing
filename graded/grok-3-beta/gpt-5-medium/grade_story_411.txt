<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character as a sentient car mechanic is intriguing, but motivation to hear confessions feels underdeveloped and not fully aligned with mechanical traits; first-person voice is distinct but lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but feels fragmented; connections between actions and concepts are imaginative yet lack logical grounding, with pacing uneven and rushed at critical moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Subterranean orchard and river of stars create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances tone, but sensory details are inconsistently specific, and setting's connection to character motivation is tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought through metaphor and imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by overwritten passages; ending is purposeful yet lacks resonance, and conflict resolution feels abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Originality is present in concept, but execution relies on overused metaphors and ornate language; emotional handling is more stated than shown, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story shows creative integration of elements, but cohesion suffers from stylistic excess; length feels like a limitation rather than a choice, and lingering impact is undermined by lack of clarity.</comment>
