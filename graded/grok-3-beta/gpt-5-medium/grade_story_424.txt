<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character as a "mild zealot" is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation for auditing equations lacks depth, and personal stakes feel vague despite first-person voice showing hints of personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc feels loosely complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven; the connection between visualizing the attractor and the ending's sacrifice feels forced, disrupting logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting of the strange attractor laboratory is vividly described with sensory details like cedar eaves and machine patina, strongly supporting rustic refinement tone and enhancing atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others feel ornate and overworked; emotional resonance is inconsistent, relying on stated insights over nuanced showing, and tone shifts slightly at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering question about sacrifice, though depth feels surface-level.</comment>
