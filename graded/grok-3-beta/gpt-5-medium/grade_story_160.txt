<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to defy finality is clear, but the watchman’s personality feels underdeveloped; lacks a distinct voice or deeper emotional nuance beyond stoic determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels uneven; some moments linger too long on imagery, disrupting momentum within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked with sensory details like “cold iron, stale oil,” enhancing the mood of prickly wonder; setting supports action well, though timeframe integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (airship as defiance of endings) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by lack of personal stakes; ending feels purposeful yet not fully resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in metaphor (e.g., “endings are spoor, not walls”), but reliance on abstract language and generic descriptors like “old storms” dulls uniqueness; tone is consistent but not strikingly fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering idea of renewal, though not powerfully so.</comment>
