<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to triumph over despair is clear and aligns with the collector persona, but the distinct voice and depth of personality are somewhat muted by overly poetic introspection, lacking raw emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from invitation to resolution is coherent within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with dense metaphor slowing the middle, and the connection between action and concept is more stylistic than structural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frost giant's lair is vividly rendered with icicle balconies and cold theater imagery, enhancing atmosphere, though sensory details occasionally feel ornamental rather than integral to character or plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (rose as survival, board game as struggle) creates layers, but emotional impact is diluted by overt explanation rather than showing, and the ending feels more clever than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original in concept with fresh metaphors like "despair as a white bear," but some phrases verge on purple prose, and emotional handling leans toward stated rather than nuanced, risking a formulaic undertone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements, with creative integration, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate, lacking a lingering depth beyond surface triumph.</comment>
