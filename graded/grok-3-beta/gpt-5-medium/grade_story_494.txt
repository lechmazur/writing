<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development shows potential, with the swordsman’s arrogance and doubt subtly shifting through interaction, but motivation feels slightly forced—his drive to "relight" lacks deeper personal grounding beyond the tapestry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but uneven; the shift from duel request to song feels abrupt, though the resolution ties back to the beginning. Pacing is tight but sacrifices clarity for poetic density within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like cicadas and ripples, enhancing mood and setting, though the courtyard’s connection to the broader conflict feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes reflection through symbolism (water, cranes), and the ending carries weight, but dialogue occasionally feels overwrought, diminishing naturalness and impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While metaphors are often fresh, some imagery borders on purple prose, and the narrative leans on familiar master-student tropes without fully subverting them, reducing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is fair despite dense style; elements serve the story, but complexity sometimes obscures clarity. The lingering effect is present but not striking enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
