<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The meek necromancer's sincerity shapes his gentle interactions, and his motivation to decode a universal riddle is clear, but his deeper personality lacks texture beyond these traits, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, with the riddle-solving driving progression, but pacing is uneven, and some connections, like the dew drop method, feel more poetic than logically integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is vividly realized with sensory details like playground sounds, enhancing the mystic tone, though the setting's connection to the dew drop feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance and uses imagery effectively, with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict is understated, and the theme of kindness feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining elements like the broken pen and dew drop, with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, slightly detracting from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
