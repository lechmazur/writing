<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marla's portrayal as an unsure champion with rational rebellion is clear, and her motivation to preserve cultural practices is consistent, but her emotional depth regarding Eban feels underdeveloped, lacking nuanced inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the festival as a central action driving cohesion, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution with Eban, weakening cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chalk cliff artist colony and church bells timeframe are vividly rendered with sensory details like gulls and sea spray, enhancing the cheerful gloom tone, though the setting occasionally overshadows character motives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (amber brooch as tide clock) add depth, and the theme of imperfect love emerges, but emotional resonance is muted by telling over showing, and the ending lacks a fully satisfying punch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with assigned elements, showing creative intent, but overly elaborate style occasionally hinders clarity, and the short length feels somewhat constrained rather than deliberate.</comment>
