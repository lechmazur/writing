<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to right a historical wrong is clear and tied to family legacy, but the "consistently whimsical" trait feels slightly forced in execution, lacking depth in shaping reactions beyond surface-level curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit; tracking shooting stars as a method drives the narrative uniquely, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting of the ruined fortress over a waterfall is vividly described with strong sensory details (roaring water, petrichor), enhancing the restless harmony tone and supporting the character's quest, though timeframe integration feels slightly incidental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional resonance through the theme of inherited longing, with effective imagery (stars as critics, waterfall as drummer); ending is satisfying, but subtext on broader societal impact remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining stars and music, with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language ("glittering curiosity") veers toward purple prose, and emotional depth sometimes relies on telling rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of restored justice; style supports clarity, but brief length slightly constrains deeper exploration of themes and character nuance.</comment>
