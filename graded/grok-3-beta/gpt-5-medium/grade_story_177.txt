<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's rebellious nature and role as a traveler writing obituaries for the living are intriguing and consistent, shaping their actions and motivations. However, the first-person voice, while distinct, lacks deeper emotional nuance or personal history to fully ground the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from discovery to action against censors. Pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links (e.g., giantâ€™s sudden awakening) are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details (papercuts, prophecy, dust) that enhance the atmosphere of lucid frenzy. The setting-action synergy is strong, though the timeframe of revolution feels underexplored in the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its concept of living obituaries as augury, with rich symbolism (mask, labyrinth) and a satisfying ending. However, the central conflict with censors lacks depth, and some imagery borders on overwrought, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in concept and metaphor (e.g., obituaries as lockpicks), but some phrases feel ornate rather than purposeful, veering into purple prose. Emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown, lacking subtle nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, and the brief length suits the surreal tone. It leaves a lingering idea of rewriting fate, but overly complex language occasionally obscures clarity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
