<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's seasickness and awkward charm are distinctive and shape a unique voice, but motivation to confront the mirror feels vague at times, lacking deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven; the transformation action drives the story, yet some causal links between mirror confrontation and resolution are tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting of the crystal fortress and rainbow canyon is vividly realized with evocative sensory details; atmosphere supports nostalgic defiance, though timeframe integration feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (mirror, bulb) create layers of meaning, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is inconsistent, with some 'telling' over 'showing' in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Writing shows individual style with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, and some emotional depictions lack nuanced subtext, feeling stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, and brevity seems deliberate, but style occasionally hinders clarity with overcomplex phrasing; lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
