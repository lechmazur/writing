<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to banish doubt is clear, and the shift from city planner to doomsday prepper informs actions, but the first-person voice lacks distinctiveness and depth; internal conflict feels stated rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc achieves completeness with a resolution, but pacing feels uneven within the word limit; the handshake as a pivotal action drives tension, though connections between elements like constellations and sluices feel forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ancient Indian temple setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like monsoon surges and hissing torches, enhancing mood, though the timeframeâ€™s specificity feels underexplored in relation to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ink blotter as oath-keeper, broken constellations as refusal) adds depth, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance relies too much on telling over showing; central theme of integrity is clear but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors (chains, constellations) are fresh, but others feel ornate; tone is consistent, yet emotional handling lacks nuance, leaning on explicit statements; originality is present in concept but not fully realized in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the ink blotter, but style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; length feels deliberate, though depth is somewhat surface-level, leaving only moderate lingering impact.</comment>
