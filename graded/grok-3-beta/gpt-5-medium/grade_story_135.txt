<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to document dying dialects is clear, but the ambitious brewer's personality lacks depth beyond the mission; first-person voice is distinct but underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc feels complete within the word limit with a clear beginning and resolution, though pacing is unevenâ€”some metaphors slow momentum while key actions like deciphering the poster feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked with sensory details of ice, frost, and mechanical sounds; the frozen harbor enhances the tone of preservation against loss, though some setting elements feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., "white roar of forgetting") creates impact and subtext about memory; ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level due to limited character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphors and the concept of brewing memory, but some phrases feel overly ornate; emotional handling is more shown than told, yet lacks the raw human nuance expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but style occasionally veers into overcomplexity, hindering clarity; leaves a lingering thought about loss, though not as deeply as top-tier work demands.</comment>
