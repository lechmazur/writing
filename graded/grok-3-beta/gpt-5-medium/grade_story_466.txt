<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's cunning and morally ambiguous nature are evident, but motivation feels vague and inconsistently tied to actions; the first-person voice is distinct but lacks depth in revealing inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc, but pacing feels rushed, and cause-effect links between decoding and town impact are tenuous; coherence suffers from abrupt shifts in focus within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details like "singed thyme" and "burned rosemary," enhancing mood; however, the grocery setting and tower connection feels underexplored and slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (smoke as language, tower as library) add depth, and the ending prompts thought; yet, emotional impact is diluted by over-telling and insufficient conflict resolution within word constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "peaches rolling like small suns" are fresh, and style shows individuality; however, some ornate phrasing borders on purple prose, and emotional nuance is inconsistently shown rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves moderate cohesion with creative element integration, but style occasionally obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering question, though not a deeply resonant one, given the execution flaws.</comment>
