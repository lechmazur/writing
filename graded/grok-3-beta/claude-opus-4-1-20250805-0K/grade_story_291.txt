<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Vega's motivation to defy prejudice is clear, and her daring nature shapes her actions in the maze, but her personality lacks deeper nuance or a distinct voice beyond the archetype of a rebellious captain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the confrontation, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the cosmic echoes as a method sometimes disrupt narrative coherence with abrupt shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park mirror maze is vividly rendered and enhances the cosmic echoes, supporting the tone of calculated wilderness, though sensory details are uneven and the orchard cat timeframe feels disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Vega's defiance and uses symbolism with the rope effectively, but the dialogue feels stilted, and subtext about prejudice, while present, lacks deeper exploration within the limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of cosmic echoes offers originality, some metaphors (e.g., "internal compass") feel generic, and emotional resonance is more stated than shown, slightly undermining authenticity despite a unique setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the maze and rope, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>
