<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's politeness and banditry are intriguing, but his motivations feel underdeveloped; the shift from loyal servant to rogue lacks emotional depth or specific catalysts beyond a generic betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with time mastery as the goal, and pacing is managed decently within the word limit, but cause-effect links, especially around the harp's role, feel convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The electronic wilderness refuge is vividly imagined with strong sensory detail (crystalline trees, distorted notes), enhancing the atmosphere, though the classroom setting feels underutilized and disconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story evokes some thought on betrayal and control, with decent imagery, but the emotional impact is muted by 'telling' over 'showing'; the ending feels purposeful yet lacks a deeper resonance or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a digital forest and temporal harp is original, some metaphors (e.g., "digital trees") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but not fully convincing, leaning on stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a mild lingering impression.</comment>
