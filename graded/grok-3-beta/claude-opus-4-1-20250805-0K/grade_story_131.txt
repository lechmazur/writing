<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's portrayal as an aloof orphan is compelling, and her motivation to adapt or perish is clear, but her emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking a fully distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, driven by the anomaly and stones, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration of key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting is vividly realized with evocative details like floating objects and warped metal, enhancing the atmosphere of isolation, though sensory variety beyond sight and sound is limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through Maya’s transformation and uses strong symbolism with the stones, but the ending, while purposeful, lacks a final punch to make it truly unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in blending personal trauma with a sci-fi anomaly, but some metaphors (e.g., “anchors”) feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on telling over showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overall, the story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the stones and anomaly, leaving a lingering thought about letting go, though stylistic depth and clarity could be sharper for top-tier publication.</comment>
