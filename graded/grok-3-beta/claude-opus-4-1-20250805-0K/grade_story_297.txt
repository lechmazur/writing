<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, driven by the tattooing action, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration of Thanul's reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lava flow coffee shop setting is vividly realized with sensory detail and enhances the mystical tone, though the timeframe's impact feels underexplored beyond a poetic flourish.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, slightly hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering idea but not a profound impact.</comment>
