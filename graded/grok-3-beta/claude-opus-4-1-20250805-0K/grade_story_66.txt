<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vera's motivation as a deserter fleeing violence is clear and consistent, shaping her transformation into a nurturer, though her internal conflict lacks deeper nuance or distinct voice beyond the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from deserter to gardener feels complete within the word limit, but pacing is uneven with dense exposition slowing the middle; cause and effect are logical, yet the action of reconstructing stories doesn't fully drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting of the botanical station is evocative and deeply tied to the concept of plant communication, enhancing atmosphere with sensory details like "chemical songs of orchids," though some tonal shifts feel slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on cycles of trauma with strong symbolism (carbon into diamonds), but the ending feels slightly predictable, and emotional depth is more told than shown, missing raw subtext in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the premise of plant memory is original, some metaphors (e.g., "scattered pieces") feel overused, and emotional handling leans toward stated feelings rather than nuanced showing, risking generic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative integration, leaving a lingering thought on belonging, but stylistic density occasionally hinders clarity, and the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
