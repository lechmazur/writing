<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct, with Marcus’s bluffing nature and energetic lethargy informing his predatory attention, but motivations feel slightly surface-level; deeper internal conflict or backstory is needed for true depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear within the word limit, with a logical beginning and end, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the dropped book method, while clever, borders on contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reclaimed orchard in a toppled skyscraper is vividly rendered with evocative sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere of nature’s defiance, though the tone’s gentle harshness occasionally wavers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (apple blossoms, price tag as truth) create subtext, and the ending is purposeful, but emotional resonance is somewhat undercut by overt dialogue; more showing needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and concept are original, some metaphors (dying moths) feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is present but not fully developed; risks predictability in character archetypes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering sense of justice, but lacks the polish and depth for top-tier impact; style is clear but not striking enough for elite publication.</comment>
