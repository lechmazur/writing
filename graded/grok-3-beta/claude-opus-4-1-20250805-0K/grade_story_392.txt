<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meridian's skepticism shapes her initial dismissal of conjuring arts, but her transformation feels slightly abrupt given the short length; motivation to archive storm sounds is clear, though her shift to belief in magic lacks deeper grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc from skepticism to belief is present but feels rushed within the word limit; categorizing memories drives the story, yet the connection between storm sounds and farewells emerges too suddenly to fully cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Star chart reading room and post-Upload timeframe create a unique atmosphere; sensory details like "loud silence" and humming thimbles are evocative, though some connections between setting and action feel symbolic rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes thought on loss and memory with strong metaphors like "heartbreak" as sensation; ending is purposeful but not fully earned emotionally; subtext of humanity's departure is present but could be shown more subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Concept of digitized memories and storm sounds is original, but reliance on familiar sci-fi tropes of "Great Upload" without subversion limits freshness; metaphors are creative yet occasionally over-explained, reducing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with assigned elements mostly in service of narrative, though pacing issues hinder clarity; creative combination of memory and storm sounds leaves a lingering thought, but overall depth falls short of top-tier impact.</comment>
