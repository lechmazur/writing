<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mordecai’s grumpiness is evident, and his trauma-driven motivation is clear, but his emotional transformation feels slightly abrupt given the word limit; deeper internal conflict or voice could elevate his portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a poignant resolution, and the action of pouring ashes drives the narrative forward, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing some emotional build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The witch’s scrying room and stargazing timeframe create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with evocative sensory details like starlight and crystal refractions; the setting strongly supports the mood and concept of trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through symbolism (ashes, mandala) and subtext of reconciliation; the ending is satisfying, but dialogue feels sparse and could add depth to character interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique perspective on trauma via the mandala, some metaphors (e.g., “moonlight through stained glass”) border on cliché; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the mandala and ashes, leaving a lingering emotional impact; however, slight pacing issues and underdeveloped dialogue prevent it from reaching top-tier polish.</comment>
