<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambassador Vera's fierce determination and diplomatic role are evident, but her motivations oscillate between personal grief and abstract duty, lacking deeper emotional grounding; her voice feels distinct yet underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the chain of letters driving the narrative, but pacing feels rushed, and causality between shared dreams and Vera’s actions remains vague, reducing coherence within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken zeppelin setting is vividly realized and enhances the ethereal tone of shared dreams; sensory details like underwater currents are effective, though some atmospheric elements feel over-symbolized and detract from immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on illusion versus truth, with strong symbolism (ghost costume, dreams as oil), but the ending feels more cryptic than satisfying; subtext is present but occasionally heavy-handed, overshadowing emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of shared dreams and time-spanning letters is original, some imagery (e.g., “insects in amber”) feels clichéd; emotional nuance is attempted but often stated rather than shown, and the tone wavers slightly in consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the zeppelin and dreams, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, hindering clarity; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as powerfully as intended.</comment>
