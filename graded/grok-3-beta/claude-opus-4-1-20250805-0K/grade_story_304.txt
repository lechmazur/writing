<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation as an assassin driven by personal loss is clear, but her character lacks depth beyond this singular drive; her actions align with her goal, yet her personality feels underdeveloped with no distinct voice or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, and the use of the camera as a tool for justice drives the narrative effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and some cause-effect links are implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly described with sensory details like stained titanium windows and borrowed starlight, enhancing the atmosphere; yet, the connection between setting and character motivation feels somewhat superficial, lacking deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response with its themes of justice and loss, supported by strong imagery like the paint-splattered lens; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and subtext is present but not fully layered or resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the concept of an assassin using a camera is intriguing, the story leans on familiar revenge tropes without significant subversion; metaphors like the spider's web are evocative but not entirely fresh, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the baroque asteroid and borrowed starlight, but the brief length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice; it leaves a lingering thought of justice, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
