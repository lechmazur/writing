<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to control the narrative of her scientific breakthrough is clear, but her dutiful sentinel trait feels underexplored beyond a surface level; her actions align with her goal, yet her voice and deeper personality lack distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a clear beginning, middle, and transformative end within the word limit; however, pacing feels slightly rushed toward the climax, and the cause-effect of the tank's release could be more logically detailed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The photosynthesis lab setting is vividly transformed into a wedding venue, enhancing the action and atmosphere; sensory details like shimmering green light are effective, though some sensory immersion feels secondary to plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about humanity's future and storytelling's power, with strong symbolism in the tank's release; the ending is purposeful, but emotional depth relies more on telling than showing, and dialogue is minimal and unremarkable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of scientific evolution tied to a wedding is original, but some metaphors (e.g., "impossible dawns") feel slightly generic; emotional resonance is present but lacks nuanced subtext, and the narrative occasionally follows predictable transformation tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent; it leaves a lingering idea of transformation, but the style occasionally prioritizes concept over clarity, and the brevity feels somewhat restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
