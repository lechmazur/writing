<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The nostalgic tailor’s character is intriguing, with clear motivation to transcend mortal limits, but the development feels incomplete; his past and emotional depth are hinted at rather than fully explored, limiting the impact of his confessions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by breaking the code and merging parallel lives, but the pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the resolution lacks grounding, making the transcendence concept somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observation deck and storm create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that complements the tone of hopeful desperation, though sensory details could be more varied beyond visual and auditory elements to deepen the setting’s impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and unease through its exploration of parallel lives, with strong imagery like “thread in acid,” but the emotional resonance is undermined by telling rather than showing the tailor’s fear and desperation; the ending feels more conceptual than satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of parallel lives offers originality, some metaphors like “buttons from worn fabric” feel slightly overused, and emotional handling lacks nuance at times, leaning on explicit confessions rather than subtext; still, the steampunk-multiverse blend shows creative intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its ambitious elements, leaving a lingering question about identity, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, limiting depth.</comment>
