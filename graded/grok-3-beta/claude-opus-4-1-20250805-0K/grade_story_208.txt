<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's background as a street musician shapes his melancholic yet passionate personality, but his motivations feel slightly underdeveloped; the sudden recognition of his own handwriting lacks deeper grounding in prior emotional context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a semblance of an arc with a reflective resolution, but pacing feels uneven; the temporal rewind and sorting of possibilities are intriguing yet abrupt, disrupting coherence within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The automated sorting facility is vividly realized with mechanical symphonies, enhancing the surreal atmosphere; sensory details are strong, though the connection between setting and emotional tone occasionally feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant mix of regret and humor, with strong imagery like "freight train of feathers"; however, the ending feels more conceptual than emotionally satisfying, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining jazz with mail sorting possibilities, avoiding overt clich√©s; yet, some metaphors ("tributaries down his cheeks") feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance could be deeper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of loss; however, the style occasionally veers into over-complexity, and the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
