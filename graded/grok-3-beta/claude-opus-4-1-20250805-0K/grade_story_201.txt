<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s impulsiveness and whimsical nature are evident in her actions, but her deeper emotional layers and distinct voice remain underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a satisfying resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between tracking shooting stars and the fortress feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and offers a fresh premise, some metaphors (e.g., “sacred flame”) feel generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but its style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity limits deeper resonance or lingering impact.</comment>
