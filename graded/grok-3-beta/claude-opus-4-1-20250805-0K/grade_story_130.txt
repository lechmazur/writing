<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mika’s character is shaped by her status as a lost apprentice, with clear motivation to find meaning in her wandering. Her reaction to the nest and phone reveals vulnerability, though her distinct voice feels slightly underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical connection between beginning and end. However, pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the action of reverse-engineering could be more directly tied to plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly realized with sensory details like impossible blossoms and gravity-shifted groves, enhancing the atmosphere. The setting strongly supports the mood, though the timeframe integration feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through Mika’s self-acceptance and uses potent symbolism with the nest. The ending is satisfying, but the central conflict feels understated, and some emotions are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in combining sci-fi with earthy nostalgia, avoiding overt clichés. However, some metaphors (e.g., growing gardens in the void) feel familiar, and emotional nuance occasionally lacks depth, bordering on predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought about self-acceptance. The brief length works as a deliberate choice, though style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
