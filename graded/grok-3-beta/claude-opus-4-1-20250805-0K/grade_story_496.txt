<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's portrayal as a repressed poet is compelling, with clear motivation to externalize his inner verses, but his personality lacks deeper nuance beyond fear and longing; reactions to the perfume bottle are symbolic yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, driven by the spontaneous exploration and ambush, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and cause-effect links between the bottle shattering and transformation are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The overgrown city setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like kudzu-strangled streetlights, enhancing the tone of knowing naivety and supporting Marcus's transformation; the timeframe integration is less impactful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus's release of poetry, with strong imagery and symbolism of the bottle, but the ending feels slightly overwrought; subtext is present but not fully layered, and dialogue lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of a poet's transformation is unique, some metaphors (stellar dust, unborn galaxies) verge on clich√© without subversion; emotional resonance is shown but occasionally stated, and the style feels ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements like the bottle and setting, leaving a lingering sense of transformation, but overly elaborate language sometimes obscures clarity, and the brevity feels slightly limiting.</comment>
