<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with the swordsman’s hidden promise and defiance, but the fiercely apathetic trait feels inconsistently portrayed—his shift to purpose lacks depth in internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at the transition to purpose; the meteor shower as a method drives the story but lacks logical grounding in its sudden urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock monastery setting is evocative and complements the tone of knowing naivety, enhancing the atmosphere, though sensory details are sparse and could immerse more deeply.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through defiance and departure, with effective symbolism of falling stars, but dialogue feels slightly stilted and the ending lacks a stronger punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some originality in the concept of following meteors as rebellion, but reliance on familiar tropes of weary warrior and wise mentor without subversion; metaphors like “ice before spring” feel slightly generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with elements mostly in service of the narrative, but lacks a lingering depth beyond the surface; style is clear but not distinctive enough for a top-tier publication.</comment>
