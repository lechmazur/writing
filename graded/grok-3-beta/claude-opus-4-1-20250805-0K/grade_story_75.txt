<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra's guarded nature and skepticism are clear, shaping her distrust of the Movement, but her emotional depth feels underdeveloped; her motivations, while consistent, lack nuanced personal stakes beyond inherited rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the decryption driving action, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; the connection between beginning and end is present but weakened by abrupt shifts in focus within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nano-forest setting is vividly described and enhances the grassroots theme, with strong sensory detail, but the atmosphere of "angry peace" feels inconsistently integrated with the futuristic dome's sterile tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about art and rebellion, with effective symbolism in the nano-forest's growth, but the emotional resonance is undercut by telling over showing; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying due to rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers originality in its cipher concept and nano-forest imagery, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some metaphors feel forced; emotional handling shows nuance in "angry peace" yet occasionally relies on stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering idea of grassroots resistance, but overly ambitious scope within the word limit slightly hinders clarity and depth; style supports the narrative yet isn't exceptional.</comment>
