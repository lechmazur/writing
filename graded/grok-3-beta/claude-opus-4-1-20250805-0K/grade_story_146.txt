<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlena's duality as a faux fortune teller with real visions shapes her internal conflict, but her motivations feel underdeveloped; her reaction to the flute reveals some depth, though her voice lacks distinctiveness in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with the exploration driving the story, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect relationships between visions and actions are not fully fleshed out within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting of Prague and the archive is evocative with strong sensory details, enhancing the mood of mystery, though the planting season timeframe feels underutilized in relation to the atmosphere and motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marlena's connection to the flute, with some effective symbolism, but the ending feels predictable and lacks deeper subtext or a truly resonant central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s and shows some originality in combining elements, the metaphors are occasionally generic, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, missing a truly unique authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a degree of cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels more like a limitation than a deliberate choice, and the lingering impact is moderate at best.</comment>
