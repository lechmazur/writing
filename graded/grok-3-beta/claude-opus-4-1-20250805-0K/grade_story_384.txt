<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maria's frantic nature is well-integrated into her actions and motivations, reflecting a clear personality through her chaotic yet calculated movements. However, her transformation to whistleblower feels slightly abrupt, lacking deeper internal conflict or nuanced voice to fully ground her evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and end within the word limit, driven by the action of subversion. However, pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the eraser and walking stick as plot devices is logical but not fully seamless, leaving minor gaps in cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The earthquake prediction facility setting is evocative and enhances the concept of scheduled disasters, with a tone of frenzied tranquility that complements Maria’s state. Sensory details are present but uneven, missing opportunities to deepen immersion in the basement kitchen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes tension and prompts thought about deception and control, with effective symbolism in the dough and forgotten letters. However, the ending feels more functional than deeply satisfying, and emotional resonance relies somewhat on telling rather than showing Maria’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of scheduled earthquakes is original, and the use of kitchen objects as evidence is inventive. Yet, some descriptions (e.g., "frenzied tranquility") feel slightly formulaic, and emotional depth lacks nuanced subtext, occasionally stating feelings rather than showing them through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the eraser and walking stick, and the brevity feels deliberate. However, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, slightly hindering clarity, and the lingering impact is present but not profoundly memorable.</comment>
