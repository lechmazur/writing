<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina’s stage fright is an intriguing trait, but its impact on her actions as an exorcist feels underexplored; her motivation to overcome her grandmother’s lies is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a satisfying resolution, and the action of submerging the factory drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed, missing deeper tension buildup within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital debris setting is vividly rendered and enhances the eerie atmosphere; sensory details like the sound of a key in space are striking, though the connection between setting and wildflowers feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marina’s defiance, with strong imagery like the sinking ballerina, but subtext is underdeveloped, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a profound lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a space exorcist and possessed toys is original, with fresh metaphors like the reverse-blooming garden, but some emotional descriptions lean on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but it lacks the depth or lingering resonance needed for top-tier publication; style is clear but not exceptional.</comment>
