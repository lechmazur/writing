<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the typewriter's silence and the approaching rescuer driving coherence; pacing is mostly effective, though the fever vision sequence feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Insect Symphony Hall is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like cicada concerts, enhancing the mystical atmosphere; the setting strongly supports the tone, though the timeframe integration feels slightly understated.</comment>
