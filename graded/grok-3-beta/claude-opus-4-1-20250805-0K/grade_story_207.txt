<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, with Marcus's rebellion against the Medical Collective aligning with his past as a healer, but his "meekly assertive" trait feels underexplored in action and lacks depth in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with small acts of defiance driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links are occasionally vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the abandoned medical bay enhances the tone of loneliness and redemption, with evocative details like cracked viewports, though sensory immersion could be more consistent across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus's quiet defiance and the bouquet's symbolism, but lacks deeper subtext or a truly memorable ending; conflict resolution feels predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s, and metaphors like the universe's song are somewhat fresh, but emotional portrayal leans on telling rather than showing, and the narrative lacks a truly unique stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with thoughtful integration of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice, and the lingering impact is present but not profound.</comment>
