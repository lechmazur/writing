<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to shatter the illusion is clear, but the aloof passion feels inconsistently portrayed, lacking depth in emotional nuance; the merchant's voice is indistinct and fails to fully resonate through actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from discovery to transmission, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though the butter churn's role as a data hideout strains believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting of the space station observation deck is vividly rendered and enhances the tone of desolation; sensory details are present but uneven, missing opportunities to deepen atmospheric immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response with the theme of bitter truth, but symbolism (e.g., butter churn) feels forced; ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch; central conflict is clear but lacks deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Originality is hampered by predictable dystopian tropes of illusion vs. truth; metaphors like "rebellious sparks" are somewhat generic; emotional handling leans on stated feelings rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative use of elements, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; length feels like a limitation rather than a strength; lingering impact is moderate but not profound.</comment>
