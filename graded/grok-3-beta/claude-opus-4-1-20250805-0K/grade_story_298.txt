<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Li Wei's chameleon nature as a stage actor is intriguing and shapes his investigative approach, but his motivation lacks depth beyond the surface trait of emotional mimicry; reactions to the doll’s dress are poignant yet not fully revelatory of inner conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is driven by the action of reproducing emotional states, and the arc achieves a resolution within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with rushed revelations in the final discovery; logical flow is maintained but lacks tighter cause-effect tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined ancient Chinese palace in a post-oil future is vividly rendered with hydroponic gardens and debris-filled skylights, enhancing the atmosphere of anxious serenity; sensory details like fractured rainbows are evocative but underutilized in connecting to character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Wei’s vulnerability and the child’s survival, with strong imagery like the doll’s dress as a symbol of loss; however, the ending feels slightly predictable, and the theme of art as survival lacks deeper subtext or surprising insight within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story offers a unique blend of theater and investigation, some descriptions (e.g., “beautiful ruins”) veer toward cliché without subversion; emotional handling shows nuance in Wei’s transformation but occasionally states feelings rather than fully showing them; overall style is distinct but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of assigned elements like the tattered dress and sunlight through debris, but the brief length exposes underdeveloped emotional stakes; it leaves a lingering thought about humanity, though not with exceptional depth or stylistic clarity.</comment>
