<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whisper collection point and starless night create a haunting atmosphere that enhances the theme of lost souls, with strong sensory details like gleaming brass and humming tubes, though some setting elements feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through the concept of reconciliation, with effective symbolism in crosswords as bridges, but the ending feels slightly predictable and lacks a deeper, lingering subtext.</comment>
