<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's jadedness as a bartender is adequately conveyed, but his transition to obsessive researcher feels underdeveloped. Motivation to understand his sister’s death is clear, yet his emotional depth and distinct voice are lacking, making his actions feel somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the action of globalizing a message driving the story forward. However, the concept of fate feels forced into the narrative, and pacing is uneven, with the climax rushed despite logical cause-and-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal growing laboratory setting is evocatively paired with the timeframe of New Year’s Eve, enhancing the mood of suspense. Sensory details like bioluminescent light and fireworks are effective, though the atmosphere occasionally feels detached from Marcus’s emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes some emotional response through Marcus’s loss and hope, with satisfying symbolism in crystals as fate. However, subtext is inconsistent, and the writing style, while competent, lacks a distinctive impact. Conflict resolution feels ambitious but not fully realized within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of doodles forming a global message is original, but reliance on collective unconscious tropes feels predictable without subversion. Emotional handling is more stated than shown, and metaphors like “frozen prophecies” are somewhat generic, lacking nuanced resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate. However, the style lacks clarity in places due to overly complex phrasing, and while it leaves a lingering thought of hope, the execution doesn’t fully elevate it to profound impact.</comment>
