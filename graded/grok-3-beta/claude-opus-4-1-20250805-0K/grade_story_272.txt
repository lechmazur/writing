<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear with regret driving Marcus’s actions, but his social awkwardness feels underexplored and lacks depth in interactions; his voice isn’t distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves a complete arc within the word limit with a logical connection from regret to purpose, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the revelation; coherence is maintained but lacks a sharper conflict escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The diner setting supports the late-night restless tone and pairs well with the timeframe, but sensory details are sparse, missing opportunities to deepen atmosphere beyond fluorescent lights and coffee.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story evokes some emotional response through regret and renewal themes, with decent symbolism in the whistle, but subtext is shallow; dialogue is functional but not memorable, and tension is underdeveloped for a lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clichés and shows some originality in the concept of encrypted artisan knowledge, but emotional depth feels stated rather than shown; metaphors like “tree of regret” are somewhat predictable, lacking unique style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements mostly serving the narrative, but the brief length exposes thin character depth and atmosphere; it leaves a lingering idea of preservation, yet lacks the polish or daring for top-tier publication.</comment>
