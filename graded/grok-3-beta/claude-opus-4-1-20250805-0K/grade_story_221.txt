<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's development as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is compelling, with clear motivation to step out of her sister’s shadow, but her distinct voice feels slightly underdeveloped in dialogue, lacking the depth expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent with a discernible beginning, middle, and resolution within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the emotional climax, missing a deeper exploration of Marina’s transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is evocatively detailed with sensory immersion (peeling paint, rusted rifles), enhancing the melancholic tone and supporting Marina’s haunting gift; however, the connection between setting and timeframe could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through symbolism (amber, half-written letter) and subtext about freedom and grief, but the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks a truly natural cadence, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story offers a fresh take on grief and rebellion, some metaphors (e.g., “slow, painful thaw”) feel familiar rather than innovative, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on explicit statements rather than pure showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the amber and carnival, leaving a lingering reflection on unfinished stories, though minor stylistic inconsistencies prevent it from reaching the highest echelon of polish.</comment>
