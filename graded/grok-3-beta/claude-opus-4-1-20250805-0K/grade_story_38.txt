<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is adequate with Marcus’s insomnia and poetic nature shaping his reflective tone, but his motivations shift too abruptly from vengeance to compassion without sufficient internal struggle or nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a clear beginning and resolution, but the pacing feels rushed at critical emotional turns, and the connection between subway stops and attic memories lacks seamless integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and subway timeframe create a compelling atmosphere, enhanced by sensory details of rustling paper and swaying trains, though the setting’s connection to botanical samples feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on non-violence through strong symbolism of botanical samples, but the emotional impact is diluted by overt telling rather than showing, and the ending feels predictably tidy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of transformation is original, the narrative leans on familiar redemption tropes without subversion, and some metaphors, like “bridges” for poetry, feel generic rather than fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like botanical samples, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity sometimes limits depth over emotional resonance.</comment>
