<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ambassador Chen’s confusion and diplomatic background shape her initial struggles and gradual learning, but her inner transformation lacks depth due to limited personal stakes or distinct voice beyond the role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from confusion to insight is clear within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at the resolution, and the action of liberalizing trade lacks concrete stakes or tension to drive urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The salt mine village setting is vividly rendered with evocative crystalline imagery, enhancing the eerie, isolated atmosphere, though sensory details beyond sight are underutilized, limiting full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on balance and contradiction through strong symbolism like murmurations, but the emotional impact is muted by overly explicit explanations rather than nuanced showing of Chen’s growth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of murmurations as a metaphor for diplomacy is fresh, but some imagery (e.g., "frozen tears") feels slightly clichéd, and emotional resonance leans on stated insights rather than subtle subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements like the spare key and murmurations, but the style occasionally overexplains, reducing depth, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
