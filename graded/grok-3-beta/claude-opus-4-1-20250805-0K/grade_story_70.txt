<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marcus's uptight nature is evident in his rigid posture and meticulous transcription, but his transformation to a willing participant feels slightly abrupt; motivation lacks deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot arc from observation to participation is clear and complete within constraints, driven by the action of discovery, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper emotional buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse and gravestone setting enhances the eerie, transformative tone, with evocative sensory details like lavender wax and smoke whispers; atmosphere strongly supports the theme of buried optimism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marcus’s shift and Elara’s release, with strong imagery and subtext of grief transformation; dialogue is purposeful, though the ending, while satisfying, lacks a final punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of grief transformation is original, some metaphors (e.g., “dawn breaking over headstones”) feel familiar; emotional resonance is shown rather than told, but character reasoning occasionally lacks nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the light bulb and memory-moss; style supports clarity, and the brief length feels deliberate, though it leaves some emotional depth unexplored.</comment>
