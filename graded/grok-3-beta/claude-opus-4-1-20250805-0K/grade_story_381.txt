<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map cave systems is clear and tied to the mentor relationship, but the hushed necromancer’s personality feels underdeveloped beyond quietness and nostalgia; lacks deeper internal conflict or unique voice in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with mapping as the central action, but pacing feels rushed at the end, and the connection between necromancy and cartography isn’t fully justified within the tight word limit, leaving some logical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Crystalline cave setting is vividly described with sensory details like hums and glow, enhancing the futuristic nostalgic tone; however, the integration of Titan’s terraformed moon feels underutilized and lacks specific atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through the mentor relationship, with effective dialogue and subtle symbolism in the cap; yet, the central conflict feels muted, and subtext about death and legacy isn’t fully explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing shows originality in combining necromancy with speleology and old movies, avoiding overt clichés; however, sensory details occasionally feel generic, and emotional resonance relies more on stated feelings than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion with assigned elements mostly in service of the narrative, and the brief length feels somewhat deliberate; yet, it lacks a lingering depth or question, and creative integration of elements like "between sets" feels forced at times.</comment>
