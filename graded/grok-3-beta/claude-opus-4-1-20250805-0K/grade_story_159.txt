<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to solve the labyrinth and restore his name is clear, but his "earnestly frivolous" attribute feels inconsistently applied, wavering between whimsy and gravitas without a cohesive voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but the confetti-coded method feels forced at times, disrupting logical flow and pacing in favor of symbolism over coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth and floating lanterns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances the tone of complex simplicity; sensory details are strong, though the connection between setting and weddings feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through its metaphor of labyrinths and love, with strong imagery and subtext, but the ending feels slightly pat, and dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness; tension is present but not fully sustained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of confetti-coded proofs is original, the narrative leans on familiar "forgotten genius" tropes without subversion; metaphors are fresh but occasionally over ornate, and emotional resonance feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity; it leaves a lingering idea, though not as sharply as it could.</comment>
