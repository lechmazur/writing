<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc feels complete within the word limit, with the map driving the narrative, but pacing is uneven—key moments like stepping through the tear feel rushed, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The witch’s menagerie is vividly realized with evocative sensory details like clicking needles and humming familiars, strongly supporting the atmosphere, though the timeframe of blanket crocheting feels underexplored.</comment>
