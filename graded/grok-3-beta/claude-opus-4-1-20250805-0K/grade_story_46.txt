<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera's blank-faced nature is intriguing and tied to her concentration, but her motivation to learn the language of dreams feels underdeveloped within the word limit, lacking deeper personal stakes or backstory to make her stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with Vera's pursuit and breakthrough, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the Council's denial lacks impact due to limited context; the structure is coherent but not gripping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard of giant ferns and waterfalls creates a vivid, immersive atmosphere, with sensory details like the singing water enhancing the mood; the setting strongly supports Vera's method, though the timeframe's significance feels slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story evokes wonder through dream translations (purple taste, copper smell), with strong imagery and subtext about human connection; however, the central conflict with the Council feels underdeveloped, and the ending, while poetic, lacks a sharper emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of dream-catching and moonlit translation is original, with fresh metaphors like tasting colors; yet, Vera's emotional nuance is stated more than shown, and the guardian trope feels familiar without enough subversion to fully distinguish it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative integration, leaving a lingering sense of mystery; however, the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice.</comment>
