<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Captain Zara's motivation to preserve farming methods is clear and ties to her philosophically practical attribute, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular focus. Her telekinetic dice are a unique trait, yet their use feels more decorative than revelatory of character. Dialogue is distinct but limited in showcasing a broader voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from decision to action is clear within the word limit, with a logical connection between preserving knowledge and broadcasting the tapestry's secrets. However, pacing feels slightly rushed, and the crew's dissent is underdeveloped, reducing tension. Coherence is maintained, but the conflict resolution lacks nuance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The space pirate navigation room is vividly rendered with sensory details like the hum of engines and crackle of flame, enhancing the sacred disorder tone. The setting supports Zara's motivation, but the connection between the medieval tapestry and futuristic space feels slightly strained despite thematic intent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through its theme of preserving knowledge, with effective symbolism in the dice and tapestry. The ending is purposeful but not deeply satisfying. Dialogue is functional but not memorable. Subtext is present but lacks complexity; central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clich√©s by blending space piracy with ancient agricultural wisdom, showing ingenuity. However, sensory details occasionally feel generic (e.g., "heat of the flame"), and emotional resonance leans on stated ideals rather than nuanced reactions. Writing style is clear but not strikingly individual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of disparate elements like telekinesis and farming traditions, leaving a lingering thought about legacy. However, the style is functional rather than exceptional, and the brevity feels like a constraint rather than a deliberate strength. Depth is present but not fully realized.</comment>
