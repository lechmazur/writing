<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters, especially Elias, show depth through backstory and motivation tied to loss, but Sarah feels underdeveloped as a mere sounding board with little distinct voice or agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear with a beginning, middle, and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax with the bird release; causality between elements is logical yet lacks deeper integration within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop and industrial wasteland create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details like soot and train whistles, enhancing the tone of loss, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotion through the theme of remembering innocence, with potent symbolism in the skateboard and birds, but dialogue feels occasionally stilted and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of mechanical birds as memory carriers is fresh, the steampunk trope and loss narrative lean on familiar ground without enough subversion; emotional resonance is present but sometimes explicitly stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering thought about innocence, but style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate.</comment>
