<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The woodsman’s motivation to map railways as a cover for searching for his brother is compelling, and his guilt over the hairbrush adds depth, but his personality lacks a distinct voice or nuance beyond remorse, making him feel somewhat archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from guilt to redemption is clear within the word limit, and the short-circuit action drives a pivotal moment, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, and the connection between the brother’s voice and the radio waves lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio wave garden is a striking, original setting that enhances the surreal tone and ties to the hospital monitor’s timeframe, with vivid imagery of invisible frequencies; however, sensory details beyond sound are sparse, limiting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the woodsman’s catharsis and the loss of his wife, with strong symbolism in the hairbrush and radio waves, but the dialogue is minimal and lacks impact, and the theme of honesty feels stated rather than subtly woven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story offers an inventive blend of technology and memory, avoiding clichéd tropes with its unique setting, though some metaphors like “spectral fingers” feel slightly overused, and emotional depth occasionally relies on direct statements rather than nuanced showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with its assigned elements and leaves a lingering sense of bittersweet resolution, but the style sometimes overreaches with ornate phrasing, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate, limiting deeper exploration.</comment>
