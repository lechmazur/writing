<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's stoic nature and motivation to defy conformity are clear, and his connection to the bird skull cameo adds depth, but his personality lacks a distinct voice or nuanced emotional layers beyond cynical warmth, limiting the character's impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with a logical progression from setup to action and resolution, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the board's reaction is anticipated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The miniature world museum setting is vividly realized and enhances the theme of façades, while the orchard gate timeframe adds a subtle cyclical tension; sensory details are present but could be more evocative to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on sanitized history through strong symbolism (cracks in the façade), with a satisfying ending, though the central conflict's resolution is implied rather than explored, and emotional showing is occasionally undercut by telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its subversion of sanitized history, with fresh imagery, but some phrasing (e.g., "discord's necessary song") borders on cliché, and emotional nuance feels slightly surface-level at times, missing deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering thought on truth in history; however, the style occasionally prioritizes theme over emotional depth, and the brevity feels more like a constraint than a choice.</comment>
