<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cyrusâ€™s motivation to weave dreams is clear and tied to his mechanical arm, but his personality lacks depth beyond obsession; dialogue feels functional but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible with a beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at the climax; cause and effect are logical, though some transitions are abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned lighthouse enhances the mood of isolation and mystery, paired well with coded desperation; sensory details are present but sparse, missing opportunities for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (lighthouse as loom) are evocative, and the theme of dream-reality interplay prompts thought, but emotional resonance is understated and dialogue lacks subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of weaving dreams is original, but some metaphors (butterflies of reason) feel overused; emotional nuance exists but leans on explicit statements rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering idea of reality-dream fusion, though not powerfully.</comment>
