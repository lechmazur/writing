<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysander's romantic doomed nature is clear, but his motivations lack depth beyond surface-level melancholy; his interaction with the keys reveals some backstory, yet his distinct voice feels muted in the third-person narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels uneven with heavy exposition; connections between beginning and end are present yet not fully cohesive, and the action of evading the spotlight drives little forward momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting of Utopia Design Studio and the timeframe before a new star's birth create a unique atmosphere; sensory details like the bell's echo stand out, though the tone of forgotten revelry sometimes overshadows character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism with the keys evoke emotion, and subtext about loss and obsolescence adds depth; however, the ending feels predictable, and the central conflict lacks sharp tension within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story offers some originality in combining elements, with fresh metaphors like "metal memories," but leans on tropes of the tragic artist without subversion; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves moderate cohesion with assigned elements, though some feel forced; the style supports clarity but lacks a lingering impact or profound depth beyond the explicit narrative.</comment>
