<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sister Margot's internal conflict and wavering faith are compelling, but her transformation lacks depth in motivation, feeling somewhat abrupt despite the setup of uncertainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is discernible but feels rushed at the climax; the connection between decoding echoes and transformation isn't fully logical, disrupting coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass desert and monarch butterfly migration create a haunting atmosphere, with vivid sensory details enhancing mood, though the mission house feels underutilized in relation to the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (monarchs, piano echoes) evoke thought, but the emotional impact is diluted by a lack of nuanced 'showing' in Margotâ€™s transformation; the ending feels purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story offers a unique take on faith and transformation, with fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate language borders on purple prose, and emotional resonance relies partly on explicit statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, but the brief length feels like a constraint rather than a choice; it leaves a lingering question about faith, though clarity is occasionally hindered by style.</comment>
