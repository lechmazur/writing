<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s transformation from history professor to vigilante is intriguing, and his subdued nature contrasts well with his rage, but his motivations lack depth beyond the loss of his sister and grandmother’s teachings. His voice is distinct yet underdeveloped in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and end, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments like the strike plan reveal. Cause and effect are logical, though some connections (e.g., mirror distortions to intel) strain plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned airport setting is evocatively bleak, enhancing the war-torn atmosphere and Marcus’s isolation. Sensory details like phantom announcements are effective, though smell and touch are underutilized. The tone of loss complements the setting well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a moderate emotional response through Marcus’s suppressed rage and evokes reflection on war’s cost. Imagery (mirror distortions, prayer bead) is strong, but the ending feels predictable. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; subtext is present but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés, and the mirror-tracking method feels inventive, but some descriptors (e.g., “screaming silence”) border on overused. Emotional nuance is shown rather than told, yet the narrative lacks a truly unique style or unexpected twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the bead and mirror, but the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate. It leaves a lingering sense of war’s toll, though not profoundly. Style supports clarity but isn’t exceptional.</comment>
