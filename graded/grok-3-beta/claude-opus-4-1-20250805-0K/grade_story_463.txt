<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s dry wit is present but underdeveloped, lacking consistent expression in dialogue or action beyond a few quips. His motivation to learn traditional methods is clear, yet his personal stakes feel shallow, missing deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with the Mariner's Waltz driving the narrative effectively. However, pacing feels slightly rushed toward the climax, and the resolution leans on exposition rather than action, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom is vividly rendered with sensory details like the smell of salt, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. The setting powerfully supports the tone and concept of eroding promises, though the timeframe’s impact feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on broken promises through strong symbolism (frayed rope, dissolving oaths). The ending is purposeful, but dialogue occasionally feels stilted. Subtext is present, though emotional depth could be shown more than told.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a dance with spirits is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "tongue turned to salt") feel overused. Emotional nuance is attempted but not fully realized, and the style, while distinct, borders on ornate at times, risking distraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the rope and dance. It leaves a lingering thought about letting go, but the style occasionally overcomplicates clarity, and the short length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
