<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as a professional cuddler is intriguing and shapes her internal conflict, but her motivation feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; the prejudice is clear, yet her transformation lacks a visceral, personal trigger beyond the ticket punch's influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc from shame to acceptance is coherent, with decay as a thematic driver, but pacing feels uneven; the middle lingers on abstract imagery, while the resolution rushes Mira's emotional shift, weakening cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport hangar is vividly realized with strong sensory detail (rust, old fuel), enhancing the tone of ancient novelty; however, the connection to the hush before a speech feels more metaphorical than immersive, slightly diluting atmospheric impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on human connection through potent symbolism (ticket punch as validation), but the central conflict of prejudice feels more stated than shown; the ending is satisfying, yet subtext occasionally overreaches into overt explanation, reducing emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a cuddler in a decaying spaceport is original, some metaphors (e.g., "binary stars") feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but leans toward explicitness, and the tone wavers between poetic and prosaic, lacking a fully distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering thought about comfort's value; however, the style occasionally obscures clarity with ornate phrasing, and the brevity feels more constraining than deliberate, limiting deeper impact.</comment>
