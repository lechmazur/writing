<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to map sacred spaces is intriguing but lacks depth in personal stakes; Thaliaâ€™s personality feels overshadowed by mystical elements rather than distinctly shaped by them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed at times, and the connection between filing season and the action is tenuously explained, disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and endless night create a vivid, immersive atmosphere with strong sensory details; however, the tone occasionally overpowers character focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism evoke thought, but the emotional resonance is inconsistent due to limited character depth; the ending is purposeful yet not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphors and a unique perspective, though some sensory details feel generic, and the tone wavers slightly with overly ornate language at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite numerous elements, with creative integration, but the style occasionally hinders clarity with dense mysticism; the brief length feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
