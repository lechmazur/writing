<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Morgana's character as a glamorous undertaker is intriguing and her motivation to preserve digital memories is clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond the role; her voice, while distinct, doesn't fully reveal nuanced layers of emotion or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the action of preservation driving the narrative, but the pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, and the connection between paint mixing and quantum storage is conceptually interesting yet logically tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is evocatively paired with the digital preservation theme, and sensory details like the metallic scent of paint enhance atmosphere, but the server room feels underutilized as a space for deeper mood-building or conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a bittersweet emotional response through the theme of memory-keeping, with strong imagery like "digital mausoleums," but the ending feels more conclusive than thought-provoking, and the central conflict lacks sharper tension within the short format.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of digital preservation is original and the family tradition adds a unique angle, but some metaphors like "chrysalises waiting to become eternal" feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its assigned elements with creative intent, leaving a lingering sense of loss and preservation, but the style occasionally prioritizes ornate description over clarity, and the brief length feels more constrained than deliberate.</comment>
