<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation to preserve her empire's memory is clear and consistent, driven by her status as a time refugee, but her personality lacks deeper nuance beyond quiet defiance; her 'trustworthy strange' attribute feels underexplored in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the catapulting of memories as a logical climax; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and the connection between beginning and end could be more emotionally reinforced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atom-powered lighthouse and temporal threshold setting are vividly realized with evocative details like "seconds stretched like taffy," enhancing the mood of eternal waiting; sensory immersion is strong, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response through Kessa's fading and the imagery of borrowed dawn, with strong symbolism in the tablecloth; the ending is satisfying, but subtext could be deepened beyond the surface theme of remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative offers originality in its temporal refugee concept and lighthouse mechanism, with fresh metaphors like "borrowed dawn"; however, some emotional descriptions are more stated than shown, slightly diminishing human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the tablecloth and lighthouse, leaving a lingering sense of loss and hope; style supports clarity, but the brief length occasionally limits emotional depth.</comment>
