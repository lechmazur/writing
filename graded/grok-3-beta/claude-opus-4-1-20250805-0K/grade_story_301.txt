<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thaddeus's philosopher background shapes his detached curiosity, but his motivation feels underdeveloped beyond inherited burden; reactions to the mug and codes lack deeper personal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arcs from discovery to revelation with logical cause and effect, but pacing feels rushed at the end; knitting as a method is intriguing yet underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The jazz-age speakeasy setting and time capsule enhance the atmosphere of forbidden knowledge; sensory details like glowing etchings are evocative, though some setting elements feel underutilized.</comment>
