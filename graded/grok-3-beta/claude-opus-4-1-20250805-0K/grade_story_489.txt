<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to honor ancestral traditions is clear and aligns with her actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond the role of conduit; her voice is not distinct enough for a standout character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with the dance driving the narrative effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing a beat for emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is vividly evoked with sensory details like the whale calls penetrating stone, enhancing the eerie yet reverent atmosphere; minor missed opportunities for deeper tactile imagery hold it back.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong sense of cultural loss and reconnection, with potent symbolism in the dance and whale songs; the ending is purposeful but lacks a final punch to make it truly unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the concept of ancestral wisdom is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., "tide of forgetting") feel slightly overused; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, limiting originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements like the whistle and dance, leaving a lingering thought about tradition; style is clear but not exceptional enough for top-tier impact.</comment>
