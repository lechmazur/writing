<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Takeshi’s arrogance and doubtfully confident nature are well-portrayed through his internal conflict and eventual humility, but his transformation feels slightly abrupt given the word limit, lacking deeper exploration of his past scorn for gentle arts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc from arrogance to remembrance, driven by the act of authorizing through song, but pacing feels rushed at the climax, with the emotional resolution slightly underdeveloped within the tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The calligraphy master’s courtyard enhances the reflective tone and complements the harsh tenderness, with vivid sensory details like the smell of smoke and sickness; however, the timeframe "between breaths" feels underexplored as a grounding element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through Takeshi’s rediscovery of memory, with effective symbolism in the tapestry and song, but the dialogue, while purposeful, lacks distinctiveness, and the theme of memory over steel could be more subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in blending swordsmanship with cultural memory, avoiding overt clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “bones remembered”) feel familiar, and emotional nuance occasionally leans on stated feelings rather than fully showing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creatively integrated elements like the song and tapestry, leaving a lingering sense of duty and loss, though the brief length slightly restricts depth, and the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing.</comment>
