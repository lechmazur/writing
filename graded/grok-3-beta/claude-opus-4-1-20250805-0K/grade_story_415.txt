<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marissa’s ability to taste memories as a chef shapes her internal conflict uniquely, but her motivation to sever ties feels slightly underdeveloped in emotional depth, lacking nuanced backstory to fully ground her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc within the word limit, with tracking rain trails driving the action logically, but pacing feels rushed at the confrontation, missing deeper exploration of the climactic moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Yodeling Valley’s acoustics and rain trails enhance the mood of isolation and reflection effectively; sensory details like silence and echoes stand out, though tactile and olfactory elements are underutilized.</comment>
