<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and poignant, driven by regret and longing for a lost daughter, but the knight's personality lacks deeper layers beyond the archetype of a guilt-ridden warrior; dialogue with the daughter reveals emotion but not a distinct voice for the knight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc within the word limit, centered on the impossible choice, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, diminishing the weight of the decision; cause and effect are logical, though the resolution leans on emotional impact over structural innovation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting of the lighthouse prison and jagged reef powerfully enhances the mood of isolation and torment; sensory details like crashing waves are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized; atmosphere strongly supports the theme of joyful agony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a strong emotional response through the father-daughter reunion and impossible choice; symbolism of the pattern and stones is effective, though some metaphors feel slightly conventional; ending is satisfying but not wholly unexpected; dialogue is natural and purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the concept of impossible choices and the mirrored reflection is unique, the knight archetype and grief trope are familiar without significant subversion; emotional handling is nuanced via subtext, but some descriptors like "breaking beautifully" verge on clich√©; writing shows style but not striking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with elements woven into a unified emotional narrative; style supports clarity, though brief length feels slightly constrictive rather than deliberate; leaves a lingering feeling of sorrow and reflection, but lacks a groundbreaking thought or question.</comment>
