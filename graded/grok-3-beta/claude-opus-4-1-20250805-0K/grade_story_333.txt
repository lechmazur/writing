<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's sincerity as a rebel and her motivation to preserve traditions are clear, but her personality lacks depth beyond determination and bitterness; her voice, while present, isn't distinct enough to stand out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the sticky note driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and cause-effect links between the note's messages and actions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted passage and storm timeframe create a compelling atmosphere that supports the tone of bitterness and rebellion; sensory details like "cold spots" are evocative, though more variety in sensory immersion could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of loss and defiance, with some effective symbolism in the sticky note, but the emotional depth is surface-level; dialogue is functional but not particularly natural or memorable, and subtext is present yet underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a changing message on a sticky note is original, the rebellion against authority feels somewhat trope-heavy without fresh subversion; emotional handling shows nuance in shared loss, but some descriptions (e.g., "fear rise like bile") are slightly clich√©d.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story coheres around its elements, with some creative integration of the sticky note and storms, but it lacks a truly lingering impact or depth; the brevity feels somewhat limiting rather than deliberate, missing a final punch for prestige publication.</comment>
