<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Koji's gentle nature and "faithfully unfaithful" attribute shape his actions, but his motivation feels somewhat abstract and underdeveloped within the tight word limit; his distinct voice is present but not fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc and coherence with a mystical resolution, but the pacing feels uneven, with rushed exposition and an abrupt ending; cause and effect are logical but not always impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dinosaur skeleton museum at night creates a striking atmosphere, enhanced by evocative details like moonlight and resonating bones; however, sensory immersion is inconsistent, and the timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
