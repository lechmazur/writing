<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters lack depth beyond their shared obsession; the soft-voiced guide's motivation is clear but feels one-dimensional, and the meteorologist remains a cipher despite their partnership.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is present with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels rushed at critical moments, and the blackout's cause-effect relationship to the action is underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive with creative element integration, but brevity limits emotional lingering; style supports clarity, though it occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>
