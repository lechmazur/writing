<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marina's wavering nature and motivation to escape her fate are clear, but her development feels surface-level; her internal conflict lacks deeper emotional texture or specificity in reactions, making her voice less distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, with carving messages driving the narrative, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the end, and cause-effect links between Marina's actions and outcomes remain ambiguous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal island setting enhances the themes of liminality and hope, with strong sensory details like "salt-bleached bark"; however, the atmosphere could be more consistently evocative to support Marina's emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional response through Marina's subtle hope, with effective symbolism in tides and bark, but the ending lacks a stronger punch, and subtext, while present, isn't fully layered or impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows some originality in its setting and concept of coded messages, but relies on familiar tropes of imprisonment and rebellion without subversion; metaphors like "tides" feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements like the tidal island and messages, but lacks a lingering depth or profound question; the style supports clarity but doesn't elevate the narrative to a truly memorable level.</comment>
