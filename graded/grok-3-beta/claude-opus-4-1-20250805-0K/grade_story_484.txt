<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to resist corporate takeover is clear, but his deeper drive to enter the mansion feels vague and inconsistently tied to his "uniquely generic" trait, which is mentioned but not deeply explored in behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, but the connection between the protest and the mansion exploration feels tenuous; pacing is uneven with a rushed ending, and the action of initiating lacks clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The haunted mansion graveyard setting is evocative and supports the encroaching darkness, with some sensory details enhancing mood, but the protest timeframe feels disconnected from the atmosphere inside, diluting overall immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story has moments of subtext about resistance and identity, and the ending is haunting, but emotional impact is muted by underdeveloped conflict and dialogue that feels more performative than natural; showing vs. telling is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>While the premise offers some originality, reliance on Gothic tropes without subversion and generic descriptors (e.g., "darkness pulsed") weaken authenticity; emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and tone shifts feel slightly unnatural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story achieves partial cohesion with assigned elements, but they often feel forced rather than organic; style is clear but lacks distinctiveness, and the short length feels more like a constraint than a deliberate choice, missing deeper resonance.</comment>
