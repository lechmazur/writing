<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unearthing action drives the plot effectively, and the story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, missing deeper exploration of the decision to stay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is vividly realized with evocative sensory details, enhancing the eerie, sacred atmosphere and complementing the tone of luminous doubt, though the connection to the raft's timeframe feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bottles as vessels of wisdom) and subtext about preserving knowledge evokes thought, though the ending, while purposeful, lacks a sharper emotional punch; the central theme of rediscovery is clear but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique setting and concept, avoiding overt clich√©s, but some descriptive phrases (e.g., "indifferent and eternal") feel slightly generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>
