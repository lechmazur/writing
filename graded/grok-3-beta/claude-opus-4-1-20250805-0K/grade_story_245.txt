<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's portrayal as an irate smuggler is convincing, with her rage and grief driving her actions, but her emotional depth feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit; her voice, while distinct, lacks a fully unique cadence in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with a satisfying resolution despite the tight word count, and the action of memorializing drives the narrative effectively; however, pacing feels slightly rushed toward the end, missing deeper exploration of the discovery's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like echoing footfalls and grimy surfaces, enhancing the mood of loss and defiance; the atmosphere strongly supports Mara’s motivation, though some sensory elements could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through Mara’s grief and purpose, with effective symbolism in the chopstick and waterfalls; the ending feels purposeful, but subtext could be further layered to enrich the narrative beyond surface themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining smuggling with hidden waterfalls as rebellion, avoiding predictable tropes; however, some metaphors (e.g., heart as vacuum) feel slightly overused, and emotional nuance occasionally leans toward stated rather than shown feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creatively integrated elements, and the brief length seems deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of purpose; however, minor stylistic choices, like repetitive emotional descriptors, slightly hinder clarity and impact.</comment>
