<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The feral ranger's unfiltered perception shapes her isolation and actions convincingly, and her motivation to guide the newborn is clear. However, her internal conflict lacks deeper nuance, and her voice, while distinct, could be more textured to reflect her wild existence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a sense of completeness with a discernible arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed in resolving the scale’s symbolism.

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dandelion field setting enhances the melancholic tone and ties beautifully to themes of potential and wishes, with strong sensory details like suspended seeds.

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotional resonance through the ranger’s duality of burden and hope, with effective symbolism in the scale and dew.
