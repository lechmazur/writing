<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation to revive lost brewing traditions is clear and aligns with her eager brewer persona, but her gleefully morose attribute feels underexplored, lacking depth in how it shapes her actions beyond a passing mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a beginning (discovery), middle (preparation), and end (hopeful distribution), but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the action of sweeping is incidental rather than driving the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility and timeframe of empire transitions work well together to create a melancholic atmosphere, enhanced by evocative details like dust and moonlight, though sensory immersion could be deeper with more varied tactile or olfactory descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a subtle emotional response with its theme of rebuilding through memory, and the symbolism of yeast as cultural heritage is effective, but the starlit conversations feel somewhat contrived, and the ending lacks a stronger punch for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of reviving a realm through brewing is intriguing, the execution relies on some predictable post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion, and the emotional resonance is stated more than shown, lacking nuanced subtext in Mira’s reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with most elements serving the narrative, and the brief length feels deliberate, but the style occasionally veers into overwritten descriptions, slightly hindering clarity and diminishing the lingering impact.</comment>
