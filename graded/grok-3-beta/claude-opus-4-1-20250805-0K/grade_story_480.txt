<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus Chen's role as a social media exorcist shapes his actions uniquely, but his motivations lack depth beyond professional routine; his reaction to the receipt hints at curiosity, yet his personal stakes remain vague, missing a distinct emotional core.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot progresses logically with the action of infiltrating clubs driving the narrative, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt within the word limit; pacing is managed, though the arc lacks a stronger emotional climax to feel fully complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mess hall and music hall timeframe create a haunting atmosphere that complements the concept of digital ghosts; sensory details like flickering lights are evocative, though more varied sensory immersion could heighten the mood further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes mild curiosity about digital identity and chosen invisibility, with some effective metaphors like "digital ghosts"; however, the emotional impact is muted, and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a lingering punch or deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a social media exorcist is fresh and avoids clich√©s, with unique metaphors like "feeding curiosity with life's raw edge"; yet, emotional nuance feels surface-level at times, and some descriptors (e.g., "quietly loud") risk feeling forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of assigned elements, and the brief length feels deliberate; however, the style occasionally lacks the polish for top-tier impact, and the lingering thought is present but not powerfully resonant.</comment>
