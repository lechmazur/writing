<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is poignant, driven by grief and a need to reconnect with Emma, but Mara’s personality lacks distinct depth beyond her role as a grieving mother and sheriff; her voice feels somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, with a clear emotional progression, but pacing feels uneven—some reflective moments linger too long, disrupting narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library and midday lull create a haunting, suspended atmosphere that enhances the tone of loss and rebellion; sensory details like dust motes as constellations are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Mara’s quiet rebellion and use of symbolism (chain, stars), with a satisfying ending, but the central conflict feels understated, and some deeper themes lack full exploration within the constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the concept of merging science and poetry is intriguing, metaphors like “frozen constellations” feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, lacking nuanced subtext at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative integration of elements, leaving a lingering sense of healing, but stylistic choices sometimes veer into overly ornate language, hindering clarity and impact.</comment>
