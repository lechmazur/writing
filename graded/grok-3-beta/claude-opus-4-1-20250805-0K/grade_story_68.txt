<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s moral code as a hacker is clear and drives his actions, but his personality lacks depth beyond this trait; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical progression within the word limit, but pacing feels slightly rushed at the resolution, and the connection between tea-steeping and historical restoration is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Roman marketplace is vivid and enhances the action, with sensory details like clinking bottle caps adding immersion; however, the tone occasionally wavers between modern tech and ancient gravitas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about erased histories and has subtle symbolism with bottle caps, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper character connection; the ending is satisfying yet not unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of historical hacking is original, and metaphors like “singing names” are fresh, but some descriptions (e.g., “confident uncertainty”) feel forced, and emotional nuance is stated rather than shown at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative integration of elements, but the brief length feels slightly limiting rather than deliberate; it leaves a lingering thought about hidden histories, though not profoundly so.</comment>
