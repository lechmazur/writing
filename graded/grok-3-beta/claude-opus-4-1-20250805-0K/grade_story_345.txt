<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Father Marcus's motivation to step beyond fate's design is clear and tied to his past as a lapsed priest, but his personality lacks depth beyond confusion and regret; reactions to the abacus are symbolic but not revealing of nuanced traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with jogging as action driving exploration, but pacing feels uneven—initial setup drags while the resolution rushes; snow patterns as method fit logically but lack deeper narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and bean stalks create a striking, surreal atmosphere that enhances the tone of dull radiance; sensory details like snow and shadows are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized; setting supports motivation well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism with the abacus and snow patterns, evoking reflection on faith and uncertainty; ending is purposeful but not fully satisfying; conflict is present but lacks visceral tension; theme of divine arithmetic is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh with bean stalks and upward-falling snow, avoiding clichés, but emotional resonance relies on stated insights rather than shown nuance; style is distinct but occasionally overwrought with metaphors, risking purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the abacus and labyrinth; style supports the surreal tone but sometimes hinders clarity with dense language; leaves a lingering thought on uncertainty, though depth is limited.</comment>
