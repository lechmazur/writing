<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcusâ€™s loyalty as a scout is evident, but his internal conflict and motivation lack depth; reactions to the journal feel somewhat surface-level, missing nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the outage and coded jokes driving progression, but pacing feels uneven, and some causal links between events are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moth observation tower and flickering city lights create a striking atmosphere of sanctified dread; sensory details like moth patterns are evocative, though smell and touch are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes thought through coded comedy and inner peace themes, with strong imagery (moths as mandala), but dialogue feels stilted at times, and emotional depth is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of coded jokes is original, some metaphors (darkness as canvas) feel overused; emotional portrayal lacks nuance, and the tone wavers slightly, risking predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements reasonably well, with creative use of comedy as instruction, but it lacks a fully cohesive punch; the length feels slightly restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
