<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kora's unsteady nature and motivation to reinterpret the prophecy are present, but her personality lacks depth beyond surface-level desperation; her voice feels indistinct despite dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete with a clear resolution, and the prophecy reinterpretation drives the narrative, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, missing deeper exploration within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The abandoned space freighter and colliding worlds create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere that supports the tone of cheerless ecstasy; sensory details like gravitational warping are effective, though smell and taste are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about fate and survival, with some symbolism in the bird and prophecy, but the emotional impact is muted by overt exposition; the ending is purposeful yet lacks a lingering punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of fate's ambush offers originality, and metaphors like "confetti from a funeral" are fresh, but emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and the narrative occasionally leans on sci-fi tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative use of elements like the automaton bird, but the style sometimes overexplains, reducing clarity; it leaves a mild lingering thought about prophecy, though not profoundly impactful.</comment>
