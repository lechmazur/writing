<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's vendetta and creativity as a candy sculptor are clear motivators, shaping her actions with purpose, but her personality lacks depth beyond this singular drive; her voice is indistinct as there’s little dialogue or internal monologue to reveal nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent with a clear arc from discovery to resolution within the word limit, driven by the counterattack via photographs; pacing is managed well, though the final reveal of the hidden continent feels slightly rushed and underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten market setting during the rebellion enhances the atmosphere of loss and resistance, with evocative details of broken stalls and sugar sculptures; sensory elements are strong, though smell and touch are underutilized compared to visual imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Elara’s quiet rebellion and use of art as resistance, with strong symbolism in sugar as preservation; the ending is satisfying, but the lack of dialogue limits character depth, and some subtext feels surface-level despite a clear theme of memory versus oppression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative shows originality in combining candy sculpting with rebellion, avoiding overly formulaic tropes, though some metaphors (e.g., "breadcrumbs of truth") feel slightly worn; emotional nuance is present but occasionally stated rather than shown, and the style is distinct yet not fully polished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with elements integrated in service of the narrative, showing creative thinking in the use of sugar as a medium for rebellion; the brief length works as a deliberate choice, leaving a lingering sense of hope, though minor depth issues prevent a higher score.</comment>
