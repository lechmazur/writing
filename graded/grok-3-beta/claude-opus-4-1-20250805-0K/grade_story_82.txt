<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc within the word limit, but pacing feels rushed toward the resolution; connections between elements are logical yet lack depth in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The futuristic hub and cursed orchard contrast effectively, enhancing atmosphere with evocative imagery like binary-whispering trees; sensory details are present but inconsistently vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through Marinaâ€™s realization, with strong symbolism in the dragon tooth; however, the ending feels slightly abrupt, and subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of a living archive is original, some metaphors (e.g., digital flowers) feel slightly generic; emotional resonance is shown but occasionally stated, lacking deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative element integration, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate phrasing; it leaves a lingering thought, though not as impactful as it could be.</comment>
