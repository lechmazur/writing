<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's cunning and morally ambiguous nature are evident in his actions and decisions, but his motivations lack deeper exploration; the connection to his grandmother feels more like a plot device than a fully realized emotional drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with the seed packets driving the narrative, but pacing feels uneven—rushed in the transition from grocery store to tower—and some cause-effect links, like the xerograph’s functionality, strain believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The smoke signal tower setting is evocative and ties well to the theme of forgotten messages, with strong sensory details like dust motes and storm clouds; however, the grocery store origin feels underutilized in enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes thought about food security and corporate greed, with effective symbolism in the seed packets and tower, but the ending lacks punch—Marcus’s choice feels predictable rather than deeply resonant; subtext is present but not fully layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of decoding forgotten agricultural knowledge is intriguing, some metaphors (e.g., "moths seeking light") feel slightly overused; emotional resonance is stated more than shown, and the narrative leans on familiar tropes of hidden family legacies without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with moderate cohesion, showing creative intent, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language that obscures clarity; it leaves a lingering question of Marcus’s choice but lacks profound depth beyond the surface narrative.</comment>
