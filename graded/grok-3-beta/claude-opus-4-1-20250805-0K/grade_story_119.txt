<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation of unyielding compassion is clear and drives his actions, but his personality as a secret astral projector feels underdeveloped, lacking a distinct voice or deeper internal conflict beyond the immediate crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc with a beginning, middle, and resolution, and the action of fleeing drives the tension; however, pacing feels slightly rushed within the word limit, and cause-effect links between the key and Hollow Ones are underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival roller coaster track is vividly described and enhances the eerie atmosphere, with sensory details like warped planks and shifting shadows; yet, the connection between the setting and the antique key feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a mild emotional response through Marcus’s protective instinct, with some effective imagery (golden refractions of the key); however, the ending lacks a deeper punch, and subtext about dual worlds is only surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story offers a unique blend of astral projection and supernatural threat, avoiding overt clichés, but some descriptions (e.g., “whistle wrong”) feel slightly forced, and emotional nuance is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive with creative integration of elements like the key and shadows, but the style occasionally lacks clarity with overly poetic phrasing; it leaves a lingering sense of duty, though not profoundly so.</comment>
