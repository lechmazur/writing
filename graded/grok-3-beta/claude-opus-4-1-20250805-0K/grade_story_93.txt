<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to protect his discoveries and daughter is clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond the crisis; his voice feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc within the word limit, with evasion driving tension, though pacing feels slightly rushed at the end; cause and effect are mostly logical but lack some nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The migration pattern archive setting is evocative and enhances the labyrinth theme, with amber lights and maps creating atmosphere; sensory details are present but not consistently vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion through the farewell and has symbolic depth with migration patterns, but the ending feels slightly predictable; conflict is clear but resolution lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept of migration labyrinths is original, some metaphors (e.g., "like seeds") feel overused; emotional resonance is present but often stated rather than shown with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with creative use of elements, but the style occasionally overreaches with ornate language; it leaves a lingering thought, though not profoundly so.</comment>
