<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters like Miguel and Elena are intriguing, with motivations rooted in tradition and ritual, but their development feels surface-level; deeper emotional nuance or backstory is needed for a stronger connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning and resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed, and the cause-effect links between overlapping worlds and character actions are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting of the ancient Aztec temple turned cemetery is vivid and enhances the mystical atmosphere; sensory details like the "hush of wind" are evocative, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a contemplative mood with strong imagery and subtext about life and death, but the dialogue feels slightly stilted, and the central conflict lacks deeper emotional stakes for true resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the concept of overlapping worlds is fresh, some metaphors (e.g., "oil from water") feel generic, and emotional depth is stated rather than shown, hinting at a lack of nuanced human texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion with creative use of elements, leaving a lingering mystical impression, but stylistic flourishes occasionally hinder clarity, and the brief length feels more limiting than deliberate.</comment>
