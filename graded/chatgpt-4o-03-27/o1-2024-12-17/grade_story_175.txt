<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel is vividly drawn with consistent motivation and symbolic actions; his refusal to cage the bird and obsession with the sign deepen his character, though his "innocently mischievous" trait is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and thematic resolution, but the pacing occasionally drifts into repetition, and the climax lacks a sharp narrative turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mushroom village is richly atmospheric, with sensory detail and tone enhancing the mystical decay; the phosphorescent imagery and shifting sign are especially evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism is layered and effective, especially the birdcage and chipped paint; the story evokes reflection and emotional resonance, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality is strong, with fresh metaphors and a unique setting; a few phrases feel slightly ornamental, but the voice remains largely consistent and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with a haunting tone and emotional payoff; minor redundancies and a slightly diffuse climax prevent a perfect score.</comment>
