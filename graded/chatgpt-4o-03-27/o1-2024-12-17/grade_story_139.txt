<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The monk's motivations are clearly rooted in solemn duty and internal conflict, with his stubbornness and vow to outsmart his dark reflection consistently shaping his actions; however, his emotional arc could be deepened further for full resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the gondola journey provides a strong narrative spine; however, some transitions between mystical elements feel slightly abrupt or underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory details and a tone that enhances the monk’s internal and external journey; the mountains and mists effectively mirror the story’s themes of mystery and introspection.</comment>
