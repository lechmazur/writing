<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The warlock's obsession is consistent and compelling, but his personality lacks nuance beyond his pursuit; his 'formally casual' trait is more aesthetic than psychological.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, escalation, and climax, though the resolution leans heavily on abstraction rather than narrative closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels overly ornate or mechanical, and the narrative occasionally lapses into cliché; however, the concept is handled with some originality and thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative use of elements, though it lacks the emotional complexity and stylistic precision required for top-tier publication.</comment>
