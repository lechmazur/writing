<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sculptor's motivations are clearly rooted in his desire for freedom, and his brooding nature is consistently reflected in his introspective actions and symbolic use of the clay figure; however, his emotional arc could be deepened with more interpersonal tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the climax—his disappearance—feels slightly underexplored and could benefit from more narrative tension or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in its imagery and concept; some phrases verge on overwrought, but overall the language is purposeful and evocative, with a distinct voice and style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative integration of elements and a lingering sense of melancholy and hope; minor improvements in pacing and emotional climax would elevate it further.</comment>
