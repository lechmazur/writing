<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchardist's motivation is clearly rooted in personal tragedy, and his actions—meticulous, obsessive, and symbolically rich—align well with his traits; however, his emotional arc could be deepened with more internal conflict or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds to a satisfying climax, but the pacing occasionally feels rushed, and some transitions between investigative steps are abrupt or overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is imaginative and supports the tone, but sensory detail is sparse, and the atmosphere could be more immersive with richer physical descriptions of the facility and its odd juxtaposition with orchards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is thematically layered with grief, obsession, and justice; the peacock motif and letter seal symbolism are compelling, though some metaphors verge on overuse and could benefit from restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows originality in concept, some phrasing feels overly formal or mechanical, and a few transitions suggest formulaic structuring rather than organic flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with creative use of elements; however, it stops short of literary excellence due to occasional stiffness in prose and underdeveloped sensory immersion.</comment>
