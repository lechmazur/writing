<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The swordsman's internal conflict and motivation are clearly conveyed through his weariness, symbolic attachment to the bag, and ultimate decision to persevere; however, his "fierce apathy" is more told than shown, slightly weakening the depth of his portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc—resignation, reflection, and renewed resolve—but the pacing is slightly static, with much internal rumination and little external action, which limits narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory details (mist, incense, chimes) that enhance the mood and support the character’s emotional state and journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (meteor showers, cloth bag), though the prose occasionally leans toward the overly poetic, slightly diluting impact through repetition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrasing feels overly polished or abstract, and the emotional beats, though sincere, occasionally lack the rawness of lived experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, with a strong emotional throughline and a satisfying conclusion, though it could benefit from more dynamic variation in tone and rhythm.</comment>
