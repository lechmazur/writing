<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The swashbuckler's motivations are clearly rooted in loss and compassion, and his actions—especially his reverence for the hatpin—align with his internal drive; however, his emotional arc remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a sense of progression, with a beginning, middle, and resolution; the marble-charting method is eccentric but integrated, though the ending feels slightly rushed.</comment>
