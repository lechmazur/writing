<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler’s transformation from aimless to purposeful is convincingly rendered, with his motivation to preserve indigenous recipes emerging organically; however, his “factually imaginative” trait is more implied than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the hopscotch decoding method feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive is richly imagined, with sensory details and atmosphere that support the tone and theme; the snow imagery and lantern-lit setting enhance the mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story evokes a poignant emotional response and uses symbolism (handkerchief, snow, food) well; however, the central conflict is subtle and could benefit from more tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrases verge on overly poetic or abstract, and the hopscotch decoding feels like a symbolic flourish rather than a functional narrative device.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with strong thematic unity and a clear voice; minor elements feel ornamental rather than essential, slightly weakening overall impact.</comment>
