<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Arlo is distinct and consistent, with his elegantly clumsy nature and ghost-seeing ability shaping his actions; however, his emotional arc could be more deeply internalized for greater resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with logical cause-effect progression; some transitions feel slightly abrupt, but overall coherence is strong within the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly the flower crown and silence; the ending is emotionally satisfying, though some moments verge on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and emotional nuance, but a few phrases feel slightly generic or overly poetic; the story avoids clichés but doesn’t fully subvert expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Well-executed within constraints, with a cohesive tone and emotional payoff; a few elements feel slightly ornamental rather than essential, but overall impact is strong.</comment>
