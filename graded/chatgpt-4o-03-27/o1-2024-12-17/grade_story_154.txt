<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ewan’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal conflict lacks depth and specificity; his “strongly weak” nature is stated rather than shown through layered behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions feel abrupt and some cause-effect links (e.g., levitation) lack grounding; pacing is mostly effective but occasionally drifts into vagueness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong visual cues, but sensory immersion is uneven and the “reimagined” aspect of the Celtic village is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story has emotional resonance and symbolic ambition, but leans heavily on telling rather than showing; metaphors are present but not always fresh or precise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but moments of generic phrasing and AI-like repetition (“jubilant despair,” “strongly weak”) reduce authenticity and stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but lacks the polish and nuance expected at the highest literary level; creative, but not yet refined or emotionally layered enough.</comment>
