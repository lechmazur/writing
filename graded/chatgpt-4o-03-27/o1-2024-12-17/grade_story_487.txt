<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Holt’s characterization as a “docile bruiser” is consistently and effectively portrayed through his gentle handling of violence and internal conflict over the baton’s power; his motivation is clear and aligns with his actions, though his emotional arc could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the pacing is strong, though the climax resolves a bit too quickly, and some transitions between scenes feel slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, and the atmosphere of tension and surrealism supports the character’s journey and the story’s tone exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses metaphor and symbolism effectively (e.g., the baton as power over life/death), and the ending is thematically resonant, though the emotional impact could be more layered with deeper subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic flair, some phrasing veers toward overwrought or formulaic, and a few metaphors feel slightly generic; still, the voice is mostly distinct and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtfully constructed, with creative integration of elements and a lingering thematic resonance; minor stylistic excesses prevent a higher score.</comment>
