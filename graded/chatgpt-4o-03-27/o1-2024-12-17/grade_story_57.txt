<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Herbert’s submissiveness, perceptiveness, and internal conflict are well-developed and consistent; his motivation to protect the creature aligns with his personality and is convincingly portrayed through action and reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, though the transition from yard work to espionage workshop strains plausibility slightly; pacing is strong and cause-effect relationships are mostly coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and supports the character’s emotional journey, though the setting of a “secret agent workshop” amid yard work feels conceptually strained and underdeveloped in sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant, with effective use of irony and symbolism (e.g., the dull letter opener); the ending is satisfying and thematically rich, though some moments verge on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>There’s originality in the character and tone, but occasional phrasing feels slightly generic or overly formal; the story avoids clichés but doesn’t fully subvert genre expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtfully constructed, with strong thematic unity and emotional payoff; a few elements feel slightly forced, but overall it’s a compelling and polished piece.</comment>
