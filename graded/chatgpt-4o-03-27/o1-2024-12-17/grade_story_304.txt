<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The assassin is rendered with emotional complexity and a clear arc from detachment to empathy; his motivation to "cradle the dawn" is poetic yet consistent, though the bus driver remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear turning point and resolution; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the assassin’s shift, while moving, borders on abrupt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and poetic language creates emotional depth; the ending is satisfying and thematically resonant, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally original and emotionally nuanced, but occasional phrases feel slightly ornamental or generic, and the spider-web method is underutilized and feels tacked on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a strong thematic throughline and elegant prose; minor weaknesses in pacing and integration of one or two elements prevent a higher score.</comment>
