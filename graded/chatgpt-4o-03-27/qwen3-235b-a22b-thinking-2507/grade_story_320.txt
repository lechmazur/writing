<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is structurally complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and effective use of cause and effect, though the climax resolves almost too cleanly and rapidly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesively executed with strong thematic clarity; blends complex narrative threads smoothly into a satisfying whole with lingering emotional depth.</comment>
