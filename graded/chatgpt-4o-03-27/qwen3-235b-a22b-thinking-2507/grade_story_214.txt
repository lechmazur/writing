<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara has a compelling internal motivation driven by loss and a well-drawn emotional arc; her connection with the sea glass effectively reveals her inner world, though a slightly stronger voice or interaction with others would enhance dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot moves with purpose and an elegant arc, culminating in a satisfying resolution; however, the shift from scientific decoding to emotional revelation edges toward thematic abstraction that slightly stretches narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive—icy observatory textures, nebular light, and sonic vibrations convey a tangible, moody setting that parallels the emotional stakes beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful thematic resonance, elegant symbolism (sea glass, black hole, light), and poetic language all elevate the narrative—with standout lines and a heartfelt conclusion that lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive metaphors and fresh execution of common motifs (loss, hope, space) show strong authorial voice; mild risk of over-poetic diction in places edges close to purple prose but remains mostly restrained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally creative, emotionally sophisticated, and cohesive—this story delivers layered meaning and a resonant close while integrating required elements with nuance.</comment>
