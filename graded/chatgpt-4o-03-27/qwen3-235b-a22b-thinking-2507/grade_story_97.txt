<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s transformation from emotionally-detached to vulnerable is well-earned and emotionally consistent; her fact-minded nature clashes meaningfully with slow emotional awakening, though a few internal transitions could be more sharply defined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vision-driven structure maintains coherence and flow within the constraints; the emotional arc progresses logically, though the middle sags slightly with repetition before the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The unstable dimension and surreal transformations are vividly rendered with sensory details and metaphor; setting strongly supports the character’s journey and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant with strong metaphoric layering (e.g., compass as empathy), poetic language mostly avoids sentimentality, and subtext about emotional repression and recovery is powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly fresh and avoids AI tropes; metaphors are specific, though a few phrases—like “optimistic desperation”—border on thematic over-insistence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Effectively blends all elements into a cohesive, emotionally impactful narrative with thematic depth; brief length enhances rather than inhibits its storytelling arc.</comment>
