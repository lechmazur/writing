<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arc follows a logical and emotionally satisfying path from routine to discovery to transformation, but the ticket-trigger mechanism risks feeling slightly rushed or underexplained near the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of disparate elements into a compelling whole; thoughtful execution just shy of masterful polish needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
