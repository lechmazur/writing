<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is rendered with striking emotional clarity—his internal conflict and self-deception feel authentic and earned. His transformation, sparked by the symbolic shard, aligns well with his bruised fighter persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution within the short form, though some transitions (e.g., from memory to decision) feel slightly compressed or metaphorically dense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic and sculptor’s soundscape are evocatively drawn, reinforcing mood and mirroring Elias’s inner change; atmospheric detail is rich and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The symbolism (shard, clockwork, sculptor’s chisel) is deftly layered, and the emotion lands with resonance. The prose balances lyricism and control, only occasionally tipping into overreach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mostly original and emotionally nuanced, with a few metaphorical flourishes that verge on overly ornate. Still, the imagery feels intentional, not mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive, emotionally lingering, and thematically rich; the story feels like a purposeful whole rather than an assembled prompt exercise.</comment>
