<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kenji is delicately and consistently portrayed; his motivations are deeply aligned with his traits, and the metaphor of decoding stars to shape earthly forms reveals his personality without overt exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Despite the lyrical pacing, the story maintains a coherent arc from subtle observation to symbolic exchange to thematic convergence; however, the catalyst remains oblique rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A near-complete work of microfiction: emotionally and thematically cohesive, rich with layered meaning, though bordering on the overly abstract for general resonance.</comment>
