<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zephyr’s motivation is clear, consistent, and vividly expressed through her actions and the sensory world she navigates; her "feral" nature informs her methods well, though the emotional depth of her inner life could be explored more fully for maximal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a tight arc and satisfying resolution within its constraints, but the action that triggers the climax (the humming and song redirection) relies on abstraction that may strain coherence for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stunning atmosphere; rich sensory detail immerses the reader completely in this surreal, melancholic world – the setting is integral to tone and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story’s lyrical prose, subtext around artistic resistance, and symbolic use of music create a resonant impact, though it comes close to overly ornate at times, risking clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and haunting; metaphors and sensory details are fresh and specific with minimal cliché, though occasional poetic excess flirts with “purple prose.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative with a lingering emotional and thematic impact; strong thematic unity around creation, preservation, and resistance, though slightly inaccessible due to dense abstraction in places.</comment>
