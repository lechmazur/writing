<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas’s personality and motivation are intricately interwoven—his humble arrogance and cynicism drive his actions and internal monologue with clarity and depth; his response to the globe reveals emotional vulnerability and determination, though some phrasing edges toward overt introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and logically structured, with strong cause-effect progression from the echo experiment to the globe’s awakening; pacing is mostly well-managed, though the resolution leans heavily on atmosphere rather than narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is atmospheric and immersive—details like mildew, salt, and ghostly echoes create a vivid, tangible setting that enhances both character and tone; the library-lighthouse fusion and its physicality strongly reinforce the theme of isolation and forgotten knowledge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story resonates with emotional depth and poetic symbolism, particularly in the globe’s reawakening and the echoes of past astronomers; minor risk of overwriting ("melancholic perfume") slightly detracts from otherwise evocative language and strong central theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite a few flirtations with ornate prose, the voice and metaphors are generally fresh, focused, and cohesive; the symbolism of resonance and fading magic is meaningful rather than mechanical, and the emotional beats feel human, not templated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A richly cohesive narrative where all elements—character, setting, tone—work in precise harmony; it evokes a strong sense of mood and meaning within its constraint, with an ending that lingers as both closure and quiet revelation.</comment>
