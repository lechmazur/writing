<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s background as a storm chaser directly informs his reactions and motivations; his emotional arc from trembling reluctance to quiet resolve is well-developed and consistent, though his internal conflict could be explored in slightly more depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc, with a strong sense of purpose and resolution; the unraveling and eventual repair mirror the protagonist’s transformation, though the middle section verges on density that risks slightly slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of desert and alpine monastery is richly atmospheric and integral to the tone; vivid sensory detail (icy stone walls, golden twilight) deepens both setting and mood with exceptional finesse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant, symbolically layered, and thematically rich; the carousel as metaphor for healing is elegantly executed, though some symbolism (e.g., celestial dancers) might benefit from slight clarifying context.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a consistent lyrical voice elevate the story; a few moments flirt with over-ornamentation, but overall the prose feels intentional and avoids formulaic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive; the elements serve the narrative rather than overwhelm it, and the emotional throughline is both subtle and satisfying. The story lingers meaningfully beyond its final image.</comment>
