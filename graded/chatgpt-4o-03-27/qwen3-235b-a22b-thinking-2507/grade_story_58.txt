<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is strong—her fierce loyalty, motivation, and internal conflict are deeply integrated into the narrative, with her use of comedy aligning well with her subversive role; however, a touch more dialogue or interaction could further humanize her voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and purposeful, with the outage catalyzing Elara's mission; transitions are smooth, though the ending is slightly more evocative than conclusive, relying heavily on atmosphere over resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric execution—sensory details like the fluttering moths and "cathedral of darkness" ground the reader in a haunting, immersive world that amplifies both theme and emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is thematically rich, anchored by metaphor and subtext; it evokes revolutionary urgency and quiet intimacy simultaneously, though the punchline cipher concept could be clarified more for full reader impact.</comment>
