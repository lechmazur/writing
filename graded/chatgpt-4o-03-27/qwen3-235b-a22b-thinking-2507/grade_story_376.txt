<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to archive emotional patterns is consistently supported by her actions and symbolic use of the inkwell; her rogue and "modestly flashy" traits add depth, though the scholar's character remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is subtle but coherent, with a quiet yet resolved emotional exchange forming the core plot; however, the pacing slightly meanders and the zigzag action feels more metaphorical than plot-driving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory detail and excellent integration of setting, tone, and character motivation; the longhouse and era enhance the emotional stakes without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story evokes quiet poignance through lyrical prose and strong symbolism, especially in the inkwell and wine rituals; subtext and emotional layering elevate its impact, though stakes remain low-scale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Despite the brief format, the story achieves cohesion and thematic depth, with originality and stylistic confidence evident throughout; slightly more tension or variation in tone could push it higher.</comment>
