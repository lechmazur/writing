<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The page is well-defined through their “unstoppable curiosity,” aloof demeanor, and growth into purposeful action; their motivations are consistent and effectively conveyed through interactions and decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot has a tight arc with clear cause and effect—strike leading to discovery, alliance, and action. The pacing is efficient and satisfying within the word limit, with minimal narrative drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking sensory detail and atmosphere—the rusted containers, thick salt air, and mist—enhance the mood and reflect the story's themes of decay and reclamation. The setting feels lived-in and metaphorically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (light, salt, containers as barriers), emotionally resonant transformation arc, and subtext around truth/lies. The ending lands with subtle power rather than overt catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché with fresh phrases and imagery (e.g., “salt clung thick as regret”), though a few turns lean toward the stylized. Subversion of tropes is present but not radical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An evocative, layered short story that achieves cohesion and emotional impact; the elements integrate smoothly and with intention. Deliberately contained yet expansive in implication.</comment>
