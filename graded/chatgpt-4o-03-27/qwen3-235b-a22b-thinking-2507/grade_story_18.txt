<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, aligned with her action and demeanor; her tragically joyful interiority is well-conveyed, but the emotional development of the secondary character is slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a graceful arc and satisfying resolution within the tight word count, but some transitions feel overly lyrical and slightly blur causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptionally immersiveâ€”sensory detail and thematic alignment of the steam-powered square with deceit and obscured truth are vividly rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance, layered metaphors (ink, truth, decay), and a poetic yet controlled tone; tension is quiet but compelling. Minimal dialogue used effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A few phrases verge on overly ornate, but overall the voice feels deliberate and human; metaphors are fresh and symbolism well-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and emotionally poignant; the elements serve the theme rather than dominating it. Slightly over-dense prose in places but otherwise tightly structured.</comment>
