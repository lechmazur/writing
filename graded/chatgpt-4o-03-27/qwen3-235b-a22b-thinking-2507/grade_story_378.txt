<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas is distinctly drawn, and his arc from grumpy isolation to reluctant leadership is believable and emotionally grounded; however, his shift toward action feels slightly abrupt given the story’s brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative flows well with a strong arc and a poetic resolution, but moments such as the monks’ immediate trust and the beetle’s transformation feel slightly rushed and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story conjures an evocative, moody world rich in texture and symbolism through vivid, immersive sensory detail; the setting deeply supports tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>There is strong imagery and thematic layering (decay, renewal); the beetle’s transformation functions as elegant metaphor, though some transitions are a touch too neat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and organic detail elevate the story above cliché, and the concept of “water wisdom” is handled with originality, though a few lines trend toward overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant piece with symbolic depth and stylistic clarity; its brevity is largely an asset, though a few moments would benefit from slightly more development.</comment>
