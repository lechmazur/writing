<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-developed character with consistent motivation rooted in doubt and longing; his use of the fork and his response to the desert reflect a clear personality shift, though slightly affected by a lack of internal conflict evolution across the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure achieves a beginning, middle, and resolution with clarity and purpose; the act of concealment builds tension and leads to thematic closure, though a deeper complication or twist could have added dimensionality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass desert, rusted piano, and monarch migration are vividly imagined and deeply atmospheric, enhancing mood and theme with rich sensory imagery and symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional and thematic depth through strong symbolism (fork, piano, butterfly) and lyrical prose; a touch more textual restraint could heighten the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality and nuance are strong throughout—especially the fusion of object and method—though certain phrasings fall near the edge of being overly ornate or poetic for clarity’s sake.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive and emotionally resonant piece with all elements integrated meaningfully; slightly more narrative tension mid-way could elevate it to perfection.</comment>
