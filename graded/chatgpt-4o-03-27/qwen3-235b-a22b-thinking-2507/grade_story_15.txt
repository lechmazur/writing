<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is subtle but complete, balancing repetition with emotional escalation. The first returned postcard provides a satisfying pivot-point without resorting to contrivance. A slightly firmer sense of external stakes might elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sensory world is immersive and atmospheric: dampness, decay, and muted hope coalesce into a setting that breathes. The fog, orchard, and tethered forge are seamlessly integrated, making the mood feel both lived-in and symbolic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegantly crafted and emotionally resonant, the story blends metaphor, character, and theme with restraint. The use of absurdity, symbolism (keyhole, tether, forge), and lyrical prose delivers both poignancy and subtle tension without overstatement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché while employing familiar mythic motifs with fresh, gentle surrealism. Language is lyrical yet grounded, though a few turns of phrase veer close to stylized repetition. Emotional nuance prevails over exposition.</comment>
