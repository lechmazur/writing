<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlowe's personality—rebellious, clever, and driven—is vividly rendered; her motivation is clear and consistently supported by action and internal logic, though slight nuance in emotional depth is missing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arc from subversion to rupture is coherent and compelling, but the structure leans more on mood and concept than on a tightly resolved narrative; ending feels earned but not conclusive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile setting sharply contrasts the chaotic aesthetic Marlowe injects, and vivid details (spice jars, flickering lights) successfully build atmosphere; slight room remains for sensory expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and vivid imagery elevate narrative voice; symbolism of entropy is strong, though the lack of dialogue limits emotional layering and tension development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong, original concept presented with confident style and specific, creative detail; avoids cliché and maintains tonal consistency throughout, though a touch more unpredictability could enhance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive, stylistically bold, and cohesive; all assigned elements support theme, though a slightly deeper resolution would increase emotional impact and elevate it to the upper tier.</comment>
