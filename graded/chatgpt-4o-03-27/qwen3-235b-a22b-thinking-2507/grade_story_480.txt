<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation is clearly defined and consistently expressed through his actions and perspective; his role as a “social media exorcist” is an original and symbolic lens, though his voice could be sharpened slightly for individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is well-executed, with a clear arc and satisfying emotional resolution; the “final chord” creates bookends with the violin, though a minor mid-story lull prevents it from being flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned setting is rich in atmospheric detail—plaster dust, flickering bulbs, bruised receipts—and deeply supports the tone and theme, enhancing the sense of unfiltered human connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a resonant metaphor—receipts as relics of authenticity—paired with fresh literary imagery; the theme of analog truth versus digital noise is subtly but powerfully rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Language is specific, metaphors are fresh (e.g., receipts as prayer flags), and the central idea feels distinctly authored; the tone and imagery avoid cliché and AI patterns with rare elegance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This is a finely crafted piece that thoughtfully integrates its elements into something cohesive, atmospheric, and thematically rich, though one or two linguistic choices border on overwrought.</comment>
