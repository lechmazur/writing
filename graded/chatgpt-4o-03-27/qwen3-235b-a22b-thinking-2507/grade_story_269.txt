<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is deeply intertwined with his identity as a tailor and seeker of transcendence; his emotional depth and fear of the cost provide a rich character portrait, though lacking slightly in specific personal memories or relationships beyond his craft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear arc within tight constraints—beginning in solitude, crescendoing through revelation, and culminating in transformation—though the resolution skirts ambiguity that may frustrate some readers seeking firmer closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly executed with multisensory immersion—steam, brass, ozone, storm—deeply embedding the narrative in a tactile and emotionally resonant steampunk world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vivid symbolism, thematic cohesion, and emotionally resonant prose elevate the narrative's impact; a few abstract moments border on overwrought but mostly avoid indulgent opacity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of metaphor, setting, and theme; some imagery verges on purple, but overall it pushes genre boundaries with purpose and vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive integration of high-concept ideas and emotional stakes; the story feels deliberate, memorable, and strikingly complete for its length.</comment>
