<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivations and emotional arc are clearly rendered, evolving with thematic consistency from control to surrender; his reaction to the bridle and prism reveals layered internal conflict, though his voice veers toward the poetic-universal rather than uniquely personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a coherent and emotionally satisfying arc within tight constraints, with clear progression from illusion to clarity; minor ambiguity in scene transitions blurs some causal links but doesn't derail the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized with rich, immersive sensory detail; atmosphere and tone beautifully support the characterâ€™s transformation, and every element (stone, storm, prism) serves symbolic and narrative functions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic prose, evocative imagery, and strong symbolic resonance create emotional weight and literary depth; the story lingers, though occasional overwriting slightly dulls the pacing and clarity in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking originality and rich metaphorical layers elevate the narrative, but occasional repetition of phrasing and emotional descriptors hint faintly at stylistic overreliance or AI-adjacent rhythm in small stretches.</comment>
