<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard’s characterization as hesitant yet determined with a unique trait (“shyly loud”) is well-executed; his motivations are clear, consistent, and emotionally resonant, though he could use a bit more complexity or conflict beyond his mission.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc—entering the dreamscape, confronting loss, and emerging with hope—is cohesive and well-paced; cause-effect progression flows logically with a satisfying resolution, though some transitions between scenes feel overly smooth or abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The xenon-lit tunnel, dreamscapes, and sensory references create a vivid, immersive world that supports both mood and theme; atmosphere effectively amplifies the fragility of time and the character’s emotional journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional impact through strong imagery and subtle symbolism; the plush, light, and song work together powerfully. However, emotional beats verge on sentimentality at moments, reducing their depth slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While largely fresh and cohesive, some phrasings veer close to poetic cliché, and a few transitions feel too clean—dulling the edge of the rawness. Still, the metaphors and emotional core feel largely earned and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with strong thematic integration and emotional resonance that lingers; the combination of character, object, and method is imaginative and thoughtful, though some execution details feel a touch polished or safe.</comment>
