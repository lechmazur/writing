<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly portrayed as a broken man clinging to fragments of his identity; his motivation is layered and consistent, though secondary characters and dialogue are absent, limiting multidimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc—disgrace, obsession, revelation—is coherent and emotionally satisfying, though the climax feels slightly static for the tension implied by the lab setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is intense and immersive, with the lab’s danger paralleling Silas’s inner turmoil; sensory detail (soot, humming, ozone) is deftly handled and evocative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh perspective on emotional decay and surveillance-era guilt; slightly verges on lyrical excess, but largely avoids formulaic phrasing or cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylistically mature and thematically resonant; not flawless, but remarkably cohesive and emotionally affecting within the word limit.</comment>
