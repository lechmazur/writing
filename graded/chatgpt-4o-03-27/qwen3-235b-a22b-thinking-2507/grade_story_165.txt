<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clearly rooted in her gentle nature and desire for restoration over retribution, aligning well with her actions, but her characterization lacks nuance and personal history that would deepen her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc from inciting incident to emotional resolution, though some transitions—especially the leap from discovery to full garden restoration—feel compressed and overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story crafts a rich, immersive world with evocative sensory detail; the dwarven city and silent forest are atmospheric and thematically resonant, enhancing the overall emotional tone and symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (the butterfly, the reversed messages) and emotional payoff are strong; the story communicates a moving theme of restorative justice, though a touch more subtlety in expression would elevate the craft further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity and emotional closure make the story feel complete and impactful, though slightly more finesse in pacing and restraint in prose would enhance polish and literary readiness.</comment>
