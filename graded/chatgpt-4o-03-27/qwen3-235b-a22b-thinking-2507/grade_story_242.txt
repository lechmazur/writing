<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clearly defined and consistently drives her actions; her evolution from solitary operator to cultural bridge is subtle yet compelling, though her internal voice could be even more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc and a strong emotional resolution, though some moments of transition (e.g. from tailing to alliance) feel slightly condensed or idealized for the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>World-building is richly textured with sensory detail (herbs, phone static, murals); the atmosphere supports the theme of preservation and reconciliation with graceful symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Impressive emotional depth and metaphor (the switchboard as symbolic bridge), with strong use of recurring imagery and an ending that resonates; subtle complexity is handled with finesse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in voice and concept, avoiding clichés; minor hints of stylized repetition slightly weaken authenticity, but overall emotional nuance and subversion of tropes elevate it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story with poetic language, deft pacing, and philosophical undertones; a few moments of over-idealization hold it back from perfect polish.</comment>
