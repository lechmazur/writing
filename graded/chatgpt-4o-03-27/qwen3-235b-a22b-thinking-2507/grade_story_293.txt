<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s nervousness and insincerity are effectively woven into her actions and thoughts; her arc from hesitant performer to purposeful rebel feels emotionally authentic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative builds toward a quiet but decisive climax, with a logical cause-effect movement; however, the pacing risks slight overindulgence in atmospheric buildup at the expense of tension.</comment>
