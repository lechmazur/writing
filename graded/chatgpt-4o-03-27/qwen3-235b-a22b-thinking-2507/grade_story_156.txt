<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s arc from rigid diplomat to transformed participant in communal evolution is powerfully rendered, with her motivations and inner conflict well-aligned to the joyfully tragic resolution. Voice is subtle yet distinct, though not deeply individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure flows organically from collapse to transformation with strong coherence and an effective emotional arc; the liberation of the system mirrors her inner change, though early conflict setup could be sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The salt mine setting is deeply immersive, rich with sensory details that tie directly into theme and tone. Atmosphere and environment are inextricable from the story’s emotional and narrative thrust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The use of poetic imagery, symbolic resonance (birds, salt, breath), and careful subtext carries powerful emotional weight. The ending strikes a strong chord, though the prose occasionally skirts overindulgence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphorical language and unusual narrative devices (holographic birds + salt ecology) offer originality. Slight lapses toward abstract reflection over grounded action prevent a perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; all elements work together toward a unified thematic and tonal resolution. The story feels deliberate rather than constrained by length.</comment>
