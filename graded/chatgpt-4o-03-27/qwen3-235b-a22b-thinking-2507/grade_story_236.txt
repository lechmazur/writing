<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias is richly developed; the meekness never contradicts his emotional resilience. His grief and motivation are deeply integrated, culminating in a believable, poignant decision. Only minor dialogue would deepen him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arc is clean and satisfying within the constraints; the final verification ties past and present well. Slightly dense exposition in the setup marginally slows early pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersiveâ€”sensory details like bioluminescent algae and salt-damaged paper heighten the emotional and physical environment. Exceptionally cohesive setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotionally powerful, symbolically rich, and thematically consistent. The metaphor of generating light from grief is elegant. A touch more subtlety in some phrasing could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original, layered, and emotionally specific. Imagery is fresh. The story resists tropes. Slight poetic density may feel overwrought to some but mostly remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements serve the greater narrative organically. A haunting, resonant conclusion delivers thematic depth. One or two lines verge on purple prose but never tip the balance.</comment>
