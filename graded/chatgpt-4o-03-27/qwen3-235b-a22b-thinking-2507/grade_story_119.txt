<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is convincingly tied to her compassion and survivalist instincts, and her decision to rescue the raccoon deepens her character; however, the "sometimes always" mantra feels tacked-on and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc, coherent tension, and resolution, but the pacing briefly stutters around the raccoon rescue, risking implausibility under time pressure from the hunters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong cohesion among elements with a satisfying resolution and central theme of compassion-driven action, though some thematic aspects feel over-explicit.</comment>
