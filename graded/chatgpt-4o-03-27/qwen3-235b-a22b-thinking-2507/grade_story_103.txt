<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The knight’s inner conflict is deeply human and richly layered; his motivations are both clearly grounded and emotionally resonant, culminating in a powerful, consistent act of self-sacrifice that stems from his core guilt and reluctant compassion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story constructs a complete emotional arc within tight constraints—setup, conflict, and resolution are all present and coherent, though the mirror's mechanics could be slightly clearer without disrupting pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and profoundly integrated—the sensory detail (salt-crusted glass, crashing waves, damp stone) immerses the reader and enhances both tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The emotional intensity is visceral, with elegant symbolism (mirror, light, sea-glass), layered conflict, and a graceful, earned resolution that reflects the story’s central theme with literary finesse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stylistically potent and emotionally nuanced; avoids clichés, and metaphors are both fresh and integral—although "grudgingly sweet" risks mild artificiality in phrasing amid otherwise organic language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A beautifully cohesive and affecting piece with creative use of assigned elements; compelling, emotionally rich, and nearly ready for top-tier publication with only minor refinement.</comment>
