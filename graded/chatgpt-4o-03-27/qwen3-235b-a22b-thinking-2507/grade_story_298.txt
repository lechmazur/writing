<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Li Wei is richly characterized with his duality—rational yet impulsive—consistently influencing his discoveries and performance. His artistic motivations and internal tensions feel emotionally plausible and drive actions organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The structure is tight and purposeful, with a clear arc from discovery to emotional climax. The doll’s dress transitions naturally into the mystery, and the story concludes with a satisfying emotional and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is hauntingly vivid, blending decay and elegance in post-oil collapse. Sensory imagery is deliberate, immersive, and thematically resonant with the character’s emotional landscape and the story’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong literary craft throughout—symbolism (dress, diary), metaphor (sunlight through debris), and thematic depth (truth, memory, performance). The emotional undercurrent remains nuanced rather than overexplained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistently original and avoids formulaic phrasing. Emotion is subtly conveyed through actions and imagery rather than exposition. Some metaphor repetition lightly nudges the boundary of overuse, but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A rich, cohesive piece that integrates its elements seamlessly. It feels more expansive than its length and offers thematic gravity and resonance beyond the immediate plot, with superb tone and inventive framing.</comment>
