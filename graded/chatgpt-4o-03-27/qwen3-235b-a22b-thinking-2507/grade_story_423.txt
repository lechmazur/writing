<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alden’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his reverent actions toward the map and greenhouse reflect his personality well; however, he remains somewhat archetypal and emotionally underdeveloped beyond his mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is efficiently structured with a compelling setup, progression, and resolution; the action of mapping aligns tightly with the story’s logic, though the transition from map activation to understanding could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive setting—desert, aqueduct, and greenhouse are vivid and symbolically rich; atmosphere enhances tone and reinforces themes of memory, decay, and hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compelling and emotionally resonant; all elements work in service of the story, though deeper character insight would elevate it further to top-tier literary standards.</comment>
