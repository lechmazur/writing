<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grandmaster's personality—methodical, obsessive, restrained—emerges clearly through his precise actions and internal quest; however, "delightfully dull" is not fully embodied, leaning more toward enigmatic than dull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story arc is elegantly structured, with a clear beginning, rising tension, and an open-ended but satisfying resolution; strong cause-effect logic, though the tunnel discovery feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is impressively immersive and surreal, with vivid sensory detail and atmosphere that heightens mood and theme; the hydroponic noodle farm is strange yet purposeful in tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism, pacing, and thematic resonance are strong; the story evokes wonder and obsession masterfully, though a touch more human emotion might deepen the central tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is mostly fresh and evocative, though borders on overly ornate in places; the surreal tone generally works but occasionally tiptoes into AI-adjacent abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, richly imagined piece with a singular voice and concept; a few overwrought moments slightly distract from a compelling harmony of form and function.</comment>
