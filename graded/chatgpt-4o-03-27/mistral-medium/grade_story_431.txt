<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dancer’s internal struggle and evolution are deeply felt and consistently reflected in her actions; her transformation from performer to celestial decoder is poignant and well-aligned with her introversion and need for meaning, although slightly more external interaction or tension could further sharpen her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>There is a compelling internal arc—from despair to fragile hope—that creates a satisfying emotional trajectory; however, the absence of concrete external conflict or stakes slightly limits the structural dynamism within the short form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details like "old paper and ozone" and the oppressive wasteland contributing powerfully to the mood and reinforcing character motivation; the cipher decoder’s office effectively anchors the abstract tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The language is lyrical and emotionally resonant, using metaphor and motif (stars, stitching, silence) to deepen theme and mood; while symbolically rich, the story occasionally skirts the edge of over-poetic ambiguity, risking clarity in favor of aesthetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Though abstract and stylized, the story avoids cliché, and its metaphoric use of knitting and stars feels fresh; certain phrases do verge on overwrought, and emotional nuance is mostly internal, but the voice is consistently sensitive and original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This is a cohesive, emotionally textured piece that leaves a meaningful impression; it feels like a complete vision rather than a stitched-together prompt response and demonstrates high creative synthesis of thematic elements.</comment>
