<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The noble's internal crisis and transformation are compelling, but his motivations, though poetic, remain abstract and lack grounding in specific emotional stakes or history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a strong emotional arc but lacks a clear narrative spine; progression is atmospheric rather than plot-driven, making structure feel more symbolic than cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly sensory and thematically aligned—heat, fire, humming, and light reinforce the mood and emotional stakes effectively throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative language and symbolism deepen the theme of truth and transformation, but the story risks melodrama and slight overuse of metaphor where clarity could enhance impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Imagery is often fresh and mood-driven, but some phrases verge on purple prose and a few emotional beats feel performative or inflated rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The piece is atmospheric and thematically resonant, but form occasionally overrides function—more narrative clarity would enhance emotional payoff without dulling poetic intensity.</comment>
