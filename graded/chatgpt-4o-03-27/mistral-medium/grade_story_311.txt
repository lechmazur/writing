<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonistâ€™s motivation to break free is clear and consistently reinforced through his actions and reflections; however, his voice lacks some distinctive nuance, and emotional depth is too restrained given the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc is complete and coherent with a satisfying resolution, though the transition from internal desire to decisive action happens quickly and risks undermining realism in pacing and tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lunar setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail; the greenhouse offers potent contrast to the sterile base, enhancing thematic resonance and emotional depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly cohesive narrative with strong thematic unity and satisfying closure; imaginative use of setting and object enriches style, though minor tonal flattening in midsection hinders full emotional impact.</comment>
