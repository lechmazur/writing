<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motivations are conceptually strong—driven by loss and desperation—but his emotional depth feels underdeveloped; his voice lacks specificity and nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure is mostly cohesive and achieves a full arc, yet some narrative leaps (like the twin dissolving) lack clarity, weakening internal logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh in places, but some phrasing feels generically “mythic” or overly ornate; narrative relies on conventional tropes with only partial subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing and stylistically rich, but suffers from occasional vagueness and a lack of grounding detail to balance abstraction with emotional immediacy.</comment>
