<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The caretaker’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his solemnly silly nature is reflected in the whimsical yet meaningful use of the plastic straw—however, deeper emotional complexity or backstory is lacking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is complete within the word limit, and the final resolution is satisfying, but the middle drifts slightly into poetic abstraction, which weakens narrative drive and temporal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and vividly rendered, with excellent integration of tone, object, and atmosphere—the geothermal-ice harmony is conceptually rich and emotionally resonant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some phrasing borders on purple prose and the tone verges on overly ethereal at times, but the imagery is mostly fresh, and emotion is often shown through setting and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic coherence and emotional tone; each element contributes meaningfully, though the narrative risks being too abstract for broader readership without a clearer emotional anchor.</comment>
