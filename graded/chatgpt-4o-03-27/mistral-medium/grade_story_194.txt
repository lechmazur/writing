<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn with consistent motivations tied to his past and his quest for healing; his emotional evolution and tension with the letter deepen his characterization, though his "gracefully awkward" trait could be more vividly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves a full arc and maintains cohesion with poetic pacing, though some transitions—especially involving the healer—feel slightly abrupt; the narrative flow occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric, rich in sensory detail, and deeply entwined with tone and theme; the ossuary-restaurant is both original and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, using symbolism and lyrical language well; certain metaphors verge on overwrought, slightly diluting otherwise strong impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Displays a unique blend of poetic language and surreal imagery; a few moments hint at formulaic transitions, but overall highly original with fresh metaphors and strong stylistic control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally affecting, and stylistically distinct; not flawless in pacing or clarity, but succeeds as a complete and memorable literary work within its constraints.</comment>
