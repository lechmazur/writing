<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s superstition and desire to transcend are sketched but lack full psychological depth or evolution; his inner voice is distant despite poetic trappings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a dreamlike arc with beginning, middle, and end, but its coherence slightly suffers under the abstract execution; transitions are smooth but sometimes opaque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in the caves and storm; the atmosphere supports tone and action powerfully, enhancing the mystical mood and reinforcing theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphor and cyclical structure; emotionally resonant yet veers toward the esoteric, which may limit universal impact; ending is poetic and fitting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong originality and voice lift the story above cliché, though some images feel overly stylized; emotional nuance present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Overall a compelling, lyrical piece with a strong thematic arc and atmospheric design; tighter focus on character intimacy would elevate it further.</comment>
