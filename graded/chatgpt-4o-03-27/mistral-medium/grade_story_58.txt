<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias has a compelling internal arc, but his transformation lacks grounding; the scout identity is more told than shown, and motivation shifts feel abstract rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc and satisfying resolution within its length, but cause-effect dynamics, particularly involving the journal and moths, are heavily symbolic and occasionally opaque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with effective sensory detail and tone; the tower and storm interplay beautifully, though "moth observation tower" strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The metaphor of storm-as-self is sustained with poetic control and emotional weight; subtext and symbolism succeed, though some phrasing veers toward overwritten abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Inventive in concept, but the phrasing occasionally lapses into poetic vagueness; “coded nonsense in comedic routines” isn’t integrated clearly, weakening authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story fuses strong atmosphere with a unique transformation arc, though some assigned elements feel forced or underexplored, keeping it just short of elite readiness.</comment>
