<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchardist’s motivation—solving his wife's death—is clear and consistent, and his personality (sardonic, precise, emotional beneath restraint) is effectively conveyed through voice and action. However, more emotional interiority or subtle shifts in his character would elevate the depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a strong arc within tight constraints and has a clear beginning, buildup, climax, and resolution. However, the connection between the peacock-based method and the conspiracy is a bit strained, weakening coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sterile facility sets a strong atmospheric contrast with the organic symbolism of peacocks and seals. While the mood is intriguing and textured, more sensory detail and environmental interaction could deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (peacock feathers as encoded truth) is inventive and emotionally resonant. The ending delivers purpose and closure. Some emotional beats feel more told than shown, but poetic language strengthens the overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core metaphor is fresh and layered, but some phrasing edges toward overly ornate or repetitious (“the patterns didn’t lie,” “seal glinting”). The writing avoids clichés and maintains consistent tone, though slight AI-pattern echoes remain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Despite the density of required elements, the story feels cohesive and character-driven. The integration of grief, espionage, and natural symbol systems is original. A few conceptual links could be clarified for full clarity and emotional payoff.</comment>
