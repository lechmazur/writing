<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eliasâ€™ motivations are clear and emotionally resonant; the relationship between his melancholy, his pride, and the lullabies adds depth, though his development leans on lyrical tone rather than dynamic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc under tight constraints; Elias' journey and the symbolic resolution at the orchard are coherent, though the pacing of external conflict (with the dealer) feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and impactful, with strong thematic unity and emotional weight; style is elevated, though at times it skirts over-ornamentation.</comment>
