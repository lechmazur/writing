<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias is emotionally resonant and consistent, but "lukewarm mage" lacks specific expression in action or internal development; magic is metaphorical rather than character-defining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>There’s a clear arc and emotional resolution, but narrative momentum is low—the central action (clash) is largely symbolic and lacks concrete stakes or causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar base is evocatively rendered with sensory and thematic depth; setting and atmosphere powerfully support mood and character emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegiac tone and strong symbolism elevate the story, but literary devices verge on overwrought at times, and the emotional payoff is subtle rather than powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, unique tone, and emotional nuance shine; some phrasing edges toward ornamental, but overall the story avoids formulaic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive, thematically resonant, and quietly affecting; lacks clarity in the magical elements and stakes, which slightly limits overall impact.</comment>
