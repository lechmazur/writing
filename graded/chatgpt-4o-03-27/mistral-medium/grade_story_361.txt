<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is convincingly portrayed as a quiet, thoughtful character shaped by duty and reverence; his motivation is consistent and his actions—especially the final choice—reflect his personality, though his voice could be more distinctive in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear narrative arc with strong cause-effect relationships, and the twist of the archive beneath the diner is effective—though the stakes are suggested rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative feels cohesive and thematically resonant, with a satisfying resolution and clear depth, though it just misses the exceptional polish required for top-tier publication.</comment>
