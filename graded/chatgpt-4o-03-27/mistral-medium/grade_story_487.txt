<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bruiser is economically yet effectively drawn—his stoicism and physical presence reinforce his internal calm and purpose; his motivation aligns well, though the lack of dialogue limits fuller dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative has a clear arc: journey, discovery, transformation. The pacing is well-handled, but the treasure map subplot feels slightly underutilized and rushed in execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich; the elements feel chosen to serve a vision rather than checklist fulfillment. Leaves lasting impression with myth-making and rebirth arc.</comment>
