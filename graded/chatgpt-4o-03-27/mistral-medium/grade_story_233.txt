<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner’s naivety is clearly central to her motivation and actions, but her interiority lacks depth; we see belief, but not enough individuality or evolution within the piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story builds well to a resolution and maintains narrative coherence; the arc is compressed but satisfying. Slight repetition and vagueness around the ritual’s mechanics undermine clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with rich sensory details and thematic alignment between setting, tone, and action; however, the “virtual” element remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphor enrich the emotional core. The story resonates, though it edges toward overwriting at times and could benefit from sharper, more distilled moments of subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While many lines are lyrically strong, some phrasing leans generic or abstract, and the “seeds of understanding” metaphor lacks specificity. The prose occasionally skirts into overly poetic vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative feels cohesive and emotionally resonant. It balances mystical elements with human longing, though a few components feel symbolic rather than fully integrated.</comment>
