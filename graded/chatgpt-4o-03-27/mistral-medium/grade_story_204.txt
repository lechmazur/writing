<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena's arc is emotionally resonant and grounded in a core internal conflict—her shift from aversion to embrace of intangible connection is well-executed; however, her profession as a cuddler feels underutilized as a source of deeper insight or contrast.</comment>
