<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The smuggler is intriguingly layered, and his internal conflict comes through, but his core motivation for mastering empathy feels underdeveloped and more conceptual than emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arc is poetic but abstract; cause-effect logic is looser than ideal. Some moments feel emotionally resonant, but structural clarity suffers from thematic vagueness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, with strong sensory detail and tonal resonance. The center feels surreal and rich, enhancing the emotional undercurrent. Still, more specificity in the setting would heighten realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Excellent command of metaphor and symbolism with emotional resonance. The butterfly motif and storm prediction elevate the subtext, though some passages edge toward lyrical excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality is present in imagery and tone, but occasional vagueness and slightly overwritten phrasing suggest moments of mechanical lyricism or thematic padding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overall a haunting, thought-provoking piece with artistry, though it lacks some narrative clarity and sharpness to be immediately ready for top-tier publication.</comment>
