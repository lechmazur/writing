<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias is distinct with a well-established voice and motivation, but some emotional responses—especially the truce—feel too convenient and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot maintains forward momentum and resolves cleanly, but the climax feels slightly rushed and thematically overwritten given the limited space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory language, though some futuristic elements (e.g., "electronic wilderness refuge") remain abstract and underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful within constraints, but lacks surprise or deeply etched originality to stand out in elite literary circles.</comment>
