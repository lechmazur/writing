<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is richly rendered with a convincingly conflicted emotional arc; his journey from storm chaser to builder is subtle but clear, though the "eagerly unwilling" trait is a bit underdefined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is cohesive and satisfying, with a clear emotional pivot and resolution; pacing is well-managed, but the cause-effect between tapestry and carousel could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is compelling and immersive, with strong sensory detail (pine, snow, stone); the monastery reinforces Elias’s transformation and contrasts well with the desert past.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor and symbolism (carousel, tongs, storm) are evocative; emotional weight is effectively carried without overstatement; ending lands with resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché and maintains a poetic but clear style; some phrases verge on lyrical excess, but overall the writing feels intentional and uniquely voiced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, layered story that demonstrates thoughtful integration of theme, character, and setting; the story lingers emotionally despite constraints.</comment>
