<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mercenary's motivation is clearly tied to his brother and the amber, and his actions are consistent with that past burden; however, his voice and inner world are slightly underdeveloped given the rich symbolic framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-contained within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the resolution ties back effectively to the introduced elements; a few leaps in logic slightly challenge suspension of disbelief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and richly symbolic, with tactile, auditory, and visual details creating a compelling, immersive, and metaphoric atmosphere integral to tone and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional impact through rich imagery and strong symbolic motifs; its subtext on grief, memory, and transformation is effective, though the theme edges close to overwrought if not carefully read.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Most metaphors feel earned and original, with nuanced emotion and few lapses into vague abstraction; some repetition and slightly hazy execution of "improbable rumor chain" weakens originality slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Each component supports the narrative rather than feeling imposed, and the overall result is a strong, reflective piece that lingers; minor unevenness in clarity and cohesion keeps it from full mastery.</comment>
