<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally original use of craft and mythic elements with a fresh arc, though “scent of the book” and the centaur moment verge on fantasy convention without full reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant story that lingers after reading; tightened phrasing and more stylistic risk-taking could push it from excellent to exceptional.</comment>
