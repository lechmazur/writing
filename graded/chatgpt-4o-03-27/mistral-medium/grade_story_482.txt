<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and driven, his insomnia and obsessive need for truth underpinning his motivations clearly; however, interiority could be more deeply developed in certain moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc from obsession to catharsis is complete and coherent, though some transitions—especially the villagers’ implied reaction—are rushed or overly implied due to space constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The surreal, fungal setting is richly atmospheric and saturated with sensory detail that supports tone and character mood exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and symbolic imagery, especially in the portrait and bioluminescent elements; a few phrases veer toward overwriting but are mostly effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imaginative and evocative, though a few moments flirt with purple prose or overly ornate language that blurs clarity rather than deepens meaning; overall emotional resonance is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive integration of theme, atmosphere, and personal stakes; the story feels cohesive and complete, though a slightly cleaner tension-resolution flow would elevate it.</comment>
