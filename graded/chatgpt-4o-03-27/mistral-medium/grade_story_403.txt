<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The knight's motivation is clearly stated and emotionally resonant, and his actions (seclusion, reading aloud) align well with his desire to escape perception's limits; however, without dialogue or dynamic interaction, his personality feels somewhat abstracted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc, strong progression, and satisfying resolution; cause and effect are mostly strong, though the middle risks slight repetition and abstraction that could lessen momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating library is richly constructed with immersive imagery and layered atmosphere that enhances character and theme; tone and setting are tightly interwoven and transportive.</comment>
