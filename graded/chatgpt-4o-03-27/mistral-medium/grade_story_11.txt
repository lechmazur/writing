<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cartographer’s motivations are consistent and well-rooted in his persona; his internal conflict is clear and emotionally resonant, though his ‘flightiness’ could be developed with more dimension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc, with clear setup, tension, and resolution; however, certain transitions—especially the theft—feel slightly rushed or under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with sensory-rich detail; the setting enhances tone and mood excellently, though the larger world remains somewhat abstracted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrent and effective symbolism; the conflict is tightly woven into the narrative, but the ending gesture, while poetic, stops just short of profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotionally layered with original phrasing and imagery; stylistic flourishes generally serve the tone, though a few lines verge on melodramatic repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, stylistically purposeful piece that balances theme, plot, and mood well; not quite exceptional, but certainly distinguished and close to publication-ready.</comment>
