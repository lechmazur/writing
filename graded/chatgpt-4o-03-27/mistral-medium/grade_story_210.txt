<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scholar’s motivation is strongly aligned with his actions and persona—his amiability and intellectual drive come through clearly. His choice to delay personal gain for historical truth adds complexity, but his "voice" could be more distinct for excellence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arc is emotionally and thematically resolved, and the plot flows logically. However, the forward movement is subtle, relying more on atmosphere than clear action, which dulls narrative tension slightly within the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting and sensory details are highly immersive—timbers creaking, light flickering, shadows whispering—all skillfully enhance theme and tone to evoke a vivid, haunted atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical and thematic layering—particularly the crossword as bridge—but some repetition and slight over-reliance on poetic abstraction weakens impact. Emotion is evoked, but with less precision than ideal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and its motifs (crossword, signal room, ghosts) feel integrated. Some metaphors verge on overwrought or slightly mechanical, but language is mostly purposeful with flashes of originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story lingers due to the emotional payoff and symbolic conclusion. Despite the introspective pace, the cohesion between character, setting, and theme is notable—even if the execution isn’t flawless.</comment>
