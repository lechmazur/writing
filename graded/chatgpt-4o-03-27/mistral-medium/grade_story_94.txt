<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lena’s motivations are poetic but somewhat abstract; her inner conflict is compelling, yet her emotional evolution feels more symbolic than lived-through.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has an arc and resolution, but narrative momentum is minimal—events feel metaphorical rather than driven by clear action or consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative and immersive, with strong mood and sensory detail that reinforce the thematic tone of longing and reflection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Symbolism is rich and the ending resonates emotionally, but ambiguity in what’s at stake blunts dramatic urgency; lacks memorable dramatic conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original metaphors and elegant prose shine, but some repetition of imagery (cloud trails, longing) borders on formulaic abstraction without deeper revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stylistically polished and thematically coherent, though feels slightly overwritten and more mood-piece than story; emotional impact lingers but lacks punch.</comment>
