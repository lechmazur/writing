<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivations are resonant and emotionally grounded, but his personality and transformation—while poetic—lack the specificity and depth to truly elevate him beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arc is emotionally coherent and flows well, with logical cause-effect sequencing, but the central plot feels more like a tone piece than a narrative with true momentum or stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking use of imagery and metaphor, and a lyrical tone that evokes emotion, but ambiguity sometimes borders on vagueness, weakening the thematic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Some turns of phrase are overly ornate and familiar ("whispered prayers to the wind"), with occasional defaults to poetic generalities rather than fresh, precise imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Beautifully rendered and emotionally evocative, though slightly too reliant on atmosphere over narrative uniqueness; the combination of elements shows skillful intent.</comment>
