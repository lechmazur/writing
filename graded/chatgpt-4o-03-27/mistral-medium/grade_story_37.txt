<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character is clearly motivated by seeking redemption, and his internal transformation is effectively portrayed through symbolic and emotional touches, especially the use of the sheet music; however, some nuances in his voice and deeper psychological layers are only lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional direction, with effective pacing within the word limit; a few transitions (e.g., from waiting room to resolution) feel slightly too symbolic and could benefit from sharper narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is vividly evoked with sensory detail and metaphor, effectively mirroring the character's emotional journey; the contrast between setting and waiting room deepens the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical prose and metaphorical layering are strong, with resonant symbolism centered on music and transformation; some sentences edge into slight overstatement, risking clarity for poeticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional and thematic payoff, weaving the elements into a coherent and stylistically ambitious narrative, though it verges at points on over-stylization.</comment>
