<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The character's motivations and internal arc are consistent, and his curiosity and transformation are convincingly portrayed, though his "pleasantly troublesome" nature could be shown more through action than implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear internal arc with resolution, using the scrimshaw and dancer effectively to chart the wanderer's journey, though the transition from mystery to revelation happens quickly and could benefit from more tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered and atmospheric, actively supporting the character's inner journey and symbolic reflectionâ€”setting and tone are immersive and elegantly integrated.</comment>
