<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias and Mara's motivations are thematically coherent and compelling, though Mara remains more a symbol than a fully realized person. Elias carries the emotional weight, but his character arc could use sharper definition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story successfully completes a narrative arc within the word limit, with clear direction and climax, but the middle feels slightly ethereal and vague in motivation mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmospheric imagery is striking and immersive—icy metaphors and mechanical decay powerfully convey a unique world that enhances tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance and poetic prose, though at times abstraction dilutes tension; emotion is shown well through motif and setting, but dialogue use is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Notably original fusion of language preservation and speculative setting; metaphors are fresh though sometimes verge on opaque or overwrought, risking clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant story with elegant motif execution and stylistic unity—though some abstraction weakens immediacy and character connection.</comment>
