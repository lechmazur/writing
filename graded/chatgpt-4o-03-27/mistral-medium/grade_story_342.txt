<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias is internally rich, and his arc from detachment to purpose shows clear evolution, but his identity as a "careless pilot" is underdeveloped and never meaningfully integrated into actions or imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot unfolds coherently and concludes with thematic resolution, though the ease of the transformation lessens tension; the structure handles introspection well within the word limit.</comment>
