<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is convincingly rendered with consistent internal conflict, a clear emotional arc, and a thoughtful resolution that aligns with his motivations and past; his voice is distinct, though it leans toward reflective over visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed within the word limit, with a beginning, turning point, and resolution centered on internal reckoning; however, the analysis of the flute feels slightly underdeveloped as a method of action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric with sensory details and metaphorical resonance; the mountains and gondola deepen the mood and thematic weight, strengthening the introspective journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with layered imagery, subtext, and symbolism; the emotional depth and resolution feel earned, though the central method could be more convincing in execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of theme, character, and imagery in a compact structure; the story is emotionally resonant and stylistically polished, though the method feels symbol-heavy rather than plot-driving.</comment>
