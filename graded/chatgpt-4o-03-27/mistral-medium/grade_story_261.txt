<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard keeper’s immortality is reflected with poetic gravity through his ritualistic sketches and resigned determination; his motivations are oblique but coherent, though a deeper emotional arc would elevate his complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot is more cyclical than linear, evoking a haunting repetition; it coheres thematically but lacks conventional structure—there is no clear resolution, which suits the tone but limits narrative satisfaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance, a bleak emotional core, and lyrical prose drive impact; yet its abstract nature and lack of clear conflict may limit broader emotional accessibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original vision, striking imagery, and inventive conceptual blending distinguish this piece; only slight lapses into poetic abstraction hinder universal clarity and emotional depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive, poignant, and stylistically confident; while some elements read as ornamental, the whole achieves a melancholic cohesion that lingers—nearly journal-ready with refinement.</comment>
