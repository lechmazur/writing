<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s internal conflict is clear and thematically effective, but his motivations—though stated—lack dynamism or progression; he remains largely static in emotional texture, limiting full development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves thematic closure but lacks narrative propulsion; reliance on introspective beats causes the story to feel contemplative rather than evolving, with the handshake as the only major event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple setting is richly atmospheric and effectively mirrors Elias’s inner landscape; sensory details like incense and shadows contribute to a moody, immersive tone relevant to his arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism and thematic layering well (constellations, ink blotter), but repetition and lack of narrative variance dilute emotional punch; more contrast or escalation would heighten impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Inventive metaphors and tone lend texture, but occasional overwriting and reliance on familiar tropes (e.g., shadowy deal, inner doubt) reduce uniqueness; language verges on ornate at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is thematically rich and stylistically competent, but constrained by repetitious introspection and a lack of dynamic narrative movement; effective emotional arc, yet subdued.</comment>
