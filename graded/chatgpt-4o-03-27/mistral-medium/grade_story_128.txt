<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story arc is mostly well-contained with a clear beginning, rising action, and resolution; the "veer" provides a strong narrative hinge, though some transitions near the middle feel overly symbolic and abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept feels fresh and the metaphor of unfiltered sight via stories is compelling, but some phrasing is overly ornate and leans slightly toward poetic generality over specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and memorable, with a meaningful transformation; a slightly stronger emotional connection to the protagonist’s personal stakes would raise it further.</comment>
