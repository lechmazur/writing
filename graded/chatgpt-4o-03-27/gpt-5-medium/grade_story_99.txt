<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character has a rich interiority and a distinct, poetic presence—his traits align with his actions and voice, though some aspects (e.g., emotional stakes) remain implied more than developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arc is lyrical but abstract; there's progression and resolution, yet the story leans more on mood than causality, which slightly diminishes structural clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is haunting, immersive, and deeply metaphorical; sensory details and symbolic echoes support mood and theme beautifully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memorable and poetic; strong thematic unity, though a touch more grounding in the character's personal stakes would have elevated its impact.</comment>
