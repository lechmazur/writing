<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The necromancer is a fully realized character whose meekness and sincerity permeate every action—from humble trades to his emotional pursuit of meaning. His motivations feel genuine, consistent, and thematically rich, though his inner conflict could be slightly more complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot forms a gentle, coherent arc with a satisfying resolution. The pacing is masterfully subdued, but the action remains internal and meditative, which may limit urgency for some readers in a competitive market.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is richly layered and immersive—pipes, roots, dew, bazaar sounds—all rendered through vivid, specific sensory detail. It perfectly amplifies the story’s tone and supports character and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The symbolism of dew, shadow, and broken pen is handled with rare finesse. Subtext is deep and the language poetic without overreaching. A clearer emotional climax would elevate it to perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("vial of morning," "mural of roots") and emotional nuance avoid cliché. A few moments edge toward over-poetic abstraction, but the story overall carries an unmistakable authorial voice and originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive piece where every element serves a unified vision. The brevity feels intentional, the tone consistent. Left a resonant emotional impression and thematic clarity uncommon in short fiction.</comment>
