<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct and compelling voice enhanced by their "uniquely literal" nature, which informs perspective and decisions. The master-apprentice dynamic and the narrator’s calm detachment create layered motivations, though emotional depth could be more fully developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is poetic yet cohesive, with progression from apprentice routine to revelation and cosmic accounting. The resolution is subtle but effective, though some transitions verge on abstract, almost lyrical at the cost of grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive—wrought in sensory detail, mood, and metaphor. The lighthouse as a living memory device and atmospheric anchor is masterful, enhancing tone and theme without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story’s lyrical prose, evocative imagery, and layered metaphors yield a haunting emotional resonance. Subtext about ecological collapse, technological ghosts, and cosmic debt deepens re-read value.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, metaphors fresh, and narrative avoids cliché. A few phrasings—"smelled like storms," "tasted like salt"—risk repetition, but overall the piece maintains originality and a human poetic texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegantly interwoven elements produce a coherent, high-concept narrative. Form supports theme, and the story lingers through potent sensory and philosophical aftertaste.</comment>
