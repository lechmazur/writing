<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrator possesses a strong voice and distinct intention, but emotional depth and clear evolution are muted; the advisor, while evocative, lacks dimensional motivation or development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The structure leans poetic and episodic over plot-driven clarity; while atmosphere is immersive, narrative causality is obscured and lacks clear escalation or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and richly sensory; metaphorical descriptions of time, fence, orchard, and sky build a layered, imaginative world with tonal coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original execution with metaphorical ingenuity and subverted tropes; slight risk of overwritten moments, but overall feels human, not algorithmic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive with layered meaning and emotional aftertaste; lacks a traditional arc but succeeds as literary meditation grounded in imaginative fusion.</comment>
