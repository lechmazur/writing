<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct voice and compelling motivation rooted in guilt and familial love; their actions—both scientific and surreal—align with their burdened sense of duty, though emotional depth is slightly veiled by poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot coheres beautifully despite complexity, with a clear arc from underwater labor to metaphorical and literal transcendence; pacing is elegantly managed though occasional surreal leaps may challenge coherence for some.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is astonishingly vivid and original, underwater atmosphere suffused with tension and melancholy; sensory and symbolic elements like algae-written formulas and drowned stamps deepen immersion masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is deeply affecting and rich in metaphor, with layered subtext linking time, memory, and loss; its surreal elements serve emotional rather than decorative purpose, though a clearer emotional climax might enhance impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, evocative whole that combines disparate elements in a seamless, imaginative way; leaves a resonant emotional aftermath without didacticism, and feels fully realized despite brevity.</comment>
