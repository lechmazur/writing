<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator possesses a distinct, compelling voice infused with contradictions—fervent apathy, poetic intuition—that align with their actions and motivations; some emotional beats (e.g., the relationship with the child) feel slightly rushed but are resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arc achieves clarity and payoff within constraints, with a mysterious breadcrumb trail leading to a satisfying emotional conclusion; the marble-map method is strained, but transitions remain smooth and cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sensory-rich cyberpunk setting is vividly realized, reinforcing tone and character ethos; metaphoric and literal atmospheres (neon, rain, machinery) are immersive and integral rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story balances lyricism with narrative momentum, using metaphor and symbolism to amplify emotional stakes; the ending evokes warmth and quiet triumph without resorting to sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imagery is mostly fresh and effective, though occasionally flirts with purple prose; metaphors maintain originality and thematic weight, with minimal formulaic phrasing or AI-like artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesion, tone, and poetic risk-taking all support a resonant narrative that feels deliberate rather than constrained by form; the story lingers afterward, inviting reread and reflection.</comment>
