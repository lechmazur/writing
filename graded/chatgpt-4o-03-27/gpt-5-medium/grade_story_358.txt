<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mage’s motivation is enigmatic but compelling—his actions are consistent with his mystical persona, and the interaction with the child adds depth. However, internal development is minimal beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves rare coherence for its surreal tone; the arc from appearance to riddle to opening the portal resolves satisfyingly, though pacing is dense due to lyricism and abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is richly symbolic and thematically layered, eliciting awe and reflection; metaphor and imagery are tightly controlled but border on overripe in places, risking alienation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shows strong stylistic identity and expressive originality; metaphors are specific and strange. Avoids cliché. A few flourishes verge on overuse, but emotional nuance is present and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unified vision, luminous prose, and inventive concept elevate the piece well above standard; it lingers in the mind. Minor clarity trade-offs prevent a perfect score.</comment>
