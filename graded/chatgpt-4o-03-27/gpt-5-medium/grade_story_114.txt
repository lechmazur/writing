<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct, consistent voice shaped by their "enthusiastic laziness," and motivation to rebuild coral reefs is subtly yet powerfully driven by small, deliberate actions—but the internal arc is more tonal than developmental.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot flows organically, with a steady, meditative progression; it achieves completion through tonal resolution rather than traditional narrative arc—elegant but slightly opaque for mainstream comprehension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmospheric details and tactile metaphors ground the surreal setting; the world-building is poetic yet coherent within its internal rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative prose, layered symbolism (e.g., river wisdom, coral as restored rhythm), and a resonant emotional undertone elevate storytelling; emotional weight is substantial though subtle, leaning on style more than conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice and metaphoric precision; metaphors are fresh, resonant, and consistently purposeful—this feels authorial, not formulaic or AI-generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive, conceptually rich, and emotionally textured; minor clarity issues in narrative sequence prevent a perfect score, but it lingers powerfully post-read.</comment>
