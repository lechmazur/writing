<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is strong and distinct, with motivation—seeking beauty in unexpected places—deeply interwoven into action and observation; while subtle in arc, the emotional and psychological depth compensates for minimal external change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is exquisitely realized—atmospheric, immersive, and symbolically rich; sensory details evoke a dreamlike melancholia perfectly aligned with the narrator’s internal world and motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lyrical language, metaphoric density, and symbolic structure create a resonant, haunting narrative; though elliptical at times, the motif of memory and preservation threads through effectively, ending on an evocative image that lingers.</comment>
