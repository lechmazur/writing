<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character is richly developed—his emotional arc from violence to humility is earned, consistent, and layered with symbolic detail that deepens rather than explains.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc and satisfying resolution; a few transitions feel slightly abstract, softening cause-effect clarity, but overall it coheres remarkably well given complexity and brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is haunting and textured—setting and sensory elements (hum, smells, dust, warmth) work harmoniously with emotion and theme, creating potent immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors, thematic resonance, and elegant symbolism generate deep emotional impact—“burned pans,” "moths of paperwork" are particularly memorable literary devices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original execution; rare metaphors, genre subversion, and emotional nuance signal authorial voice, though one or two phrasings edge toward poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>All elements feel intentionally interwoven, and the story lingers after reading—stylistically bold yet admirably restrained in sentimentality; nearly publish-ready.</comment>
