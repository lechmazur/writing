<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent; their motivation to defy fatalism and rewrite futures aligns with their rebellious nature. However, there is limited emotional range or evolution over the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is dreamlike but structurally coherent, with a clear arc of discovery, revelation, and resistance. Still, the symbolic intensity occasionally threatens narrative clarity and momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and inventive; the concept feels organically interwoven rather than imposed. Thought-provoking and emotionally charged, though perhaps a touch too abstract for some readers.</comment>
