<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The monarch's motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices—carrying mismatched puzzle pieces and using feathers to perceive—align with her cautious, wisdom-driven personality; though introspective, the character is vivid and distinct within the constraints.</comment>
