<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s voice is distinct and consistent, with motivations (rediscovering a lost family legacy through recipe lore) deeply tied to their aristocratic ruin; while not deeply explored psychologically, the emotional through-line is strong and internally coherent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot builds logically, moving from premise through surreal progression to resolution; it maintains structural coherence under heavy metaphor, though the emotional climax is more atmospheric than narratively sharp.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is richly textured and thematically resonant; sensory details (smells of rosemary, ink vines climbing, parallel tracks) saturate the setting in mood and metaphor—nearly flawless atmosphere creation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly poetic and symbol-laden prose with carefully constructed subtext about family, loss, and identity; the storytelling is emotionally resonant and stylistically ambitious, occasionally overstepping into floridness but largely effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The style is distinctive and fresh, mythic yet grounded; metaphors are original and rarely feel ornamental—the surreal tone enhances rather than flattens human emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally textured; high-concept elements are expertly unified, and it lingers with philosophical weight without over-explaining.</comment>
