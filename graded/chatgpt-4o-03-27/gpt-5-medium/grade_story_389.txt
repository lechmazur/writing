<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The warlock's behavior, motivations, and rituals are consistent and vividly rendered; his obsession with knowledge and methodical demeanor give depth, though he remains more archetype than deeply humanized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is more atmospheric than event-driven, but within the vignette structure, the arc from arrival to communion with the library and departure is coherent; still, it lacks a strong turning point or emotional shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through the unusual premise, fresh metaphors, and precise vocabulary that avoids cliché; the voice is distinctive and not easily machine-parsable, though at times verges on overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, lyrical, and brimming with ideas—while light on traditional conflict, it reads as a deliberate poetic meditation on forgotten knowledge and the rituals of rediscovery.</comment>
