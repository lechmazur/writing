<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is poetically rendered and deeply tied to her backstory and personality traits, creating a clear, consistent voice; her emotional stakes and actions (memorizing, stitching corals) align powerfully with her driving need for atonement and connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure has a quiet arc shaped by image and motif rather than traditional plot; while subtle, it coherently progresses from shame to healing, though the lack of clear inciting event or external stakes may slightly undercut narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive, layered with tactile and emotional detail; sensory language is vivid and unique, with coral restoration and family memory blending seamlessly into a haunting, echo-filled atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotion and theme are woven expertly through symbol and imagery; the storytelling is lyrical and layered, with metaphoric resonance (coral stitching, vintage tools) supporting an affecting meditation on healing and inherited silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors and specific imagery avoid clich√©, and voice is consistently human and stylistically distinct; a couple lines verge on overwritten, but overall the prose feels intentional and fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with elegant cohesion; despite dense metaphor, the story achieves emotional clarity and leaves a haunting impression of transformation grounded in poetic realism.</comment>
