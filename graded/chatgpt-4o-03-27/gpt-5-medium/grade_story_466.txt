<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s morally ambiguous, poetic voice is vivid and holds consistent; motivations—both personal and existential—are nuanced and evolve around the decoding act. However, emotional depth remains abstract rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot unfolds lyrically but risks opacity; while a thematic arc exists, the narrative arc wavers slightly in coherence, with small jumps between scenes. The beginning and end align symbolically, though the middle stretches plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world is richly immersive, full of tactile sensory cues and layered metaphor—singed thyme, groaning towers, smoke grids—beautifully supporting the mood and theme. Atmosphere is a major strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is memorable, stylistically bold, and rich in metaphor and subtext. It evokes curiosity and quiet awe, though a more tangible emotional arc could elevate its resonance. The ending is subtle but impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original voice and metaphors with strong symbolic cohesion. Occasional poetic density borders on purple, but the language serves the theme. No sign of formulaic or AI-generic constructs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This is literary, ambitious, and remarkably cohesive given its complexity. Despite some abstraction, the craft and control demonstrate near-publishable strength in elite venues.</comment>
