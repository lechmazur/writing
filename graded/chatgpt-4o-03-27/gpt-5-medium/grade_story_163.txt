<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator conveys a distinct, emotionally resonant arc—her identity as a lost heiress becomes a lens through which her motivations and contradictions surface clearly, although Iri's depth could be more developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative achieves impressive coherence and complexity within the short form, with layered callbacks and motif recurrence; a few transitions approach opacity but resolve into meaning on rereading.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s world is immersive and imagistic, with the research station and the scenic overlook rendered as liminal spaces mirroring internal change; sensory detail is elegant, not overbearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor, symbolism, and theme; the prose is lyrical without being overwrought, and the ending delivers emotional and philosophical resonance rare in flash fiction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The language is strikingly original, especially in image and metaphor, though echoes of AI patterning occur in minor lexical redundancy (e.g., "reckless precision" appears thrice too pointedly).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An elegant, stylistically confident piece with thematic depth and conceptual ambition; it coheres with poetic logic and leaves a lasting emotional and intellectual impression.</comment>
