<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct, consistent voice and believable inner life; his conscientious objector past shapes his present motives and actions, especially his passive observational role, but some emotional depths could be more developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure is lyrical rather than plot-driven; while the arc is coherent in mood and theme, the story lacks a strong central event or climax to ground the progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ravine-hung orchard, storm atmosphere, and sensory cues create a richly immersive setting that deeply harmonizes with tone, character, and themes of memory and migration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent use of poetic imagery, layered symbolism (lanterns, routes, nail), and subtext about guardianship and passive resistance; ends with resonant thematic clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking originality and depth of metaphor throughout; tone is subtly controlled, though a few repetitions and overly ornate images risk veering toward preciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive, expressive, and thematically rich; the elements serve a unified narrative that lingers, though its elliptical nature may dampen tension for some readers.</comment>
