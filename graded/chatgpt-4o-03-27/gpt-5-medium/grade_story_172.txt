<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator’s motivations are compelling and consistent, especially their tension with the idea of leading others astray or toward safety; however, emotional depth could be sharpened, and the pilgrim remains more symbolic than dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with an effective midpoint (unlocking the puzzle) and a surreal but emotionally satisfying resolution; a minor drawback is the obscured timeline and slight abstraction in cause-effect beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally provocative; a few abstract elements may alienate less attentive readers, but the ambition and impact are unmistakable.</comment>
