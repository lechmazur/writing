<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prince's quest for a cure for loneliness is clearly defined and consistent; his emotional openness and evolution are nuanced. The mapmaker offers a quietly rich counterpoint. However, their voices, though lyrical, are slightly similar, lacking sharper contrast in persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying within the tight word limit, with a natural beginning, buildup, resolution. Cause-effect is subtle but present; character actions flow logically. A few metaphor-laden transitions verge on hazy, pushing clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The customs office, snowstorm, and sensory-laden relics convey a rich, immersive atmosphere. Every detail enhances mood, tone, and theme, from wintergreen sachets to the symbolic door. A rare instance where setting is central yet non-intrusive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, with potent metaphors and a striking symbolic arc. Literary devices enhance rather than distract. The final image lingers. One or two images verge on overuse but don't mar impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, lyrical phrasing, and a purposeful subversion of genre tropes create a distinctive voice. Occasionally overly ornate, but rarely at the cost of meaning. Emotion is shown through action and dialogue with human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the central theme with creative elegance. The narrative feels self-contained and complete, and each sentence contributes to the tonal and emotional unity. Thoughtful, resonant, and largely publication-ready.</comment>
