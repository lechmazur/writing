<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivo is richly realized through poetic detail, and his motivations—to transcend grief and limitation—are threaded with metaphorical and literal tailoring; his surreal actions align well with his traits, though he remains more archetype than fully human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The recursive plotting across mirrored realities sustains narrative cohesion; despite abstract pacing, the arc from broken code to ascension is emotionally and thematically complete; however, transitions between mirrored timelines verge on elusive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional—evocative, immersive, and texturally rich; setting and tone reinforce theme through steam, brass, and mirrored fog; sensory details finely tuned without sensory overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stunning use of symbolism and metaphor—the mirror, stitches, wind—culminates in a poetic resolution; emotional tone is resonant, though some moments strain under lyrical density over clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original in combining surreal confession, tailored metaphysics, and steampunk ethos; a few phrases echo poetic tropes, but narrative voice and imagery avoid formulaic traps and show individual style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and whole, finishing with a breath of thematic lift; vivid and layered, it lingers in the mind, though its density may slightly obscure for first readers.</comment>
