<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator possesses a distinct, poetic voice and consistent motivations rooted in spiritual exploration and anonymity; their choices and ritualistic behavior reflect deep personal significance, though emotional range could be slightly more dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids conventional structure, emotional and thematic arcs (ritual to revelation) are coherent and purposeful; however, resolution is more lyrical than plot-driven, slightly weakening narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly immersive; sensory details (buzzing fluorescents, broth imagery, whispered ink) and setting are fully integrated into tone and action, yielding a rich, cohesive world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking originality and metaphoric depth avoid clich√©s; language is stylized yet purposeful, though occasionally borders on overwrought; emotional portrayal remains nuanced and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive within its surreal logic, with layered thematic execution and stylistic control; its embrace of ambiguity feels deliberate rather than limited by word count.</comment>
