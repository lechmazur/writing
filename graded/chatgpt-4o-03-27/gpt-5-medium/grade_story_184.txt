<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator has a strong, consistent voice, and their motivation—emerging over time—builds naturally from their personality and environment. However, emotional depth in response to pivotal revelations is muted, and some actions remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Despite the surreal logic, the plot moves with intention and concludes with thematic resonance. Some cause-effect gaps—especially regarding the shells' function—slightly hinder coherence within the compressed arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospherically layered, blending cosmic surrealism with grounded tactile details. Sensory elements are vivid and effectively support mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The poetic prose, inventive metaphors, and thematic layering showcase masterful storytelling. The final image resonates, though emotional stakes could benefit from sharper contrast or clearer tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Remarkably original with few detectable tropes or AI-like patterns. Style is idiosyncratic, with rich, specific imagery and nuanced language that avoids overuse. Some metaphor density risks obfuscating clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion, originality, and thematic reach reflect high craftsmanship. Slight abstraction in plot logic and emotional immediacy keep it short of perfection, but it's near-publishable in elite journals.</comment>
