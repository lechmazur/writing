<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct voice, with a compelling mix of recklessness and emotional depth; motivations are consistently tied to memory, trust, and restoration, though Mara remains more underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story successfully creates a complete arc with symbolic resolution, but some transitions—particularly from past to present—are slightly impressionistic, risking slight disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and mood; "hush of old videotapes," "felted steel," and "tide-humming chassis" create an immersive world tightly aligned with the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative metaphors and symbolism (island memories, shells, blueprint ribs) elevate the craft; emotional resonance is earned, though the ending leans a touch too romanticized for its otherwise restrained tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice and imagery feel distinctive, yet several metaphors verge on over-stylized or border on purple prose; language is mostly purposeful but occasionally ornamental for ornament’s sake.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally impactful; the revisited island and constructed memory-device offer a satisfying metaphorical resolution, though some poetic density softens narrative clarity.</comment>
