<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is strikingly distinct, with motivations and actions consistently shaped by their identity as an "earnestly frivolous" philosopher-king; there's rich introspection and emotional evolution through the betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot elegantly resolves with a return, transformation, and reconciliation; pacing is well-measured, though some transitions (e.g., sudden shift after betrayal) strain clarity under the constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is immersive, symbolic, and poetically rendered; the labyrinth with lanterns enhances the tone and mirrors the character’s inner journey with rich sensory and metaphysical detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally lyrical and layered; metaphors, symbols, and emotional beats cohere into a deeply felt parable on identity and self-discovery, though some conceptual density may challenge accessibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original in metaphors and structure; avoids clichés and shows emotional nuance with surprising turns and fresh syntax; however, one or two figurative choices border on overreach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A daring, poetic piece where all elements serve theme and transformation; concise yet resonant, with a lingering philosophical depth and stylistic confidence rare at this level.</comment>
