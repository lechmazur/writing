<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character’s motivations—rooted in memory, longing, and duty—are clearly and poetically conveyed; though internal, they align with his contemplative actions, and the voice remains distinct throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc within its compressed space, culminating in a symbolic resolution; however, some transitions (e.g., lizard imagery to shrine discovery) feel loosely stitched, lessening narrative tension slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, immersive, and deeply interwoven with tone and character; sensory detail and atmosphere are rich, with metaphorical and literal heat and dryness reinforcing theme and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking symbolism, effective use of motif (flame, memory, map), and lyrical prose elevate the telling; the ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though subtlety borders on opacity in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in voice and concept; metaphors are fresh and often surprising; minor moments of poetic excess slightly weaken clarity, but emotional nuance is handled with precision rare in synthetic prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and emotional resonance; the story’s interplay of fire, memory, and celestial mapping delivers lingering depth despite the brevity of the form.</comment>
