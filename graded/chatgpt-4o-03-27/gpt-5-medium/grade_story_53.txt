<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is distinct and poetic, and their motivation—to protect without harm—is deeply intertwined with their self-conception as a “rash protector”; however, the internal evolution slightly overshadows concrete character action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc is coherent and emotionally fulfilling despite the lyrical tone; however, the middle lacks propulsion, and the “chance encounter” feels more symbolic than plot-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, with wind, salt, iron, and echo used to build a layered sensory world that mirrors internal emotion with atmospheric precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lyrical craft is exceptional, rich in metaphor and subtext, and the central metaphor of protection translating into gentleness is emotionally resonant; still, it verges on overwrought at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and original, largely avoiding cliché or formula, with inventive metaphorical construction; minor moments of abstraction slightly dilute emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A well-integrated, atmospheric piece with poetic depth and thematic unity; feels complete and reflective despite its brevity, though momentum could be slightly stronger.</comment>
