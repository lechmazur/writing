<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mage’s personality is delicately rendered through action and setting, his motivations clear and consistent; Kettle adds contrast and emotional texture, though Commander Rhee’s presence, while evocative, remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc achieves emotional resolution through mood rather than plot; cause-effect logic is subtle but coherent, though the action “clash” is metaphorical, which may lessen structural clarity for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and emotionally resonant; the lunar base and its reclaimed materials are richly imagined, anchoring tone and metaphor through concrete sensory detail and precise setting-world integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gorgeous use of metaphor and theme; "charred serenity" and "echoes" are carried with discipline and strength; lacks only a touch more narrative propulsion to match its emotional and poetic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original concepts and voice; metaphors are fresh and specific; emotional nuance is layered and human, with minimal signs of formulaic or AI-stock phrases—language is stylistically consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, contemplative piece that feels deliberately paced and expertly crafted; shows creative thought in merging emotional healing and sci-fi imagery with resonance beyond its surface plot.</comment>
