<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct voice, emotionally nuanced and consistent with the "unsteady sentinel" role; motivation to reassemble the prophecy is thematically and psychologically aligned, though character development is more atmospheric than dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is poetic but coherent; the arc—reconstruction, choice, confrontation, and reflection—emerges subtly yet effectively, though the progression relies heavily on metaphor at the cost of clarity in action at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is evocative and immersive; the abandoned docking bay, mechanical bird, and sensory-rich descriptions create a unique destabilized mood that perfectly mirrors the protagonist’s internal state and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor, layered subtext, and emotional resonance; the tension between prophecy and agency is deeply felt. Ending is haunting, though the intensity of figurative language occasionally blurs narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is inventive and fresh, largely avoiding cliché; a few moments verge on over-ornate phrasing, but overall the story exhibits originality and a compelling personal style with emotional nuance beyond surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and artfully composed; every element serves the atmosphere and theme. The brevity feels intentional, with restrained yet affecting momentum and a lingering philosophical weight post-reading.</comment>
