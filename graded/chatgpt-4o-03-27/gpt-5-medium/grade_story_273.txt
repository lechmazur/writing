<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator is vivid and distinctive, with a clear motivation rooted in preserving stories and resisting control, rendered in a consistent voice; however, their emotional range and evolution are somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is surreal yet coherent, with a beginning, middle, and resolution that mirror the ritualistic storytelling cycle; momentum lingers near poetic rather than plot-driven, weakening urgency slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exquisite use of setting and sensory detail; the swamp fortress, marsh, chapel of reeds, and bottleborne messages form an immersive world steeped in mood and metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor, subtext, and thematic layering; the language is lyrical and memorable, though occasionally skirts the edge of obscurity in its more abstract turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original and metaphorically dense, with fresh symbolic constructs; only minor moments veer into ornamental language that slightly muddies precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Balances surrealism with cohesion in a remarkably elegant structure; the story closes with emotional resonance and thematic clarity, though not quite transcendent.</comment>
