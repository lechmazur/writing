<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sarah is vividly drawn with a distinct voice and consistent motivation; her cheerful meddling evolves believably into something more obsessive, though her internal logic could be slightly more grounded for full clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution, though the symbolic logic occasionally strains narrative clarity, and the pacing flirts with being too dreamlike to fully anchor cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and haunting, with strong sensory detail and a surreal tone that enhances the story’s themes; the hospital, beach, and tower are all vividly rendered and interconnected.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphor enrich the narrative, and the ending delivers a resonant shift in perspective; however, the emotional stakes remain slightly abstract, limiting deeper reader investment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique narrative voice; avoids clichés and formulaic structure, though a few transitions verge on overly poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and thematically rich; the story lingers in the mind and uses its brevity as a strength, though a touch more emotional grounding would elevate it further.</comment>
