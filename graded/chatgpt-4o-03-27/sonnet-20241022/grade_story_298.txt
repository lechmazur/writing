<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is a compelling, well-developed character whose motivations and internal conflicts are clearly aligned with his method and emotional arc; his transformation into Dr. Lin is both literal and symbolic, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and emotionally resonant, with a satisfying arc and a strong twist; however, the pacing is slightly rushed near the resolution, and the cold-case framework could be more tightly integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and symbolic use of light and decay; the Forbidden City’s futuristic ruin enhances the story’s themes of memory and loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is emotionally impactful and thematically rich, using metaphor and subtext effectively; the final revelation is poignant, though some transitions verge on over-explanation rather than letting imagery carry the weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors and emotional nuance; a few phrases lean toward the ornate, but overall the story avoids formulaic patterns and demonstrates clear authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic unity; the elements serve the narrative rather than feeling imposed, and the story lingers emotionally, though a slightly tighter structure would elevate it further.</comment>
