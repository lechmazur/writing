<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya is vividly rendered with a clear internal conflict—her denial of her heritage and gifts—culminating in a believable transformation; her motivations are consistent and layered, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a strong cause-effect chain from memory to revelation; the pacing is deliberate and effective, though the transition to the final metaphysical moment is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory details (steam, light, water) enhancing the surreal tone; the setting and object are deeply intertwined, though the thought experiment chamber could be more concretely realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically rich, the story uses metaphor and symbolism (dance as language, mirror as multiverse) with sophistication; the ending is both ambiguous and satisfying, prompting reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique fusion of science and art; a few phrases verge on ornate, but overall the prose is purposeful and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative, the story integrates its elements with elegance and leaves a lasting impression; minor clarity issues in the final transformation prevent a perfect score.</comment>
