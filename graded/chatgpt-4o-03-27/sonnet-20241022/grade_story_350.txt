<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus is distinct and his motivations are clear, but his emotional arc lacks depth and complexity; his transformation feels more symbolic than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds well toward a resolution, but the pacing is slightly rushed near the end, and the final revelation feels more mystical than narratively earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly evoked with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the ancient temple and twilight mood enhance the mystery and tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and metaphor, particularly with music and fabric, but the emotional payoff is more intellectual than visceral; lacks a moment of true catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, though some metaphors verge on overwrought; avoids clich√©s and shows stylistic control, but occasionally leans into poetic abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imaginative and cohesive, with a compelling blend of mystery and artistry; the story lingers, though it could benefit from a slightly more grounded emotional core.</comment>
