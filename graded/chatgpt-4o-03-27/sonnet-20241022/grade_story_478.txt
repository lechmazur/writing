<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maera is vividly drawn with a clear internal conflict and layered motivation; her secrecy, guilt, and resolve are consistent and compelling, though her apprentice remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a strong sense of cause and effect; however, the climax feels slightly rushed and the apprentice's betrayal could use more buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and symbolically resonant, with sensory details (herbs, moonlight, orchard) enhancing mood and theme; the maelstrom and orchard are especially evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (burned pages, fruit as knowledge), with emotional resonance and thematic depth; the ending is poetic but could land with more narrative weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in tone and concept, with fresh imagery and a unique voice; avoids clich√©s and formulaic structure, though some phrasing borders on overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally rich, with a strong thematic throughline; minor pacing issues and underexplored secondary character slightly limit its full potential.</comment>
