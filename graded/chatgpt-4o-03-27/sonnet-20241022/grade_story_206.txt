<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn, with his precise artistry and quiet defiance aligning well with his motivations; his transformation from strategist to sugar sculptor is compelling, though his emotional arc could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the sugar sculptures as a method of resistance are both logical and poetic, though the rebellion's logistics are lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (crystallized sugar, morning dew, decaying posters) immersing the reader; the forgotten market and its decay mirror the lost history beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with layered symbolism and a powerful final image; some transitions between discoveries feel slightly compressed due to word constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors and subversive use of sugar as resistance; a few phrases verge on ornate, but overall the voice is distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; the elements serve the story rather than dominate it, and the ending lingers with emotional and thematic weight.</comment>
