<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes (orchard to cafe to orchard) feel abrupt and underdeveloped, slightly weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative use of elements, but lacks the narrative sharpness or emotional depth to reach top-tier literary quality.</comment>
