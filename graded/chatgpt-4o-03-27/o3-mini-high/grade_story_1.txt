<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's phobia and stunt double background are intriguing but underdeveloped; his motivations are poetic yet vague, lacking grounding in concrete emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a symbolic arc but lacks narrative clarity; transitions between scenes (e.g., garage sales to pyramid) feel disjointed and metaphorical rather than logically coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and immersive, with strong sensory detail and mood, though the setting's logic (garage sales vs. pyramid) strains believability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is thematically cohesive and stylistically ambitious, but its abstract execution and inconsistent logic limit its overall effectiveness and emotional resonance.</comment>
