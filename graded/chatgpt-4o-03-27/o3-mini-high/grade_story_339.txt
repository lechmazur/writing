<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and thematic resolution, but the pacing is occasionally bogged down by repetition and abstract phrasing that dilutes narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a clear emotional throughline, but its impact is softened by a lack of narrative tension and overreliance on lyrical abstraction.</comment>
