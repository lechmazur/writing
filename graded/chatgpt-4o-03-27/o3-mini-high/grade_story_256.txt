<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character is evocative and poetic, but his motivations remain abstract and underdeveloped; the "loyally disloyal" trait is intriguing but insufficiently explored through concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story leans heavily on mood and imagery, but lacks a clear arc or progression; the narrative feels more like a lyrical meditation than a structured plot.</comment>
