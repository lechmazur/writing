<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miranda has a strong archetype and consistent motivation, but her emotional depth is more told than shown, and her reactions feel stylized rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a lyrical arc but lacks a clear conflict-resolution structure; the plot progression is more atmospheric than causally driven, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The futuristic setting is richly imagined with strong sensory detail and mood, though some elements (like time travel) are underutilized or vague in their influence on the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is poetic and evocative, but often veers into overwriting; emotional resonance is attempted but diluted by abstraction and lack of concrete stakes or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>While the story aspires to originality, it leans heavily on familiar tropes and ornate language; metaphors are often generic or repetitive, and emotional nuance is surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive in tone and ambition, but its impact is blunted by vague conflict, overwritten prose, and underdeveloped use of key elements; it feels more like a mood piece than a complete narrative.</comment>
