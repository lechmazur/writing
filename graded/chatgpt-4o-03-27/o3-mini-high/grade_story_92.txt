<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlon’s motivations are hinted at but remain abstract; his personality is more implied through tone than shown through concrete action or dialogue, limiting emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story leans heavily on atmosphere over plot; while there’s a thematic arc, the narrative lacks a clear progression or resolution, making it feel more like a mood piece than a complete story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is richly rendered with evocative sensory detail and a consistent tone; the haunted mansion and twilight hour are immersive and support the story’s eerie atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, but the emotional impact is dulled by abstraction and lack of specificity; the story gestures at depth without fully delivering it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and phrasing, but repetition of certain motifs (“carefully careless,” “silent agreements”) feels mechanical; lacks the unpredictability of human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric and thematically ambitious, but the story’s cohesion suffers from vagueness and over-reliance on poetic abstraction rather than narrative clarity.</comment>
