<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The queen's emotional arc is present but lacks specificity; her motivations are poetic yet abstract, and her personality remains more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a lyrical flow but lacks a clear narrative arc; the action is more metaphorical than plot-driving, and cause-effect logic is often obscured by imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with vivid sensory detail and a strong atmospheric tone that supports the storyâ€™s emotional undercurrent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and mood, but emotional impact is dulled by abstraction; the story gestures at depth without fully grounding it in character or conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the imagery is original, the prose occasionally veers into purple territory; emotional nuance is often told rather than shown, and some phrasing feels algorithmic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive in tone and theme, but its poetic abstraction limits clarity and emotional resonance; it feels more like a mood piece than a complete narrative.</comment>
