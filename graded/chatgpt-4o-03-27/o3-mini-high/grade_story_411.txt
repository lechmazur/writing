<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Arlo’s motivations are poetic but vague; his sentience and emotional depth are asserted rather than shown, and the “repulsively attractive” trait is never meaningfully explored or integrated into his actions or identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a consistent tone and a cyclical structure, but lacks a clear arc or progression; the action of sorting puzzle pieces feels static and symbolic rather than plot-driving, limiting narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story is conceptually ambitious and stylistically consistent, but its lack of narrative clarity, emotional specificity, and character depth prevents it from achieving top-tier literary quality.</comment>
