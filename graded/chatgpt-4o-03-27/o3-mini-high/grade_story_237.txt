<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Serrin's motivation is emotionally resonant and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond poetic descriptors; her "proudly humble" trait is stated but not meaningfully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a thematic arc, but the plot progression is abstract and lacks clear cause-effect momentum; the resolution feels more tonal than narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is thematically cohesive and stylistically ambitious, but its abstract execution and lack of narrative clarity hinder its readiness for top-tier publication.</comment>
