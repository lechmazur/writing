<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and tonally consistent, with evocative sensory language that supports the surreal atmosphere and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and lyrical prose, but emotional impact is dulled by repetition and abstraction; lacks a central conflict or narrative tension to anchor the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While stylistically ambitious, the prose often veers into overwrought territory with ornate phrasing and vague abstractions that obscure clarity and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptually rich and stylistically bold, but the story feels more like a poetic meditation than a fully realized narrative; cohesion is present, but momentum and clarity suffer.</comment>
