<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivations are present but often obscured by ornate language; emotional depth is hinted at but not fully realized, and his transformation feels more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a mythic arc but lacks clarity and cohesion; transitions between events are often abrupt or overly abstract, weakening narrative momentum and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail, but some elements (e.g., "insect symphony hall") feel more poetic than grounded, slightly distancing the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and mood, but emotional impact is dulled by overwrought prose and a lack of concrete stakes; the ending gestures at profundity without fully earning it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the story avoids clich√©s and shows some originality, it leans heavily on abstract, repetitive phrasing and lacks the specificity and emotional nuance of truly distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is ambitious and thematically resonant, but its execution is uneven; poetic language sometimes obscures clarity, and the narrative arc feels more symbolic than narratively satisfying.</comment>
