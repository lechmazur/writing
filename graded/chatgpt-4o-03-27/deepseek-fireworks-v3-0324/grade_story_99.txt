<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bookbinder's motivations are intriguing and mostly coherent, but their emotional arc lacks depth and specificity; the "strictly casual" trait is underdeveloped and fades quickly under narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but some transitions—especially between flashbacks and present—are abrupt, slightly disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly rendered with evocative sensory detail; the setting enhances the mood and supports the themes of decay and forgotten knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in tone and concept, but some phrasing feels slightly generic or ornamental; emotional nuance is present but not always fully earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Despite minor flaws, the story is cohesive, thematically rich, and lingers after reading; the brevity feels intentional rather than limiting.</comment>
