<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The guard’s internal conflict and yearning are well-drawn, with his loyally disloyal nature subtly revealed through action and symbolism, though his arc could benefit from more concrete backstory or dialogue to deepen emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the spoon’s fall and the leap are effective turning points, though the pacing slightly lingers in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and immersive, with strong sensory detail and metaphorical resonance; the floating island and mist evoke the theme of transience and longing effectively.</comment>
