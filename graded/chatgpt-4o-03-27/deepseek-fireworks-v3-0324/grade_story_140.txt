<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with a clear arc from repression to acceptance; his grief and guilt are subtly conveyed through his interaction with the doll and setting, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with strong cause-effect logic and a resonant resolution; the pacing is deliberate and effective, though the planetarium element feels slightly under-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with vivid sensory details and a haunting tone that enhances the emotional weight; the setting and timeframe are deeply entwined with the character’s inner journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (the doll, the Fool card), layered emotional subtext, and a poetic style elevate the narrative; the ending is poignant and thematically resonant, though slightly familiar in its redemptive arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and demonstrates emotional nuance, some metaphors verge on the familiar, and the planetarium encounter feels more like a narrative device than an organic moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically confident; it lingers after reading and uses its elements meaningfully, though a few could be more seamlessly integrated.</comment>
