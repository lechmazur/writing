<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seer’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her personality—quietly determined, skeptical yet hopeful—emerges through her actions and internal reflections; however, her "nondescript" nature slightly limits emotional depth and memorability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the method of untangling via scent is surreal but thematically coherent, though it stretches plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite the abstract method and poetic tone, the story feels cohesive and purposeful, with strong thematic unity and emotional resonance.</comment>
