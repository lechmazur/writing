<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The archer’s motivation is clearly rooted in compassion rather than conquest, and her emotional arc is coherent, but her personality lacks deeper nuance or contradiction that would elevate her beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with strong cause-effect logic, but the pacing feels slightly compressed near the climax, and the sigil/map revelation is a bit too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the bioluminescent fungi and decaying amusement park create a haunting, immersive tone that supports the narrative well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (paper airplane, fork, leaves) is layered and effective, and the story evokes reflection, but the emotional impact is slightly muted by a lack of deeper character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on the familiar, and the prose occasionally leans into poetic abstraction over clarity, but the story avoids cliché and shows genuine creative synthesis of elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, with a satisfying arc and imaginative use of elements, though it stops just short of the emotional or philosophical depth expected at the highest tier.</comment>
