<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is distinct, with a clear voice and motivation that evolves naturally; his freelancer identity and emotional arc are well-integrated, though the grandmother’s depth is more functional than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a satisfying arc and resolution; the cryptic note and engine repair create a logical, symbolic throughline, though the climax resolves a bit too neatly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story; a few phrases feel slightly rehearsed or overly polished, but overall it avoids cliché and shows stylistic control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the elements feel organically integrated, and the story lingers with purpose and thematic clarity.</comment>
