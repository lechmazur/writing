<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the transition from dream to action feels slightly abrupt and underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with thoughtful integration of elements, though it leans slightly on familiar fantasy tropes without fully subverting them.</comment>
