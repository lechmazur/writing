<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer’s internal conflict is well-rendered, with his motivations and emotional arc clearly tied to his past and the symbolic locket; his transformation feels earned and human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the climax is more emotional than plot-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (washcloth, locket), emotional resonance, and a satisfying thematic resolution; some lines verge on overwrought, but overall the craft is high.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While some metaphors are familiar, the story avoids clichés and presents a fresh emotional journey; the tone is consistent and the imagery purposeful, though occasionally bordering on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich; all elements serve the narrative, though a few transitions feel slightly too polished or symbolic to be fully organic.</comment>
