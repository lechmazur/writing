<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, but his internal arc is somewhat underdeveloped; we see transformation, but not enough struggle or complexity to make it fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, with strong cause-effect logic; however, the middle section feels slightly rushed, and the transition to the glade encounter is too smooth to feel fully organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with excellent sensory detail and tonal consistency; the forest glade and its surreal qualities are vividly rendered and support the story’s emotional core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly around sound and silence; the ending is emotionally satisfying, though the conflict resolution feels a touch too easy given the buildup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Well-crafted and emotionally resonant, with a cohesive structure and strong thematic unity; minor pacing and depth issues prevent it from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
