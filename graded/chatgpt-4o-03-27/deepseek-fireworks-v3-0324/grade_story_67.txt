<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and layered, with his joviality undercut by existential weariness; however, his motivation to "tame darkness" feels more symbolic than grounded in personal stakes, slightly weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution within the word limit, though the climax (machine explosion) feels slightly rushed and the cause-effect of the shadow-capturing device could be more logically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic is richly atmospheric, with sensory details and symbolic objects (metronome, shadows) enhancing mood and theme; the setting and timeframe are well-integrated and evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (metronome, earring, shadows) creates emotional depth and thematic cohesion; the ending is poignant, though the story leans slightly on abstraction over concrete conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Language is mostly fresh and purposeful, with strong imagery and minimal cliché; a few phrases verge on poetic excess, but overall the voice feels human and intentional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and thematically rich, the story lingers emotionally and intellectually; minor clarity issues in the machine’s function and Elias’s motivation prevent a perfect score.</comment>
