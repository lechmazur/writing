<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story; a few phrases verge on ornate, but overall the language is purposeful and avoids clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite the brevity, the story feels complete and thematically rich, with a satisfying emotional arc and a lingering sense of mystery and transformation.</comment>
