<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character is vividly rendered with a consistent internal logic and emotional arc; his motivations are clear and his actions—reassembling ticket stubs, interacting with the drone—reveal depth and regret. However, his voice, while distinct, could be sharpened further for maximum resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The pacing is deliberate and effective, though the resolution leans more on mood than plot, which may leave some readers wanting a stronger narrative payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and symbolically rich, with strong sensory details (ozone, scorched tables) that reinforce the emotional tone. The lab and drone are tightly integrated into the character’s internal journey, enhancing atmosphere and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, using metaphor and symbolism (the drone, the stubs) to powerful effect. The prose is lyrical without being overwrought, and the ending delivers a quiet but impactful resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates a unique voice and perspective. While a few phrases verge on the poetic-for-poetic’s-sake, the overall style is controlled and purposeful, with fresh metaphors and emotional nuance throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally rich, and stylistically confident. All elements serve the narrative rather than feeling imposed. It leaves a lingering impression, though a slightly more defined external conflict might elevate it further.</comment>
