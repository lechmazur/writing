<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spy’s emotional conflict is well-rendered, with his lovelorn state shaping his actions and internal monologue; his motivation is consistent and nuanced, though the woman’s role could be more developed to deepen his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with the rooftop reunion providing closure; however, the pacing slightly falters in the middle, and the “avalanche” metaphor feels under-integrated structurally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The futuristic slums are vividly evoked with strong sensory detail and atmosphere that supports the character’s emotional state and the story’s tone; the setting enhances the narrative rather than merely decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with effective use of symbolism (label, reflections); the ending is satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overwrought and could be more precise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in its imagery and emotional layering; a few phrases feel slightly too polished or stylized, but overall the voice is distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally impactful, with all elements serving the narrative; it leaves a lingering impression, though a few transitions could be smoother for full polish.</comment>
