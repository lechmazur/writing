<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and layered, with his swindler persona gradually peeled back to reveal vulnerability; Lila is less developed but serves as a strong foil. Motivations are implied more than explicit, but consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution. The pacing is tight and effective, though the climax could be slightly more impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and deeply atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and metaphorical resonance. The orchard-skyscraper fusion is original and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., blank price tag, vines, frozen computer). The ending is emotionally resonant and thematically satisfying, though some dialogue edges toward the expository.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh imagery and a unique setting elevate the story. Some phrases verge on overly poetic, but overall the voice is consistent and avoids clich√©. Emotional nuance is present and effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative. The elements feel integrated rather than forced, and the story lingers with a sense of quiet revelation. A few moments could be sharpened for clarity.</comment>
