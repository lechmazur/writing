<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archer's internal conflict is well-rendered, with his disillusionment and symbolic gestures (e.g., dropping the comb) aligning with his emotional arc; however, his transformation feels slightly abrupt given the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the constraints, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing of the epiphany is a touch rushed, and the bridge metaphor, while strong, borders on overuse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and metaphor are skillfully employed, particularly the comb and waterfall; the emotional shift is effective, though the ending could benefit from more subtlety or ambiguity to deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique setting elevate the piece, though a few phrases verge on poetic excess; overall, the voice feels distinct and human, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic unity; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though a slightly more nuanced resolution would elevate it further.</comment>
