<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair is vividly drawn with a consistent internal logic—his dazed nobility, quiet rebellion, and poetic mission are all well-aligned; however, the scholar’s sudden appearance feels slightly convenient and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the transition to the scholar’s arrival is abrupt and slightly weakens the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory details and symbolic resonance; the sound garden and chalked sidewalks enhance the surreal, lyrical tone and support the theme beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with elegant prose and layered symbolism; the final image is memorable, though the central conflict remains more philosophical than dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in tone and concept, with fresh metaphors and a unique voice; a few phrases verge on the ornate, but overall the language is purposeful and evocative rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally satisfying, with all elements serving a unified vision; minor pacing issues and a slightly underdeveloped secondary character prevent a perfect score.</comment>
