<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a satisfying arc, though some transitions (e.g., from cooking class to grotto) feel abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and metaphor, but a few tropes (e.g., chosen one, magical object) are used without subversion; language occasionally veers toward generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Well-structured and thematically cohesive, with creative use of elements, though not quite at the level of literary distinction expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
