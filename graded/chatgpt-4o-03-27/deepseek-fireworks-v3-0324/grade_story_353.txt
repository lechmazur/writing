<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn with a strong internal conflict and consistent motivation; her "cynically gentle" nature is well-expressed through action and symbolism, though her emotional arc could deepen further with more nuance in the final confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the time travel mechanism is slightly underexplained but functions symbolically and structurally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (rosemary, ozone, shadows) enhancing tone and theme; the mystical setting and timeframe are well-integrated and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (flowers, bread, moon), emotionally resonant ending, and layered themes of memory, resistance, and mercy; slightly more dialogue or internal reflection could elevate emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original imagery and fresh metaphors elevate the prose, though occasional phrasing veers toward ornate; emotional nuance is mostly shown, not told, with only minor lapses into abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative; the elements feel organically woven into the narrative, and the story lingers with thematic resonance and stylistic clarity.</comment>
