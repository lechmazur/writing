<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the premise is original, some metaphors and transitions feel formulaic or overly tidy; the writing avoids clichés but doesn’t fully escape a constructed feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its emotional and stylistic execution doesn’t yet reach the polish or complexity expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
