<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s emotional depth and motivation are clear and consistent, but the girl remains underdeveloped, and Eli’s shift from duty to action feels slightly abrupt given his established role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and the climax lacks tension; the transition from duty to departure feels too easy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on cliché; emotional nuance is present but occasionally overwritten, and the narrative arc is familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive tone, but lacks the surprise or complexity expected at the highest literary level; emotional payoff is solid but not profound.</comment>
