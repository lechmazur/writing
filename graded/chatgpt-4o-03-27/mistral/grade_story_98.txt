<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eldridge’s transformation is clear, but his faintheartedness is mostly told, not shown; his motivations are consistent but lack emotional depth or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition into the initiation chamber feels abrupt and underdeveloped; pacing is mostly effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative in places, especially the chamber and twilight setting, but sensory detail is inconsistent and the setting feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>There’s thematic ambition and some poetic phrasing, but the emotional impact is muted and the symbolism lacks subtlety; conflict is internal but underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but the writing occasionally leans on vague abstractions and familiar tropes; lacks a distinctive voice or surprising insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competent and cohesive, but not yet compelling or memorable enough for top-tier publication; shows promise but needs refinement in depth and execution.</comment>
