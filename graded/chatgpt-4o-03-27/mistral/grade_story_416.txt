<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sir Eldred’s straight-laced nature and Lyra’s academic rebellion are clearly stated, but their personalities are more told than shown; motivations are consistent but lack depth or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the inciting incident (bumping into each other) feels contrived and underdeveloped; pacing is solid, though the climax is too convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and pleasant, with a satisfying arc, but doesn’t push boundaries or leave a lasting impression; competent but not exceptional.</comment>
