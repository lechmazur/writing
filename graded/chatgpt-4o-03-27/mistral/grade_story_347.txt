<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eamon’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond his role; the “singularly multiple” trait is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the climax feels slightly rushed and the cause-effect chain around the string-breaking is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The perpetual motion workshop is vividly rendered with strong sensory cues; the atmosphere supports the tone and concept effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on generic; the prose occasionally slips into formulaic phrasing and lacks a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but not quite at the level of literary excellence; it feels crafted around prompts rather than organically inspired.</comment>
