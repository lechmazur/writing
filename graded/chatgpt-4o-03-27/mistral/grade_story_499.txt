<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s motivations are clearly rooted in personal loss and legacy, and his rational-poetic duality is consistently reflected in his actions and internal conflict; however, his emotional arc could be deepened with more nuanced internal struggle or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with strong cause-effect logic; however, the transition from ghostwriter to whistleblower feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more tension or complication.</comment>
