<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eldridge’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his transformation is believable, but his personality lacks depth beyond the “lovably grumpy” trope, and his voice is not particularly distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, and the metamorphosis is well-integrated, but the pacing feels slightly rushed, and the transition from skepticism to fulfillment of prophecy is too abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the setting and object, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes (reluctant hero, prophecy) without subversion; language is occasionally generic and overly tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, with a satisfying arc, but lacks the depth, nuance, and stylistic distinction required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
