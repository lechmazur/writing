<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias has a clear arc from confusion to resolve, but his internal transformation feels slightly rushed and underexplored given the emotional weight of his past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc and resolution, but the transition from jogging to climbing a magical stalk to entering a portal feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Well-crafted and cohesive, with a clear theme and emotional resolution, though not quite transcendent or surprising enough for top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
