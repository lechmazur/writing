<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Silasâ€™s arc from cowardice to courage is clear but overly convenient; his transformation lacks sufficient internal conflict or complexity to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is rushed and the prophecy element feels underdeveloped, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is gently evocative, but the setting details are sparse and underutilized; the map projection room and hush timeframe are barely integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in premise, but the prose leans generic and the metaphors are vague; lacks the stylistic distinctiveness of top-tier fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent and complete, but not exceptional; the story feels constructed around prompts rather than organically inspired.</comment>
