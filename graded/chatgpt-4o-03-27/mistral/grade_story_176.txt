<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Puck’s emotional arc is clear and well-motivated, with his apathy gradually giving way to engagement through Lily’s empathy; however, his academically playful nature is underutilized and could be more distinctly expressed in his dialogue or internal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the transformation is believable and well-paced, though the transition from apathy to joy could benefit from one more beat of internal conflict to deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mushroom garden is vividly rendered and supports the story’s whimsical yet melancholic tone; sensory details are strong and the setting enhances the emotional atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes genuine emotion and uses metaphor and subtext well, particularly in the “barbed wire arms” line; however, some moments lean toward telling rather than showing, slightly reducing the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows emotional nuance, some phrasing (e.g., “the hum of insight”) feels abstract and underdeveloped, and the tone occasionally veers into overly poetic territory without grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a strong thematic throughline; while not groundbreaking, it’s a well-crafted piece that lingers after reading.</comment>
