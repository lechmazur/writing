<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Edgar is distinct and his transformation is clear, but his internal motivations shift too quickly from morbid detachment to compassionate defiance without enough psychological depth or resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from solitary performer to public figure feels slightly rushed and underdeveloped given the complexity of the shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The decaying lab and sensory detail of the spices create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the surreal tone and Edgar’s transformation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and theme, particularly the bent ruler and spices, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of tension or stakes; the conflict is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors and a unique tone; avoids clichés and formulaic structure, though some transitions feel slightly mechanical or overly tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Inventive and cohesive with a lingering thematic resonance, though the emotional arc could be deepened for greater impact; the story feels complete but not transcendent.</comment>
