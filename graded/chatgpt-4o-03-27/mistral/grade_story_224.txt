<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from discovery to magical transformation is abrupt and underdeveloped, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Creative and cohesive, with a satisfying arc, but the story doesn’t fully transcend its premise or leave a lasting impression beyond its surface charm.</comment>
