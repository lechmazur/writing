<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Edgar is distinct and his motivations are clear, but his emotional arc feels slightly underdeveloped; his transition to embracing his powers is too smooth to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is slightly compressed; the climax lacks tension due to the predictability of Edgar’s decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some elements feel familiar or lightly handled (e.g., cosmic powers, family legacy), but the integration is thoughtful and avoids overt cliché; language is mostly purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, with a satisfying resolution; while not groundbreaking, it demonstrates strong craft and emotional clarity.</comment>
