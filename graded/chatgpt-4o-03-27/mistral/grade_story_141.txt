<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and his superstition is well-integrated, but his emotional arc feels rushed and his transformation lacks sufficient internal conflict or development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the scavenger hunt setup is underdeveloped and the transition to the underwater journey feels abrupt and overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater cave and bioluminescent imagery are evocative and immersive, though the city setting and storm motif could be more fully realized to enhance atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and metaphors, but the narrative leans on familiar mystical tropes and lacks the unpredictability or nuance of truly original fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic ambition, but the story feels slightly schematic, with some elements (like the scavenger hunt) feeling more like scaffolding than organic parts of the narrative.</comment>
