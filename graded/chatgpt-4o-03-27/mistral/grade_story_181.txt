<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eli’s motivations are clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond archetypal traits; his “blatantly secretive” nature is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from spice shop to sanctuary to glowing flower feels rushed and overly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competent and cohesive, but lacks the polish, emotional resonance, and stylistic distinctiveness required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
