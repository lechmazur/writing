<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ã‰louan is distinct and compelling, with motivations rooted in loss, introspection, and philosophical inquiry; the visitor's coded desperation adds contrast, though her development is thinner.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and complete within the word limit, but the visitor's quest feels slightly underdeveloped, and the sock metaphor, while clever, risks feeling overly symbolic without deeper grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive tone; the story lingers in the mind, though a slightly deeper emotional payoff would elevate it further.</comment>
