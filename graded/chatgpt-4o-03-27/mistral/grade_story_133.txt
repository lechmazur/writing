<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias has a clear motivation and some emotional depth, but his transformation feels too convenient and lacks internal conflict or complexity; Isolde is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and a satisfying resolution, but the transition from painting to prophecy to quest feels rushed and underexplored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth orchard and colonial town are evocative and atmospheric, but sensory detail is uneven and the setting sometimes feels more decorative than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story hints at deeper themes and uses some effective imagery, but lacks emotional resonance and subtext; the prose leans toward telling over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and tone, but the narrative relies on familiar tropes (prophecy, chosen one) without significant subversion or surprise; language occasionally veers into generic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but its emotional and thematic impact is muted by underdeveloped characters and a reliance on exposition over dramatization.</comment>
