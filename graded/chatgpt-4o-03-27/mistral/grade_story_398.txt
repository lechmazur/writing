<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Edmund and Lyra are sketched with warmth and purpose, but their motivations and emotional arcs remain surface-level; their connection lacks depth beyond narrative function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical progression, but the climax and resolution feel rushed and overly convenient, with minimal tension or complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative in parts, especially the mill and the shop, but sensory detail is sparse and the atmosphere could be more immersive and textured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story has a gentle charm and a hopeful theme, but lacks emotional complexity, subtext, or striking literary craft; it tells more than it shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but the execution leans on familiar tropes and predictable structure; metaphors and phrasing are serviceable but not fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and pleasant, but not particularly memorable or profound; it feels like a well-constructed draft rather than a polished literary piece.</comment>
