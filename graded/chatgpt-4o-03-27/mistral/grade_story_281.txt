<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Thaddeus has a clear arc from survivalist to self-reflective, but his transformation feels abrupt and underdeveloped given the brevity; his voice is distinct but not deeply nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a logical if slightly rushed arc; the dummy encounter drives the plot, but the resolution feels too tidy for the eerie setup.</comment>
