<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the connection between the cellphone and the artifact feels tenuous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Well-structured and imaginative, but not yet at the level of literary distinction—needs more nuance in character and thematic layering.</comment>
