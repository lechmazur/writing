<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Edgar’s motivations are clear and emotionally resonant, but his transformation feels slightly too convenient and underexplored for full depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc and logical progression, though the discovery of the map in a fingerprint strains plausibility and weakens coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The beehive setting is richly imagined with strong sensory detail that enhances mood and supports the character’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly the ruler and fingerprint, though the emotional payoff could be more layered and less overt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Well-crafted and emotionally satisfying, with creative integration of elements, though not quite at the level of literary distinction expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
