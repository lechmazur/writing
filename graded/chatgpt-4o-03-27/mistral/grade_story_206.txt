<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelie’s motivations are clearly rooted in personal loss and rebellion, and her actions—crafting symbolic candies and leading a subtle resistance—align well with her vendetta and precise creativity; however, her emotional arc could be deepened with more internal conflict or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc from personal grief to communal uprising; the sugar map climax is effective, though the transition from locket to rebellion feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The forgotten market is vividly rendered with strong sensory and symbolic detail; the atmosphere of quiet resistance and decay supports the tone and character motivation exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with strong symbolism (sugar map, locket), though some metaphors verge on the familiar and the ending, while satisfying, could benefit from more ambiguity or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids most clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrasing leans toward the generic or overly poetic, and the emotional beats, though effective, occasionally feel too neatly resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and impactful, with a strong central metaphor and emotional throughline; it balances theme and narrative well, though a few transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>
