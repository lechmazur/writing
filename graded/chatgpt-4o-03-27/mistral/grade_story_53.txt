<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is given a defining trait—rash protector—but this is only lightly touched and not deeply explored; his transformation feels too convenient and lacks emotional complexity or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from moving day to cosmic destiny feels abrupt and underdeveloped; the pacing is smooth but the plot leans on coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory details and a consistent mystical tone that enhances the narrative’s mood and supports the character’s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>There’s emotional resonance and some symbolic layering, but the story leans on familiar tropes and lacks a truly fresh or surprising insight; the ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the prose avoids overt clichés, the narrative structure and metaphors feel familiar; the story lacks a distinctive voice or stylistic risk that would elevate it beyond competent execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but it doesn’t fully transcend its premise; it’s competent and atmospheric, but not yet exceptional or unforgettable.</comment>
