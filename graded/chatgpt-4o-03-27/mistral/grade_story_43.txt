<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eli’s personality is sketched with poetic flair, but his motivations and emotional arc feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded; “loudly introverted” is evocative but underexplored in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the plot leans heavily on metaphor and atmosphere, occasionally sacrificing narrative clarity and tension for mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the prose is lyrical and avoids overt cliché, some metaphors feel slightly generic or ornamental; the emotional beats are more told than shown in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a strong mood and concept, but lacks the narrative risk or stylistic distinctiveness to reach elite literary status.</comment>
