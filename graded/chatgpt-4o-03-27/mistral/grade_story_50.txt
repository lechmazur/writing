<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eldridge's internal conflict is well-drawn, with his wavering faith and desire for understanding driving his actions; however, his emotional arc could benefit from more nuanced shifts rather than a sudden resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the pacing is strong, though the climax feels slightly rushed in its resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass desert and chapel are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, and the atmosphere powerfully supports the themes of isolation, faith, and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolism is rich (e.g., fork, butterfly, echoes), and the story evokes reflection on faith and purpose; the prose is lyrical without excess, though the emotional payoff could be more layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clich√©s and shows stylistic control, some metaphors (e.g., "capriciously consistent sun") verge on overwrought, and the piano decoding feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic unity elevate the piece; the elements feel mostly integrated, though one or two (e.g., piano echoes) could be more organically embedded.</comment>
