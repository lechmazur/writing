<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Beatrice’s arc from resentment to reluctant acceptance is well-executed and emotionally plausible, with voice and tone consistent; her grumpiness feels organic rather than cartoonish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and satisfying for the word count, with clear cause-effect logic; the plot’s key moment (the beetle purifying water) is well-seeded but slightly convenient.</comment>
