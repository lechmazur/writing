<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya is compellingly drawn with a clear arc from lost girl to awakening heir; motivations align well with her history, though her emotional transformation happens a bit too fast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story flows smoothly with a complete arc and effective pacing; the spoon, murals, and revelation drive the plot logically and emotionally, though the final leap toward destiny feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive and symbolically resonant; sensory and atmospheric details powerfully convey mood and theme, enhancing the mural-as-memory conceit and the projector's flickering temporality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and layered, with strong metaphorical resonance and emotional subtext; the ending offers satisfying ambiguity, though some symbolism (e.g., “co-author a future with chaos”) verges on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story feels highly original, using familiar tropes inventively and with emotional texture; metaphors are mostly fresh, and tone/style remain consistent, though a few phrases flirt with purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story integrates all elements with unusual cohesion and imagination, delivering emotional resonance and stylistic distinctiveness that lingers; a few transitions could be smoother for peak clarity.</comment>
