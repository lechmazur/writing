<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vera’s emotional arc is subtle yet powerful, and her apathy is convincingly portrayed through small, consistent gestures; Darwin’s consciousness is original and adds psychological depth, though some might find it slightly underdeveloped as a character in its own right.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a delicate balance of internal and external motion—Vera’s spontaneous journey leading to a discovery that reinforces the theme; resolution is quiet but earned, with minimal narrative drag and elegant coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in is rendered with poetic specificity and decay-laced imagery that mirrors the protagonist’s emotional state; sensory details are evocative without excess, and the atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotion emerges organically from subtext and setting rather than exposition; symbolic elements (bookmark, plant, drive-in) enrich the story’s meditation on loss and renewal—literary craft is precise and layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and an unusually poignant use of a sentient plant avoid cliché; style is confident and restrained, though Darwin's inner voice borders on underutilized in some places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Affecting, cohesive, and unusually elegant in execution; each element deepens the narrative without feeling shoehorned, and the emotional resonance lingers meaningfully.</comment>
