<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn: a gentle giant whose whispering to carnivorous plants and broken language ground his motivations convincingly in trauma, tenderness, and guilt; his evolution from caretaker to conductor of horrors is unsettlingly believable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and satisfying within the word limit, with strong cause-effect logic leading from discovery to irony-laced climax; the pacing is tight, though a few transitions could be smoothed for even better coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory detail—fogged glass, hunger-songs, root-songs—builds an oppressive, immersive atmosphere; the greenhouse is a living character, enhancing mood, danger, and setting beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is emotionally rich and thematically resonant, with visceral metaphor and chilling irony; the twist redefines the protagonist’s mission and lingers disturbingly, though a touch more subtlety might elevate the ending further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution: fresh metaphors, a unique protagonist, and a haunting subversion of the resurrection trope; some lines border on florid but largely avoid cliché or mechanical phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and stylistically confident; assigned elements serve the story without feeling forced, and its mythic tone and tragic irony deliver lasting impact beyond the read.</comment>
