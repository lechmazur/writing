<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus is a well-developed and internally consistent character; his fixation on the mirror and the bead effectively reveals his trauma-driven motivation. His ‘voice’ is subdued but distinct, emotionally rich without overt exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with a strong, emotional arc contained within the word limit—beginning, middle, and resolution are clear, and cause-effect logic is tight. The ending circles back with resonance, though the vigilante angle lacks full momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The abandoned airport, funhouse mirror, and virtual call setting are vividly realized and synergize with the mood. Sensory and symbolic atmospherics are deftly handled, enhancing emotional tension and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, layered metaphor, and restrained prose create a powerful emotional resonance. The story explores trauma subtly while avoiding melodrama, and the final image leaves a lasting impression. Slight lack of tension arc diminishes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés, offering symbolic nuance and fresh perspective. Some similes lean into the familiar, and a few moments risk abstraction, but overall it maintains a unique emotional tone and specificity of detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant structure with thematic cohesion; every element serves the narrative, though not all are equally vital. The story feels complete, introspective, and haunting—lingering in thought beyond its short form.</comment>
