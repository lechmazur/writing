<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus is distinctly characterized through subtle choices—his attire, inherited duty, and calm command in crisis—but some emotional depth and internal conflict are glossed over in favor of plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is well-structured, with a clear arc and resolution under tight constraints; however, the climax is slightly rushed and overly convenient in its resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite its brevity, the story leaves a strong impression, artfully combining tone, theme, and character arc; a few elements feel shoehorned, but cohesion remains high.</comment>
