<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Both Eleanor and Marcus are sharply rendered; Eleanor’s curse consistently drives her dialogue and emotional restraint, while Marcus’s arc from observer to awakened participant is believable and well-motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot has clear structure and payoff—Marcus’s journey is developed and resolved elegantly within the word count, though the climax leans slightly on exposition rather than action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is evocative without dominating; details like rusted rides and dusty prizes enhance the mood, though the “haunted” aspect is mildly underused in favor of wistful tone over eerie atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Layered imagery (moonlight, birds, webs of fate) deepens theme of transformation; restrained pathos and poetic phrasing elevate emotional stakes and thematic resonance without overwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, nuanced emotion, and subtle yet specific characterization make this feel wholly authored—not algorithmic; any echoes of familiar tropes are reinvented with style and restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Achieves elegant cohesiveness and emotional depth; the elements are interwoven with care and enrich rather than distract—strong literary merit within compact form.</comment>
