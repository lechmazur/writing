<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra is a distinct, well-voiced character with layered motivation tied to both heritage and existential curiosity; Evangeline complements him with a believable arc, though her depth is more implied than rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc, smooth pacing, and satisfying resolution within the word limit; cause and effect are coherent, though some transitions (e.g., Evangeline's sudden journal reveal) feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory is vividly drawn, atmospheric, and integral to both plot and theme—the setting hums with mechanical life and metaphor, supporting character and tone seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (bones/stars/destiny), intriguing dialogue, and subtextual resonance around fate and knowledge, though emotional stakes could be more viscerally felt to elevate impact further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh take on genre tropes with poetic flourishes and specific, evocative imagery; avoids cliché and demonstrates stylistic control, though moments hint at overly elegant exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive, imaginative, and thematically unified—feels like a complete story rather than a stitched-together prompt exercise; leaves reader with wonder and curiosity.</comment>
