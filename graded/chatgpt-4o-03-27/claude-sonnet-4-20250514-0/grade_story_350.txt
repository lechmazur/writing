<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thalia’s internal transformation is emotionally resonant and rooted in personal history, but her motivations shift rapidly—from perfectionist puppeteer to truth-seeker—without enough prior psychological layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong arc with clear beginning, middle, and end; however, some narrative leaps (e.g., discovering a gown that reveals letters) rely too heavily on symbolic logic rather than organic plot progression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A compelling and cohesive narrative with strong imagery and thematic clarity; slightly marred by a few overly symbolic transitions that lessen narrative plausibility.</comment>
