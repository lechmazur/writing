<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus is clearly motivated by both personal loss and ethical rebellion; his character arc is consistent, emotionally grounded, and deeply tied to the setting and methodâ€”but could benefit from more internal complexity or flawed nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story unfolds coherently and efficiently, with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the echo test and rosebud naturally drive the plot, though a slightly more dynamic middle could heighten tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and elegant use of metaphor enrich the narrative; subtext regarding exploitation and sanctuary adds depth, though the prose at times leans toward overstatement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While grounded in familiar tropes, the story injects originality through the echo test and science-magic duality; occasional phrasing feels overly formal or abstract, slightly dulling its emotional edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, conceptually rich, and evocative; it balances introspection with momentum, leaving a strong emotional and thematic aftertaste that lingers without requiring exposition.</comment>
