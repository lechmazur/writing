<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly characterized with consistent motivations—his dual obsessions (justice and traditional games) are woven well, and his lazily ambitious nature is reflected in both method and outcome; however, his transformation lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story manages a full and satisfying arc within the word limit, transitioning coherently from vigilante disillusionment to a more personal revelation, though the pivot from crime-fighting to game-collecting feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, reflective, and emotionally satisfying story that unites all elements with nuance, though the central conflict remains more philosophical than dramatic.</comment>
