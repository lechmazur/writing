<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dr. Synthesis is a strong, distinct presence, and the emotional moments with cadets hint at deep character motivations—but secondary characters could use more individualization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arc is well-contained and coherent within the word limit, with a satisfying transformation from emotional burden to readiness—though the pacing skims over some cadets’ stories.</comment>
