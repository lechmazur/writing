<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus and Elena both exhibit layered motivations and distinct emotional arcs; Marcus’s spiritual fatigue and Elena’s graceful assertiveness are nuanced and consistent, though Elena’s evolution could use slightly more buildup within the limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc is clear and complete, with cause-effect logic well-managed; the encounter and emotional parting feel earned, though the hiking trail-to-dimensional chamber transition is abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The disguise room and shattered barbells create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that reinforces the theme of fractured identity and fading strength; strong sensory detail and tone cohesion enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with strong metaphoric layering (e.g., broken barbells, masks); dialogue is concise and effective, and the closing image is subtle yet powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a distinctive, reflective tone avoid clichés; a few phrases flirt with abstraction, but overall the writing shows strong authorial control and originality in concept and execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegant cohesion across all elements, with a satisfying emotional resolution; complexity is well-balanced within the word limit, though the premise strains logic slightly in the opening leap to a fantastical setting.</comment>
