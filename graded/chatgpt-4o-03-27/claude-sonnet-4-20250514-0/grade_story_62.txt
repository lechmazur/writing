<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn, with consistent motivations driven by heartbreak and intellectual delusion; his actions—storytelling as self-deception—align powerfully with his traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and satisfying within the word limit; cause-effect structure holds well, though the final transition back to the tunnel is slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory detail (rain, muck, rust, wind) crafts a haunting atmosphere that mirrors Marcus's internal decay; the storm drain and orchard are symbolically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deeply layered themes of delusion, meaning-making, and existential avoidance are subtly embedded; storytelling voice is compelling and emotionally textured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original reimagining of setting and object; metaphor of debugging the universe via a coffee cup is inventive, though borderline overextended near the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, affecting, and lingers after reading; occasional minor overreach in abstract metaphor use slightly tempers its polish.</comment>
