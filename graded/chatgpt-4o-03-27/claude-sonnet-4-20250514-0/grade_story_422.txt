<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya is a compelling protagonist whose selective mutism and use of Oscar as a voice reveal both her trauma and resilience; her motivations are clear, though secondary characters lack development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story follows a satisfying emotional arc with a clear resolution, though the dimensional rules and some transitions (like the overheard call) feel mildly contrived under scrutiny.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh imagery and a unique narrative voice elevate this above clich√©, but occasional phrases ("euphoric agitation") feel slightly overwrought or artificial upon repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite a complex mix of elements, the story is emotionally resonant, stylistically cohesive, and thought-provoking; it feels intentional rather than schematic.</comment>
