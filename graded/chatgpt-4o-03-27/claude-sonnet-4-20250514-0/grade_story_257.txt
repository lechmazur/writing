<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s intellectual disillusionment and longing for cultural relevance are convincingly rendered, with her evolution from academic exile to folkloric reanimator feeling emotionally grounded and true to her characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arc from disillusioned exile to creative renewal is well-paced and resolved within the tight constraint; the fireflies and chalkboard metaphorically tie the beginning and end, though the midpoint relies heavily on poetic suggestion over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tavern setting is evocative and textured, and the fireflies and autumnal leaf details create a rich, layered atmosphere that supports the story’s tone and thematic resonance effectively.</comment>
