<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is layered and believable; his transformation feels earned and his motivations align with his actions, though Elena’s reaction is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong arc with a well-paced revelation and emotionally satisfying resolution; the story achieves completeness despite brevity, though staging the museum meetings is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is richly atmospheric and symbolically charged, reinforcing the story’s themes and enhancing mood with vivid sensory cues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective subversion of redemption tropes, fresh metaphor use, and human nuance; slightly formal diction at moments edges toward overwritten but generally avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant with strong control of language and structure; elevates assigned elements without feeling bound to them.</comment>
