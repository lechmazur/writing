<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira is well-realized with a consistent empathic trait informing her purpose and solitude; her motivation to preserve traditions is clear and nuanced. However, some emotional beats remain a little abstracted, slightly muting deeper connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc, with strong cause-effect links and effective pacing. The transformation at the climax ties back to initial elements. One minor structural leap (the figures syncing) could have been foreshadowed more concretely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric, with rich, sensory detail enhancing tone and emotional resonance. The haunted dollhouse museum post-humanity is both original and beautifully rendered, amplifying the central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism, evocative prose, and a clear thematic throughline—memory and tradition as living energy—provide emotional heft. Subtle repetitions and mirrored imagery elevate the story’s literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and assured—avoids cliché by weaving speculative and emotional layers seamlessly. Occasional phrasing leans poetic without excess. A few metaphors verge on familiar, but overall tone is fresh and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally affecting. All elements are in service to an elegant narrative idea. The brevity feels intentional, not limiting. The story leaves a lingering impression of beauty and loss.</comment>
