<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira is compelling and subtly developed; her motivations are consistent and enriched by the object and her methods. Her emotional tenor is well-expressed through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot maintains internal logic and a strong emotional arc, though the resolution is slightly abstract. The encounter with the other runner provides just enough closure, but the pacing edges toward dense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly rendered and deeply atmospheric, supporting tone and theme; sensory details are precise and immersive. The ghost train and fog-laced park are hauntingly effective.</comment>
