<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s motivations are well-established and drive his actions with consistency; his stoicism is convincingly tempered by compassion, and the witch’s emotional shift is earned, though her backstory and personal stakes feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arc is tight and coherent with a clear beginning, tension-building midsection, and satisfying resolution; cause-and-effect are logical, though the climax’s emotional impact could have had more buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly evoked through sensory detail and atmospheric cues—the shadow-familiars, the erasing chalk—but some elements (e.g., timeframe urgency) are implied rather than fully leveraged for tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional undertones, elegant use of metaphor ("smoke," "necessary lies"), and a clear theme of preservation amid decay; dialogue is largely purposeful, though the ending could linger more hauntingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subverts tropes gently and shows nuanced emotion, with crisp, specific language; a few lines border on familiar fantasy phrasing, but human insight outweighs any mechanical lapses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and evocative for its length—feels intentional, not constrained; all elements serve the story, though some could be more deeply woven for maximum resonance.</comment>
