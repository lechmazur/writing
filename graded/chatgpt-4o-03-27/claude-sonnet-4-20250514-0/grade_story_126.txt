<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’ motivations are well-aligned with his journey from disillusioned trader to quiet revolutionary, and his emotional progression is nuanced, though his voice could be more distinctively defined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and well-paced for the word limit, with strong cause-effect structure, though the action of "ascend" feels more metaphorical than literal, slightly weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly rendered with evocative details—dead oceans, peeling posters, and the ghost station reinforce tone and setting expertly; excellent integration with mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The use of metaphor and symbolism (butter churn, flaking propaganda) is skillful and evocative, though at times bordering on overly explicit; emotional impact is strong, but subtlety could be refined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and formula; metaphors are original, but a few lines risk overreach (“alchemy of hope and fury”); slightly too self-aware in places, with language bordering on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and thoughtful with strong thematic resonance; although a few metaphorical choices obscure rather than enhance clarity, the story remains memorable and conceptually potent.</comment>
