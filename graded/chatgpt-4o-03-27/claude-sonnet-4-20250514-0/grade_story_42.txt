<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's evolution from forger to redeemer is compelling and believable; guilt drives his transformation, and his "loyally unique" handwriting becomes emblematic of his redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story maintains coherence and a complete arc within the word limit, though the final military intrusion slightly rushes resolution; the action is thematically and logically integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of ancient temple and wind turbines creates a vivid, symbolic atmosphere; the sensory details and sacred-mechanical contrast elevate the tone effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of elements; the pen’s symbolic arc and the forger’s subversive use of marginalia are inventive and emotionally textured without cliché dependence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant synthesis of theme, setting, and character; while complex, the layered metaphors and arc feel deliberate and artfully contained within constraints.</comment>
