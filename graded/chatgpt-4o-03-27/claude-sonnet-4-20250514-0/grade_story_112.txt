<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s motivations are clearly rooted in her heritage and grief, and they remain consistent throughout. Her transformation from wanderer to preservationist is believable and emotionally resonant, though more internal nuance could elevate her arc further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story flows logically from mystery to discovery to purpose. The hopscotch board's revelation provides a satisfying pivot, though the resolution feels slightly rushed given the emotional weight of the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are deeply immersive—dust, light, and silence evoke the gravity of cultural loss. The writing system archive heightens thematic tension, and sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece effectively blends metaphor, emotion, and theme. The hopscotch board as a metaphor for encoded tradition is fresh. Some phrases verge on sentimentality, slightly weakening the raw emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong originality in using a child’s game as a code for ancestral recipes. A few lines lean toward overwrought prose, and Maya risks becoming an archetype without further texture, but it avoids cliché overall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegant and cohesive integration of elements. The story evokes reflection and lingers emotionally, though the ending could slow slightly for more impact. Nearly ready for publication with light refinement.</comment>
