<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s motivations are clear and compelling, driven by cosmic revenge and grief; her transformation from saboteur to conduit of celestial power is emotionally resonant and internally consistent, though slightly lacking in dialogue or direct emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying within the word limit, and the connection between the beginning and end is well-structured, though some transitions (e.g., her learning mannequin language rapidly) feel compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, surreal, and enhances the story’s tone and themes; the suspended tower city and flickering flashlight create a rich, immersive atmosphere supporting the metaphysical conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance with literary devices like metaphor and imagery used effectively; the story explores powerful themes of grief, revenge, and imperfection, though some emotional beats are more told than shown.</comment>
