<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is clearly and consistently developed as an isolated creative whose actions, inner conflict, and growth align with his motivation; his evolution is authentic, though his voice lacks some distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>While a few moments veer into familiar emotional territory, the fusion of board game metaphor and metaphysical space brings originality; language is mostly fresh and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; all elements serve a deeper theme. The story lingers in memory and succeeds in elevating genre into literary territory.</comment>
