<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kaspar’s backstory and obsession are intriguing, and his motivations are mostly clear, but the xenophobia is underexplored and feels more like a narrative device than a deeply examined trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is surprisingly coherent for the word count, with a strong setup and payoff, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the facility's reveal strains believability without a firmer foundation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and vividly rendered through multisensory detail; the hydroponic farm is both atmospheric and symbolically rich, enhancing mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative prose, strong symbolic layering (puzzle piece, chess, hunger), and an impactful pivot in Kaspar’s worldview elevate the story's resonance despite some overwrought lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imaginative and distinctive concept with a fresh twist on dystopian mechanisms, though a few descriptors (e.g., “agonizing bliss”) verge on melodrama and feel AI-sourced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion and leaves a lasting impression, but tighter editing and deeper psychological nuance would elevate this to a top-tier submission.</comment>
