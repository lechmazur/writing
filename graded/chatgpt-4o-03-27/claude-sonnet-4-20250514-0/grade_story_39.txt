<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Matthias is vividly portrayed, with his motivations and internal contradictions (restless, deceptive, hopeful) emerging naturally through action and atmosphere, though Dr. Chen remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story presents a tight, coherent arc with strong cause and effect; the revolution-through-tailoring premise unfolds plausibly and resolves with tension and purpose under the word limit.</comment>
