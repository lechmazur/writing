<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivations are clear, rooted in her years of invisibility and frustration; her arc from passive observer to avenging successor is compelling and earned, although more emotional texture or inner conflict might have deepened impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot has a complete arc with a strong twist and satisfying resolution; transitions between exposition, discovery, and climax are handled efficiently, though some logical leaps (e.g., leap from glove to magical possession) could use more grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opera house is vividly rendered with rich sensory imagery and a strong, haunting mood; atmosphere aligns perfectly with the story’s gothic tone and deepens its themes of forgotten beauty and hidden sacrifice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and an elegant rhythm elevate the prose; themes of power, invisibility, and artistic cost are developed with nuance, though some lines veer into melodrama which slightly undercuts emotional restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels stylistically distinct, avoiding obvious tropes and clichés; the twist is familiar yet subverted through unexpected means, though hints of literary overreach (slightly florid language) reduce its sharpness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Well-structured, atmospherically rich, and thematically clear; the story lingers emotionally and shows deliberate craftsmanship, though a few transitions feel lightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>
