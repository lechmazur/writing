<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is convincingly portrayed as a weary but principled man; his motivations and quiet resistance feel emotionally grounded, though his voice lacks a truly distinctive personal cadence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc with clear cause and effect; however, the climax and resolution feel slightly rushed, and the "crossroads" metaphor could be more structurally embedded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery and themes are mostly fresh and thoughtful, though a few phrases verge on clichéd dystopian tropes and some transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story effectively combines concept, setting, and character in a compact yet evocative narrative, though it doesn’t quite reach the level of irrefutable mastery required for top-tier publication.</comment>
