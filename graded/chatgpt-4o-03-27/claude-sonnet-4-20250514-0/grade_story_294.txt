<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bard’s emotional arc is clearly defined, with her dry voice and “gorgeously awkward” nature deeply informing her internal struggle; her motivation and transformation are powerfully conveyed through her interaction with the prism and voicemails.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive and elegantly structured within the tight word count; the arc from self-doubt to self-expression lands with clarity and resonance, though a slightly more dynamic turning point could elevate the tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly imagined—bioluminescent fungal walls, a singing hall that remembers—creating a vivid, immersive world perfectly aligned with tone and character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically elegant, the story uses metaphor, setting, and sensory detail with purpose; the symbolism of the prism is especially effective, though the ending feels slightly too clean.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Very strong originality in setting and metaphor; a few instances of language verge on ornate, and “crisp languor” as tone becomes repetitive, slightly diluting impact, but overall voice is distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Beautifully integrated elements serve a cohesive character journey with uncommon stylistic maturity; minor quibbles with tonal repetition are outweighed by thematic and emotional unity.</comment>
