<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is richly developed with a clear emotional arc—from despair to hope—and his motivations are deeply tied to both his past and symbolic inheritance; however, his internal voice could be more distinct and nuanced for top-tier literary standards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story offers a satisfying progression with a strong thematic throughline and logical cause-effect structure, though the central conflict and resolution risk feeling slightly metaphor-driven rather than grounded in dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater power station is vividly envisioned, with immersive sensory details and symbolic use of bioluminescence; atmosphere strongly reinforces tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and thematic resonance are strong, particularly in the quilt and stamps metaphor; some transitions verge on overly lyrical, diluting tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Style is elegant with fresh metaphors and emotional subtlety; there’s minor risk of bordering on abstract in places, and a slightly too neat alignment of symbols suggests craft over spontaneity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive premise handled with emotional depth and artistic coherence; the story lingers intellectually and emotionally, though it narrowly avoids overwriting in moments.</comment>
