<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct and thoughtfully rendered character; her contradictions (lethargically energetic) drive the story’s pacing and internal momentum, and her arc from seeker to teacher is well aligned with her actions and voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Despite the abstract theme, the story has a clear arc and resolution tied to a symbolic and emotional journey rather than traditional plot points; pacing is deliberate but effective within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The acid rain forest is vividly imagined and richly sensory; it powerfully reinforces the tone and Mira’s transformation, and builds a striking world in a few well-chosen details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, effective symbolism, and poignant metaphors give the story emotional resonance and thematic coherence; a few phrases verge on poetic excess, but the craft feels authorial rather than algorithmic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story largely avoids cliché and demonstrates originality in both concept and execution; it uses metaphor and paradox creatively and with thematic purpose, though the feather moment is slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This is a cohesive, emotionally intelligent piece that integrates its elements with subtlety and care; its brevity feels purposeful and its theme enduring, though it leaves room for deeper character interaction.</comment>
