<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza’s character is sharply defined—her exaggerated politeness layered over rebellious curiosity gives her a distinctive voice and drives the narrative choices. Her motivation is clearly established and consistent throughout, though secondary emotional depth could be explored more.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced within the word constraint, effectively linking the beginning (Eliza’s intrusion) to the climax (crystal backlash) and resolution (her retreat). Some transitions (e.g. device activation to chaos) could be slightly smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is richly imagined, with sensory details and underlying metaphysics tied to setting and plot. The convergence of setting, object, tone, and atmosphere strongly supports narrative immersion and tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stylish prose, strong tension, and thematic consistency elevate the story. The tonal contrast between politeness and horror is well-executed, though the ending leans toward atmospheric over narrative resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Displays a fresh voice, clever integration of magical and mundane (laundry, hearing aid), and minimal reliance on clichés. Language is vivid yet purposeful, with few signs of formulaic construction or AI rigidity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong overall cohesion and inventive synthesis of elements create a memorable story. A few opportunities for deeper emotional resonance and tighter thematic closure remain, but the impact lingers effectively.</comment>
