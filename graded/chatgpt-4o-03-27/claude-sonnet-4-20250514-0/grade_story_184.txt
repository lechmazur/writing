<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira is vividly drawn with a strong internal drive; her emotional arc from resignation to transcendence is clear and well-earned, though slightly melodramatic at moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc flows logically with a satisfying transformation, but some transitions—especially the leap to the randomized universe—are abrupt and under-explained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels original and avoids cliché, with vivid, specific details and a distinct voice, but occasional phrasing verges on ornate or overly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and imaginative; the story feels complete and layered, though slightly strained in its attempt to compress a vast narrative within tight constraints.</comment>
