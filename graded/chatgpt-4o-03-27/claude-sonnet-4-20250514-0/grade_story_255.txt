<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya feels fully realized with a distinct analytical mindset and emotional undercurrent—the link between her methodical nature and seer-like perception is well integrated; her motivation is credible and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc unfolds smoothly with clear stakes and purpose, though the middle leans on exposition rather than tension-building action; ending provides satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative use of setting and sensory detail—with rain, scent, and decay—works in tandem with tone and theme, grounding the story in a haunting atmosphere that amplifies the tension and mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong literary craft, especially in metaphor and symbolism (constellations, rain as purging), and a restrained emotional current; lacks a bit of dialogue/movement but compensates with reflective depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mostly avoids clichés with fresh imagery ("taste of rain and redemption"), and emotional responses feel human; mild repetition in tone and phrasing barely undercuts its originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive, thematically rich, and stylistically mature; tension builds naturally and resolves meaningfully without melodrama—lingers emotionally and intellectually despite brevity.</comment>
