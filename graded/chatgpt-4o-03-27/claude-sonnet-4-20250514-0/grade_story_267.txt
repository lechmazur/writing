<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus is distinct, with a quiet resolve that deepens as the story progresses, but some emotional beats feel lightly handled rather than fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story maintains logical flow with a clear arc and satisfying resolution, though transitions between discoveries could be slightly tighter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong originality and a confident, human-feeling voice throughout; a few moments lean toward mystical vagueness rather than precise emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and emotionally resonant; it lingers but could refine a few transitions and metaphors for maximum impact.</comment>
