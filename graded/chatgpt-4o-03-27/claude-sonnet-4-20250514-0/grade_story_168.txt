<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera is sharply defined through her ruthless precision, speech, and actions, with clear motivations and a consistent demeanor that drives the plot; Marcus complements her well, but his character is less thoroughly explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and satisfying, with logical escalation and resolution; the spontaneous road trip and stone circle investigation are well-paced, though high-concept elements strain realism slightly.</comment>
