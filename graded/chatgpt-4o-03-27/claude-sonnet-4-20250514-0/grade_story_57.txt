<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pemberton's character is rich with contradiction—privileged yet reluctant, bumbling yet perceptive, submissive yet subversive—creating internal coherence and emotional depth. His motivation to protect Sophia aligns with his history and is expressed through subtly heroic action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story arcs cleanly from mundane setup to moral decision and covert action. Cause and effect are tight, and the plot progression is logical and satisfying within the constraints. Slight pacing compression near the climax costs it perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with the setting cleverly juxtaposing aristocratic absurdity and espionage tension. Details like the echoing walls and the potting shed’s disguise are vividly evoked to support tone and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story shows rather than tells, builds tension subtly, and lands with quiet emotional weight. The use of irony, voice, and symbolism (the letter opener) enriches the narrative. A compact, resonant ending seals it effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar tropes are employed with originality and satirical edge. The voice is distinct, witty, and human. Language is sharp without excess, and the narrative feels crafted rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cleverly layered, emotionally resonant story that feels complete and distinctive. The elements serve the narrative rather than the reverse, and the voice elevates the material significantly.</comment>
