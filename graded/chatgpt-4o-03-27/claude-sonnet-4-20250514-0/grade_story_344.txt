<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina is well-realized, with her claustrophobia, scientific rigor, and emotional arc consistently informing her actions and responses; Celeste’s “lightly heavyhearted” demeanor is subtler but evocative, though their dynamic could use slightly more contrast or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, emotionally complete, and elegantly structured for the word limit, with a satisfying transformation arc anchored by a clear beginning, middle, and revelation-driven end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is striking and atmospherically rich, using sensory detail—particularly taste and scent—to immerse the reader; the floating tea house and abyssal backdrop reinforce the emotional and thematic tone masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance, layered symbolism (preserves = preserved memory = healing), and a memorable thematic throughline; some phrasing is slightly overwrought but mostly purposefully poetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The jam-as-memory-tasting mechanic is highly original; metaphors and emotional shifts feel earned and nuanced, with little sign of formulaic construction or trope reliance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, original tale that harmonizes all elements with care and inventiveness; while not flawless, it is unusually strong in tone, emotional depth, and thematic unity for a compact narrative.</comment>
