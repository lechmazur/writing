<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is strong and consistent, with her passion for heritage driving the plot, though her emotional depth and voice could benefit from more nuance and variation beyond stated determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and satisfying resolution; however, the mechanism of the changing passage strains plausibility slightly and the sticky note feels underdeveloped as a guiding device.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Well-structured and thematically unified, but lacks the stylistic sharpness, emotional subtlety, or originality required for top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
