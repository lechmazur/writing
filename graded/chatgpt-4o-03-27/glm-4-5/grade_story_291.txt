<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The captain’s motivation is compelling and clearly tied to her backstory; the frayed rope serves as a strong symbolic anchor, though her voice lacks just a bit more individuality or emotional nuance to reach the highest level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive structural coherence within the word limit, building a steady arc from the captain’s entry to her emergence, though a slightly more dramatic pivot or unexpected twist would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted mirror maze and orchard setting are richly atmospheric and metaphorically resonant with the theme of internal confrontation, successfully maintaining tone and sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., rope, maze, mirrors) enhances the emotional and thematic depth; subtlety in subtext is handled with skill, though emotional stakes could be rendered with more immediacy for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story avoids formula and shows ambition in language and symbolism, but occasional phrases lean toward overelaboration or abstraction, slightly undercutting the emotional clarity and human texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive, thoughtful, and emotionally resonant; combines elements with intelligence and thematic focus, though a final moment of surprise or sharper tension would push it to peak literary excellence.</comment>
