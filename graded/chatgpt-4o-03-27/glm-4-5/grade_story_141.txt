<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The characterâ€™s superstition and scientific duality are introduced clearly and drive key decisions, but his deeper emotional transformation is told rather than shown, limiting full dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scavenger hunt to supernatural revelation arc is coherent and satisfying, though the scavenger hunt setup is underdeveloped and fades too quickly for full structural payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overall, a compelling synthesis of mystical and scientific; minor inconsistencies and surface-level exposition hold it back from elite literary polish.</comment>
