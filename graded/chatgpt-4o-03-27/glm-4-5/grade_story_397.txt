<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The character’s motivations are clearly rooted in personal loss and obsession, and his actions align with his jaded yet determined personality; while emotionally compelling, deeper nuances or contradictions could elevate the complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a strong central arc—search, discovery, and decision—but the pacing feels slightly rushed in resolving the crystal’s revelation, and some leaps (such as the method’s leap to a glowing crystal map) stretch internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal laboratory setting, paired with New Year's fireworks, creates a compelling, evocative atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist’s emotional conflict and surreal discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (glowing crystal, bloodied scalpel, doodled receipts) enriches the narrative and evokes a sense of mystery and longing; though affecting, the emotional stakes could deepen with more tension or ambiguity at the conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The writing avoids cliché and handles the surreal concept with originality and voice; a few transitions feel slightly too neat or mechanical, but overall, the piece demonstrates individual style and control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Creatively combines disparate elements into a cohesive whole with emotional weight and a haunting atmosphere; while not flawless, the fusion of memory, mystery, and method suggests a mature literary sensibility.</comment>
