<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lord Ashworth’s motivation is clearly tied to his background, and his arc from duty-driven to self-discovery is emotionally effective, though his “voice” lacks distinctiveness and the internal tension could be dramatized more richly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and satisfying, with a clear transformation and thematic payoff, but the transition into the surreal coaster sequence is slightly rushed and lacks grounding in concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically coherent, with strong symbolism and a satisfying resolution; however, certain moments feel more told than shown, which slightly blunts the full literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>There is originality in the surreal tone and botanical device, though some phrasings veer toward ornate, and slightly formulaic transitions weaken the sense of a singular authorial style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story blends its many elements with impressive cohesion and evokes lingering reflections, but a few moments feel overdetermined rather than naturally emergent from character and setting.</comment>
