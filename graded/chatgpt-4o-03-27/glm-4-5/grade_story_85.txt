<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The swordsman's inner transformation is conceptually strong, but his personality remains too abstract and passive—his voice is muted, with limited emotional nuance in reaction to discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and reflective, but lacks strong dramatic propulsion—cause-effect sequences are more thematic than narrative, softening impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with admirable thematic unity, but leans heavily on mood at the expense of narrative urgency and character depth.</comment>
