<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The landlord is consistently portrayed as kind, grounded, and driven by purpose, but emotional depth is thin, and his "voice" lacks uniqueness; the designer character remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The structure is coherent and ends with resolution, but the central conflict—the parade detour—is weak and lacks sufficient narrative tension to fully engage the reader.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The studio is vividly drawn, and imagery like skylights and sketches of futures enhances atmosphere; however, the "timeless" setting remains abstract and under-integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The piece avoids clichés and shows stylistic consistency, yet over-formal prose and occasionally robotic phrasing dilute the human feel of the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Well-intentioned and quietly poignant, but lacks dramatic tension or memorable narrative turns; strong symbolic structure but not quite compelling enough for top-tier publication.</comment>
