<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a compelling arc with rising stakes and a satisfying conclusion, but the pacing sometimes borders on rushed due to dense worldbuilding compressed into the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk observatory is richly imagined with strong sensory details, and the atmospheric elements—like the shifting coffee shop walls—heighten the mood and support the story’s themes effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice, stars, walls) is thoughtfully layered, and the story has emotional resonance and thematic depth, though the dialogue and climax could be sharper for full literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché through its genre fusion and fresh metaphors, though a few phrases marginally veer toward ornate; emotional nuance is generally strong but could be more subtly dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imaginative, cohesive, and unified in tone, the story integrates its elements well and leaves a memorable final image, though minor overcompression in places limits emotional buildup.</comment>
