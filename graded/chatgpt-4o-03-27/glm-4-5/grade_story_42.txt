<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and redemption arc are compelling and reasonably consistent, but his emotional depth is more implied than shown; the internal struggle could be rendered more vividly for a top-tier execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying, with a solid climax and resolution; however, the skirmish feels slightly rushed and could use more buildup to enhance narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and deeply atmospheric, with strong sensory cues and symbolism that reinforce the theme; the turbines and cliffside temple feel integral rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story succeeds in evoking emotion and symbolism, particularly through the pen and wind imagery, though the resolution leans toward exposition over visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mostly original with strong metaphors, but certain phrases ("resigned exuberance") feel repeated and a few moments drift toward poetic clich√© rather than precision or freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves thematic resonance and emotional closure within tight constraints, though subtlety and nuance in character expression could elevate it further.</comment>
