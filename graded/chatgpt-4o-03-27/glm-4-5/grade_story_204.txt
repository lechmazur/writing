<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inner transformation Maya undergoes is thematically rich and well-motivated; her prejudice, professional detachment, and eventual shift are all credibly intertwined, though Leo remains more symbolic than dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Though largely reflective and internal, the plot has a coherent trajectory from prejudice to acceptance, with strong thematic unity; however, the lack of external conflict limits dynamism and tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The decaying spaceport hangar powerfully mirrors internal character decay and emotional rebirth; the setting is vivid and symbolically potent, enhancing tone and concept beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story balances metaphor and introspection with restraint, using the phantom punch as a poignant symbol of emotional validation, though the absence of dialogue or physical action lessens narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clich√©s and delivers fresh metaphor, its occasional lyrical repetition and slight over-formality suggest moments of stylization that border on mechanical; more character texture would elevate it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegantly composed and resonant, the story ends with emotional clarity and coherence, though a fuller depiction of Leo would lend greater balance and depth to the theme of interconnection.</comment>
