<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The deserter’s motivation is deeply embedded in his symbolism-driven rituals; the emotional arc is clear and consistent, though his ‘voice’ could be more individuated amid the reflective prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc through cyclical reflection and metaphorical resolution, though the pacing flirts with stagnation in its meditative tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and metaphor, with remarkably few formulaic cues—language is poetic yet mostly purposeful and avoids AI-flavored abstraction or cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story weaves abstract elements into a surprisingly cohesive whole; the themes linger, and the stylistic choices are largely deliberate rather than compensatory.</comment>
