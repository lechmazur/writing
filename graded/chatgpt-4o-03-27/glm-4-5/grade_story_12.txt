<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The cartographer's transition from aloofness to connection is conceptually sound but too quickly resolved; his emotional arc lacks sufficient layering or resistance to feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but its midsection leans heavily on exposition, slowing narrative momentum and diluting emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The futuristic mall is a vivid, conceptually rich setting, but it is underutilized; stronger sensory immersion and specificity would elevate atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The metaphors (tile, kayaking, memory) are resonant and thematically aligned, but lack of tension and over-explained symbolism flatten emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some phrases feel abstract or recycled ("language of the soul", "crystalized in its matrix"), and kayaking as metaphor feels more conceptual than organically embedded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically coherent, but the lack of tension and emotional unpredictability makes it feel more like allegory than lived experience.</comment>
