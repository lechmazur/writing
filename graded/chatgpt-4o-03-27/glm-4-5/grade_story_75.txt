<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The character is distinctive and her guarded, skeptically credulous nature is consistent and well-integrated with her quest, though her emotional arc remains mostly internal and could benefit from more externalized transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot forms a coherent arc and ends decisively, but the method of decrypting wedding vows as a mechanism for unlocking knowledge strains logic and remains largely metaphorical, weakening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The nano-forest is described with vivid, poetic imagery that effectively contrasts with the character’s emotional and thematic conflict; it enhances the atmospheric tension without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story’s message is compelling and the imagery symbolic, but the emotional stakes aren’t sharply felt—there's more telling than showing, and the writing skirts deeper complexity in favor of lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The allegorical tone is original and avoids blatant tropes, but some phrases feel overly ornate or ambiguous; parts of the text read like concept-first writing rather than lived experience or emotional logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically ambitious, but some conceptual elements feel forced or underdeveloped, and the prose style occasionally clouds narrative clarity with abstraction.</comment>
