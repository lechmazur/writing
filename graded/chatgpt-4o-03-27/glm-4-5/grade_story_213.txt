<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivations are clear and consistent, and her decisive actions align with her sense of duty and secrecy. However, the characterization lacks depth beyond her role—she remains more symbol than person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is cleanly resolved within the word limit. Cause-and-effect flows are logical and the story achieves an elegant circularity, though the pacing slightly rushes the climax for emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of a wedding and secret science adds intrigue, and some vivid background detail supports mood. Still, the setting could benefit from stronger sensory immersion and more dynamic integration with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story’s central metaphor is powerful and well-developed. The final image is emotionally and thematically resonant, though some moments lapse into telling rather than showing, slightly weakening narrative immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise is highly original and the twist is imaginative. However, scattered phrasing feels slightly overwritten, and some metaphors verge on vagueness rather than precision, suggesting occasional formulaic influence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overall, a compelling, self-contained piece with high-concept originality and cohesive integration of elements, but slightly hindered by underdeveloped character depth and minor stylistic lapses.</comment>
