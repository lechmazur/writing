<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s core transformation is conceptually strong, but her initial rashness is told rather than shown, and the shift in motivation happens too abruptly to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and complete within the word limit, but the central action—the encounter—feels too convenient and lacks tension, reducing overall plot dynamism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and aligns well with the mood; sensory details are evocative and reinforce the themes of isolation and transcendence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic exploration and poetic prose elevate the story’s resonance, though occasional exposition undermines the subtlety needed for literary excellence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and offers a fresh metaphorical interpretation, but some language veers into overwrought territory and the "cosmic map" revelation feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion and emotional resolution, but its literary merit would improve with deeper justification for the protagonist’s epiphany and less reliance on exposition.</comment>
