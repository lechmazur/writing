<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The necromancer is imbued with some personality through his love for old movies and his connection to his mentor, but his emotional arc lacks depth; motivations are stated clearly but not deeply explored through action or tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and avoids major logical flaws, but it lacks complexity or strong narrative momentum; stakes remain low and largely internalized, limiting dramatic engagement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly described and thematically tied to the magical undertones and tone of nostalgic futurism; sensory details particularly in light and sound are effective, though tactile and olfactory cues are missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some originality in the magical-old cinema fusion and atmospheric consistency, but occasional phrases feel mechanical or overly polished; lacks the unpredictability of human expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and competent execution, but lacks the distinction or emotional weight to stand out at the highest literary level; more refinement in voice and tension needed.</comment>
