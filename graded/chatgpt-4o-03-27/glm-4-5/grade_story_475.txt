<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While original in combination, some phrasing is overly ornate or imprecise, and metaphoric density verges on excess, making the story feel slightly artificial despite its ambition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and creatively assembled with a purposeful tone, but its emotional detachment and vague internal logic prevent it from truly excelling.</comment>
