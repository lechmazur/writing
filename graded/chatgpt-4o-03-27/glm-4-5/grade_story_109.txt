<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sir Aldricâ€™s transformation from emotionally detached knight to nurturing figure is effectively developed; his motivations are clear and evolve organically through the discovery of the mitten, though his "lawfully rebellious" trait is underexplored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure presents a clear arc with a satisfying resolution, though transitions between internal realization and external action could be smoother, and the folk remedies subplot feels slightly under-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story weaves mood and setting well, with effective use of sensory detail (cold air, night silence, wool texture); the secret agent center is more symbolic than fully realized but contributes to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolism (mitten as heart, altar as connection) deepen the emotional resonance; the storytelling shows strong craft and subtle subtext, though themes are sometimes stated too directly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original metaphorical use of objects and understated emotional evolution elevate it; occasional overwriting and slightly formulaic phrasing detract from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story feels intentional and cohesive, using its elements to support a nuanced theme; emotionally satisfying and stylistically strong, though not quite transcendent in its execution.</comment>
