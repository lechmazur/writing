<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The apprentice's literal mind and unwavering focus are consistent and compelling, but his emotional dimension feels underdeveloped, limiting deeper empathy or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story arc is clear and purposeful, with a satisfying resolution; however, the middle narrative leans too heavily on exposition over dynamic progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elegant integration of assigned elements with fresh metaphorical resonance, though some phrasing risks convention and the overly logical narrative edges into inhuman detachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inventive, stylistically coherent, and thematically resonant; slightly hindered by emotional flatness and minor repetition, but broadly strong in execution and originality.</comment>
