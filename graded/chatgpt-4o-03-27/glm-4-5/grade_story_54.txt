<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The smuggler is presented with consistency and intrigue through their temperament and code, but emotional depth and internal conflict are underdeveloped beyond the unsent letter motif.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and has a subtle arc, but lacks substantial conflict, stakes, or escalation to fully engage; pacing is solid though the resolution feels emotionally muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some unique imagery and metaphors lift the prose, but repetition, occasional vagueness, and lack of emotional nuance detract from freshness and true originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imaginative premise and stylistic consistency give the story form, but lack of character-layering, true tension, and deeper emotional payoff hold it back from top-tier publication readiness.</comment>
