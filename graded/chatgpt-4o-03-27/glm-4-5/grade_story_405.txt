<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivations are clear and emotionally grounded, with the petal collection and sister's disappearance informing his every action. However, his identity as a "skeptical gambler" is underdeveloped, with scant reflection of this trait in his current choices or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative builds toward a satisfying culmination, connecting Marcus’s grief and obsession with a sense of resolution. The arc is coherent and well-paced, though slightly strained by the number of elements being juggled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined, with sensory details—glow-mushrooms, subterranean corridors—heightening the atmosphere and supporting themes of loss and isolation. Strong immersion elevates both tone and worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively evokes grief, desperation, and fragile hope. Symbolism (petals, scrawls) is thematically rich. The final image resonates, though certain emotions are occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and shows inventive element integration. Some phrasing edges toward purple prose, and a few metaphors feel derivative rather than fresh, slightly weakening the originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, narrative ambition, and emotional resonance. While a few elements feel slightly tacked on or underexplored, the story succeeds in weaving disparate parts into a compelling whole.</comment>
