<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pirate radio operator is vividly drawn, his stoicism and layered motivations well supported by consistent actions and specific internal monologue; however, the beekeeper is underdeveloped and functions more as a device than a full character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a cohesive arc and emotional resolution within the word limit, though the inciting event (finding the wallet) feels a touch too convenient, and the climax arrives with minimal tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the beekeeper's sanctuary is evocative and rich, enhancing both theme and tone, though it borders on the overly idyllic and symbolic at times.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story effectively uses symbolism (paper plane, static), delivers emotional resonance, and showcases stylistic flair; however, it occasionally leans into telling rather than showing, particularly at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the narrative avoids generic phrasing and produces fresh metaphors, the tone lapses into overly ornate prose at times, and a few emotional beats feel more constructed than naturally emergent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is thoughtful, thematically cohesive, and emotionally resonant, with creative use of elements, though a slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction prevents it from reaching full clarity or raw impact.</comment>
