<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The main character is consistent and thematically rich, but lacks emotional depth and individuality beyond archetype; his motivation is clear, yet his personality never fully crystallizes into a memorable figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with an effective resolution, but the pacing occasionally lags due to repetitive phrasing, and some transitions feel overly ornamental rather than organically driven by narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues and a compelling mood of isolation and wonder, though some imagery borders on repetitive or abstract rather than grounding the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional resonance and lyrical prose, but leans on telling over showing in key emotional beats; the central tension is diffuse, and the symbolism, though ambitious, verges on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>There is strong originality in concept and metaphor, but some phrases feel more like poetic flourishes than lived-in details, and elements like “savage grace” and “intangibly tangible” strain credibility or clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Despite stylistic excess and minor abstraction, the story is cohesive and thematically rich, with enough emotional and conceptual depth to linger in the reader's mind, though not yet at a publishable polish.</comment>
