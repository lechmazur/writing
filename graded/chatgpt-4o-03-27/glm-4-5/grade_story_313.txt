<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Jasper's arc is compelling and coherent, with clear motivation rooted in guilt; his actions and voice align with his background, but could use a touch more emotional nuance and contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure maintains a satisfying arc with effective pacing and resolution, though the nightly ritual risks slight repetitiveness near the end without significant progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric world is richly rendered with strong sensory details and a consistent tone; the dystopian setting and ghostly apparitions support the character's internal and external conflict well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh approach to guilt and atonement via spectral dialogue; strong originality and voice, though a few phrasings risk bordering on elevated clich√©s.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A powerful and cohesive story with layered meaning, creative use of elements, and a haunting emotional payoff; minor polish would elevate it to elite tier.</comment>
