<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gambler's descent into corruption is plausible and emotionally resonant, but his motivations—initially noble—are not deeply explored or psychologically complex, and his transformation feels somewhat cursory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arc from hope to downfall has a clear progression, and the action of duplication drives events well; however, the ending’s emotional payoff is undermined by a rushed middle and some ambiguity in cause-effect transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost town and schoolhouse are evoked with compelling sensory detail and a haunting atmosphere; the setting beautifully complements the theme and tone, richly enhancing the mood throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story has originality in concept and tone, but several phrases and transitions feel overly polished or generic, with some emotional beats conveyed through telling rather than showing nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A strong thematic vision and atmospheric craft carry the story, but its reliance on an archetypal descent arc and structural familiarity limit its potential for true literary distinction.</comment>
