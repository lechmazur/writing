<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, and his absent-mindedness is more than quirk—it shapes his motivation and adds complexity to his emotional arc. Dialogue and internal logic align well, but Dr. Thorne remains underdeveloped as a character foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, organic resolution, and effective pacing. The initial anecdote with the knocker bookends the journey nicely. A touch more narrative tension could have heightened stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-AI world is compellingly sketched with immersive sensory details and a melancholy tone that elevates the atmosphere. The setting amplifies theme and mood without overshadowing character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant, thematically rich, and layered with literary devices like metaphor and symbolism. Some dialogue edges toward abstraction, but the story lingers thoughtfully and ends with satisfying poignancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and well-integrated elements avoid cliché; subtle subversions and a consistent narrative voice offer originality. A few phrases verge on overwritten but don't detract significantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally compelling. Every component serves a unified thematic vision. A rare example of high-concept fiction contained gracefully within a short form.</comment>
