<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Jax's motivations are stated but not deeply shown through behavior; the emotional transition from "sadly joyful" to "truly joyful" is abrupt and lacks sufficient development or internal struggle to feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the inciting call and the twist (lost Thai cookbook) feel overly convenient, with underdeveloped cause-effect logic that weakens narrative believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted park setting is atmospherically strong with effective sensory detail—dust, creaking, gloom—but could be further integrated into the story's emotional stakes and themes beyond surface-level eeriness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some symbolism (knife, haunted house) begins to emerge, but the emotional payoff is rushed; opportunities for rich thematic layering and character conflict are glossed over in favor of a tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the tone and setting offer potential, the story leans on an overly neat twist (cookbook) and abrupt turn to positivity, with predictable beats and minimal subversion—undercutting originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and hits its required beats, but lacks depth and surprise; it gestures toward emotional change and community-building without truly delving into complexity or ambiguity.</comment>
