<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The android's personality is effectively defined by its nostalgia and emerging consciousness; its motivations are consistent and compelling, though lacking emotional depth or complexity in voice that could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story follows a clear arc with logical cause and effect, and the crisis drives coherent action; the pacing is tight and mostly well-managed, but a richer climax or more layered resolution would enhance it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative evokes quiet pathos and moral weight, with effective symbolism (e.g. telescope, crystals), though some metaphors verge on being slightly ornamental rather than fully integral.</comment>
