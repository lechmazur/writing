<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation evolves meaningfully, and his transformation is clearly tied to past failures, but the emotional depth and psychological nuance feel underdeveloped, with some cliched internal shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent structure with a clear arc, but the shift from survival tale to metaphysical mission feels slightly abrupt and under-explored in such a compact word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and imaginative, especially the "insect symphony hall," but some sensory details (touch, taste, smell) are underutilized, leaving parts of the world less immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism and metaphors like "bitter honey" are evocative, and the arc has emotional resonance, yet the writing depends too heavily on lofty abstraction rather than specific, grounded moments to fully land the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The plot attempts originality, but several transitions and concepts (e.g., ancient knowledge, guardian stranger) echo familiar tropes without fresh subversion or deeply human nuance, weakening authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative incorporates all elements and forms a coherent whole, but the voice lacks individuality, and the emotional resolution feels more conceptual than earned through fully realized drama.</comment>
