<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The minstrel is clearly drawn and consistent in motivation, with his yearning for silence and transformation; however, his "openly private" trait remains underexplored and lightly integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc from disillusionment through transformation to resolution, but the meteorite surface method feels underexplained and a touch abstract, causing a faint drop in logical clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong subtext and a poetic style elevate the story's emotional resonance, though slight over-reliance on exposition over action in key moments dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative pushes beyond tropes with fresh imagery and uniqueness in tone, but the metaphor of the meteorite texture feels slightly forced, limiting full authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, purposeful, and leaves a lasting impression—though a bit more specificity in the metaphor’s role would strengthen the whole.</comment>
