<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The baker's character is vivid and paradoxical, his cynically gentle persona well-integrated with his revolutionary motive; however, emotional depth and development over time are somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc with elegant cause-effect links, though the climax—involving time travel—feels slightly rushed and more conceptually gestured at than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world is richly rendered; the interplay of shadows, flowers, flour, and lunar tracking creates an immersive and atmospheric backdrop that reinforces the character’s motive and mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>While fairly original overall, the story occasionally treads close to stylistic cliché (e.g., “mixing dough and destiny”), but largely avoids formulaic patterns or AI-like constructions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is imaginative and well-balanced in theme, mood, and character, leaving a lingering impression; minor issues with clarity and structure keep it from perfection.</comment>
