<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias is distinctly drawn, with clear motivations aligned to his wistful demeanor and artistic obsessions; though consistent, his internal arc lacks a notable evolution or tension that would elevate character depth further within this brief space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative holds coherence and a complete arc within the word limit, with a satisfying thematic resolution; however, it leans more on atmosphere than active plot movement, which slightly flattens dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story resists formula and cliché, with fresh imagery and inventive integration of elements; prose is occasionally close to ornate but maintains focus and originality throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic integration and a cohesive vision lend the story a lasting impression; slight lack of narrative propulsion tempers the score but does not undercut the deeply crafted core.</comment>
