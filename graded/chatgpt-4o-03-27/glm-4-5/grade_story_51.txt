<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is clearly and consistently rendered, with motivations and emotional nuance tightly tied to his past and present actions; his voice feels distinct and sincere, though the dialogue occasionally leans toward thematic exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story moves fluidly with a clear arc within the word limit, and the museum meeting method grounds the narrative progression; however, the resolution feels slightly hurried and leans on coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is a vivid, metaphorically rich setting that enhances mood and theme; sensory elements are subtle but effective, and the place feels integral rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional resonance, layered symbolism (e.g., the crate slat), and a satisfying thematic arc; occasional phrasing veers toward the abstract, dimming otherwise strong subtextual craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Though a few moments risk clich√© (e.g., the symbolic object exchange), overall the story maintains originality, especially in its emotional grounding and the inventive museum-staging method.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive, the story integrates its complex elements without feeling mechanistic; though not flawless, it leaves a reflective emotional imprint and displays strong literary promise.</comment>
