<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivations are surreal but emotionally consistent, his internal conflict well-articulated through symbolism; however, his "humorless comedic actor" identity never meaningfully impacts his choices or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a dreamlike arc with coherent emotional progression; cause and effect within the metaphorical frame works, but the action lacks grounded narrative tension or obstacles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The surreal playground-wilderness liminal space is evocative, layered with cosmic imagery and rich sensory language that immerses the reader in a melancholic, timeless atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical, with emotionally resonant metaphors and satisfying resolution; depth in symbolism is strong, but repetition of abstract themes slightly dulls narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and subtext give originality, but some phrases verge on overwrought or generically poetic; the overall presentation avoids clich√©s but risks abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Despite its abstract tone, the story holds together with emotional cohesion and thematic resonance; the integration of elements feels organic, though the surrealism may alienate some readers.</comment>
