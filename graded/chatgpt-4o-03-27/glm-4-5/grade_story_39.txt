<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias has a consistent motivation tied to his background as a tailor, and his endurance is clear; however, he lacks psychological depth and nuance, especially given his key trait of being ‘earnestly deceptive.’</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively cohesive and complete for the word limit; the lantern's activation drives the story, though some transitions feel too convenient or glossed over mechanically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The biodome on Mars and the mysterious atmosphere are vivid and immersive; sensory detail is sparse but well-chosen, though the setting could be used even more dynamically to reinforce Elias's isolation and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and themes give it impact, and the conclusion is emotionally satisfying; however, the storytelling leans on telling rather than showing at key moments, muting potential poignancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Inventive premise overall, but certain phrases ("ephemeral cameo appearances") feel AI-generated or overly ornate, and some emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>There’s a compelling vision and emotional throughline, but not all elements harmonize equally; some narrative flourishes feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
