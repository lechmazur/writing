<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus is compelling and thematically rich, but lacks distinct voice or meaningful dialogue that would elevate his psychological depth beyond monologue-like narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-structured and coherent, with a clear transformation, but the handshake climactic moment feels symbolic rather than dramatically earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious, emotionally thoughtful, and largely cohesive; a few moments feel slightly overwritten, but overall depth is achieved.</comment>
