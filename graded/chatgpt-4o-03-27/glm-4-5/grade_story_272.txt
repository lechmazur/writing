<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The character is distinct and his internal drive is evident, but his development is somewhat static—he begins and ends with the same social awkwardness, and the emotional transformation lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and completes a full arc, but the stakes remain abstract and the progression through the archive feels conveniently smooth rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The diner setting and nighttime solitude effectively support mood and character psychology; atmospheric details are sparse but cleanly integrated and evocative without overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The metaphors and symbolism (tree of regret, reversed trails) are intriguing but verge on overuse; emotional impact is mild due to a lack of vivid conflict or change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The idea shows promise, but some phrases and transitions feel overly neat or generic; while not overtly cliché, it lacks the texture of truly original voice or deeply human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, conceptually complete story, but doesn’t fully transcend the mechanical execution—the emotional imprint is light despite solid thematic construction.</comment>
