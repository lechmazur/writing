<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is consistent and emotionally resonant, though his personality lacks sharp differentiation beyond "unsettled;" more distinct voice or internal conflict could deepen engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and coherent within the word limit, with elegant cause-effect transitions; slight ambiguity in the shell's transformation reduces clarity in an otherwise tightly structured story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically potent, with a graceful narrative arc and imaginative execution; minor stylistic overreach mildly detracts from clarity.</comment>
