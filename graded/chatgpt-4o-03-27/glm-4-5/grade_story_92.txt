<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct with clear motivations rooted in greed and obsession, though emotional depth and evolution are limited; the 'carefully careless' trait is suggested but not fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The structure is mostly coherent with a consistent arc, but tension peaks too early, and the resolution (promise of theft) feels underdeveloped within the word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thoughtfully woven elements and mood-forward storytelling deliver a cohesive and intriguing narrative, though not compelling enough for top-tier placement without revision.</comment>
