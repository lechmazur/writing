<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative is cohesive and propulsive, with a well-defined arc from mystery to resolution, though the abstract concept of “unwritten paths” becomes tenuously literal at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and supports the protagonist’s internal and external journey; the tunnel and well imagery are evocatively used to reinforce tone and mystery.</comment>
