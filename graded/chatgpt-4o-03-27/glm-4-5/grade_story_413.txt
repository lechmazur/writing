<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair's personality as a listless, naively sophisticated noble is well integrated and consistent; however, his transformation feels overly reliant on a single interaction, making his arc feel a touch unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a clear arc—beginning with listlessness, climaxing at the encounter, and ending with transformation—but the pacing is uneven, and the resolution borders on sentimental cliché.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thoughtful use of assigned elements with an ambitious theme; while not flawless, the narrative shows cohesion, creativity, and emotional resonance that could be polished for high-level publication.</comment>
