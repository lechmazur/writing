<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established early and reflected in her actions, but her internal voice lacks complexity beyond awe and purpose; deeper emotional nuance is needed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc with a beginning, transformation, and resolution, though the pacing flattens slightly near the climax, and cause-effect links could be more dynamically rendered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Displays cohesion and subtle depth with artful use of assigned elements, though not yet refined enough in voice, pacing, or emotional tension for top-tier publication.</comment>
