<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vigilante's motivation—to master an ancient art as atonement for the price of war—is clear and mostly consistent, though his emotional depth and personal voice remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the arc is conceptually present, the story relies heavily on repetition and mood over decisive narrative momentum; the resolution is more spiritual than plot-driven, which may alienate some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned waiting area and “screaming silence” establish a vivid, immersive atmosphere enhanced by surreal mirror imagery; sensory detail is sparse but effective where used.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story explores interesting symbolic and thematic terrain, but the emotional impact is dulled by abstract phrasing and repeated structural cadences that hinder narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>There are moments of originality in the mirror-tracking method and clumsy movement conceit, but reliance on archetypal phrases and slightly generic mystique undercuts uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story achieves cohesion and a deliberate tone, but overuses certain motifs (mirror, silence, bead) without pushing their narrative boundaries; the ending is quiet rather than revelatory.</comment>
