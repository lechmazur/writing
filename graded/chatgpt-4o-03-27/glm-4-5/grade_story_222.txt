<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The conjurer’s motivations are present and his actions consistent, but his “philosophically shallow” trait is more told than shown and limits emotional complexity; he lacks depth beyond function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot progresses cleanly from introduction to ritual and resolution, with decent cause and effect, but the arc feels more engineered than earned—conflict is minimal and the resolution too easy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The extraterrestrial embassy and living architecture are evocative and original, with solid sensory detail, though the atmosphere could be deepened with more immersive specifics and sharper contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story attempts layering and metaphor but settles into a literal and somewhat safe execution; the emotional payoff is quiet but lacks the lingering resonance top-tier storytelling evokes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>While not egregiously formulaic, some phrases (“calculated dreams,” “layers of compassion”) feel like hollow motif-dropping; emotional beats are more stated than felt, with little surprise or subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and competent, showing clear intent, but falls short of exceptional due to safe plotting, underdeveloped theme, and minimal dramatic tension—it engages but doesn’t haunt.</comment>
