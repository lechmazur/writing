<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's emotional struggle and motivation to reclaim her muse are clearly defined, though her internal voice lacks distinctiveness and depth beyond archetypal "tortured artist" traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Excellent structural arc with a clear and satisfying progression; the compass and pedestal scenes maintain narrative coherence, though the resolution is a touch too tidy given the mystical complexity suggested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some minor overreliance on familiar fantasy elements (enchanted object, guardian spirit), but the fusion of botany and sound art adds freshness; overall avoids major clich√©s with competent prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The piece feels complete, emotionally resonant, and thematically unified; not groundbreaking, but a polished and cohesive literary vignette.</comment>
