<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mercenary’s trembling demeanor, haunted past, and longing for redemption align well with his motivation and the symbolic power of the amber; his personality and method blend believably, though his voice lacks distinction absent first-person depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot forms a coherent emotional arc with beginning, middle, and resolution, but the progression of the “improbable rumor chains” is underdeveloped and the final action feels slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively established with strong sensory details (spray-painted pillars, broken stained glass); the setting enhances both emotional tone and thematic depth, achieving a vivid and immersive mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Symbolism is strong (amber as truth/reckoning), emotional weight is palpable, and subtext around memory and redemption is well-executed, though prose occasionally veers from showing into telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While generally fresh and sincere, the story brushes clichés (haunted past, redemptive object), and occasional phrasing lacks the precision or freshness expected at top-tier literary level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically consistent, and emotionally resonant, with elements purposefully integrated; it leaves a lingering emotional aftertaste, though not quite transcendent or groundbreaking.</comment>
