<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is clear and thematically resonant, but his transformation feels symbolically heavy rather than emotionally grounded; his 'generic' identity is more told than shown, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and escalation, with a mythic quality, but the stakes are abstract and the transition from eerie discovery to mythic ritual is rushed and lacks full grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story avoids blatant cliché and shows conceptual ambition, but some phrases verge on overwrought, and the tone wavers between parody and earnestness without full control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with a strong ending image, but character depth and tonal consistency prevent it from reaching literary excellence.</comment>
