<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conjurer’s personality is vividly drawn through internal reflection, philosophical musings, and a consistency in tone and behavior, though lacking deeper conflict or evolution beyond the ritual’s climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically and resolves clearly within the word count, but feels more atmospheric than dynamic—lacking narrative tension or external conflict that could elevate structural engagement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext, particularly around time, memory, and legacy; however, missing a more surprising or emotionally jarring moment that might cement long-term resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While poetic and conceptually cohesive, some descriptions veer toward vagueness or repetition, and a few turns of phrase feel more stylized than necessary—borderline purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story feels whole and artistically intentional with thematic depth; however, its introspective nature slightly limits narrative vitality or mass appeal—successfully literary, not quite transcendent.</comment>
