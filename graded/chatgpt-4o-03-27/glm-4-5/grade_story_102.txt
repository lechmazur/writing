<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mercenary’s internal conflict and reluctant growth are fairly compelling, but his arc relies too heavily on implication and lacks concrete emotional beats. Elara is promising but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot suggests a mythic journey and ends on a note of action, but the middle lacks tension and feels more like a setup than a complete arc. Cause-and-effect is tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined, with strong sensory details and a cohesive atmosphere of quiet dread and wonder. The observatory and hush effectively deepen mood and theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story feels more like a prologue than a complete narrative, but it artfully combines mystical motifs and hints at deep lore. Its ambition nearly outweighs its uneven execution.</comment>
