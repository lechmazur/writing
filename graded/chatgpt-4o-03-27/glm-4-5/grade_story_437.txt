<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered, his weakness informing both his downfall and empathetic communion with the plants; his motivations are uniquely consistent, though his voice borders on monologue without direct dialogue or interpersonal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story forms a clear internal arc—loss to purpose—but the pacing leans uniform, lacking dynamic tension or pivot; still, there's a meditative coherence that suits the tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is lush, immersive, and integral; the toxic sky, rain, and greenhouse architecture all reinforce Elias’s isolation and delusion, beautifully marrying place and mind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While some turns of phrase risk affectation, the imagery is often fresh and thematically layered; emotional depth is shown with subtlety, though repetition and mild abstraction detract slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegiac tone, integrated elements, and closing catharsis make this feel more like a small gem than an exercise; still, sharper tension or complication would strengthen memorability.</comment>
