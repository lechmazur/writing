<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is clearly motivated and consistent, with his sincerity and purpose well-aligned; Anya’s arc is subtler but effective. However, more depth or complexity in their emotional evolution would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly static—more dynamic tension or escalation would enhance narrative propulsion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and metaphor, but some phrasing feels slightly overworked or abstract, and the emotional nuance could be more grounded in specific, vivid moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thoughtful, cohesive, and thematically rich; the story lingers, though a touch more narrative tension or surprise would push it into top-tier territory.</comment>
