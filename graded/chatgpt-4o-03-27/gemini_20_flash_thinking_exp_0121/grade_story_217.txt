<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias has a distinct emotional tone and consistent motivation, but his development feels more symbolic than deeply personal; his reactions are evocative but not fully dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and thematic cohesion, but the transition from eerie phone call to emotional journey feels slightly rushed and underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic unity, but the story doesn’t quite transcend its premise or deliver a lasting emotional or intellectual impact.</comment>
