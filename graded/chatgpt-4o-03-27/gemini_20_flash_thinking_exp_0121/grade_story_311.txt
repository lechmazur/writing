<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jax’s motivation is clearly rooted in his past and his desire for freedom, and his personality—particularly his stubbornness—aligns well with his methodical approach; however, his emotional arc could benefit from more dynamic internal conflict or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical progression, with a satisfying resolution; however, the pacing is slightly uneven, and the middle leans heavily on exposition rather than dramatized action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered and symbolically rich, enhancing the mood and theme; still, more sensory detail could deepen immersion and contrast the artificial serenity with Jax’s inner turmoil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story is thematically resonant and emotionally grounded, with strong symbolism in the photograph and greenhouse, but it leans too heavily on telling rather than showing, limiting its emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and has a unique premise, some phrasing feels overly formal or abstract, and the emotional nuance occasionally veers into generic territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with a clear theme and satisfying arc, but lacks the stylistic daring or emotional depth to elevate it to top-tier literary excellence.</comment>
