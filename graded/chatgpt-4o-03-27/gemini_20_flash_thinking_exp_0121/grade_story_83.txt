<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and his motivation aligns with his traits, but his "suspiciously trusting" nature is more told than shown, and his emotional arc lacks complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and strong internal logic, but the climax is more atmospheric than plot-driven, and resolution feels more implied than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive tone, but lacks the narrative urgency or emotional resonance to elevate it to top-tier literary quality.</comment>
