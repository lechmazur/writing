<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Armitage’s obsession and desperation are vividly rendered, and his mechanical arm adds symbolic depth, but Silas remains underdeveloped, and Armitage’s motivations, while intense, verge on melodramatic without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds tension effectively and maintains internal logic, but lacks a true arc or resolution; the narrative feels like a compelling fragment rather than a complete story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original in tone and concept, with some fresh metaphors, but occasionally drifts into overwrought language and abstract phrasing that dilutes emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and atmosphere, but the lack of narrative resolution and overreliance on mood over movement limit its overall impact.</comment>
