<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and thematically rich, with strong symbolism and emotional resonance; however, the lack of narrative movement or escalation slightly dulls the impact of the otherwise powerful imagery and tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates a unique voice with fresh metaphors and a consistent, poetic tone; emotional nuance is conveyed through subtext and atmosphere rather than exposition, showing strong authorial control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative integration of elements and a lingering emotional effect; however, the lack of narrative dynamism or a turning point limits its full potential for impact.</comment>
