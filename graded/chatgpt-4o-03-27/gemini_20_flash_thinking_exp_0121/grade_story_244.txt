<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Anya’s guilt and determination are clearly conveyed, and her reserved boldness is subtly but effectively shown through her interactions and internal resolve; however, her emotional depth could be further developed for greater resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and maintains coherence within the word limit, with the pursuit of the mask driving the plot; however, the resolution feels more like a setup than a conclusion, slightly weakening the sense of completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon sign shop is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, and the contrast between the electric setting and mystical object enhances the atmosphere; the setting supports tone and theme exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong mood and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the final petal, the labyrinthine mask), though the emotional payoff could be more profound; the prose is polished and immersive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and demonstrates stylistic control, some phrases verge on overly ornate, and the historian character feels slightly generic; still, the narrative shows originality in its fusion of elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and atmospheric, with a compelling protagonist and a strong thematic throughline; it leaves a lingering sense of mystery, though it stops short of full emotional catharsis.</comment>
