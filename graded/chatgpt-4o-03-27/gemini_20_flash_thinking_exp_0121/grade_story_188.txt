<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kenji is well-drawn with a clear internal conflict and motivation; his haunted past and search for peace are consistent and compelling, though his emotional arc could deepen further with more specific memories or interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly languid, and the letter’s arrival feels a touch too convenient without stronger narrative justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details like cherry blossoms and damp earth enhancing mood and theme; the ancient castle and seasonal cues support the tone and character’s journey effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., broken pieces, seed planting) adds emotional depth; the story evokes reflection and quiet hope, though the ending could carry more narrative tension or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing leans toward the overly ornate or abstract, and the “probably improbable” motif is repeated without evolving; however, the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic intent and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, with a strong emotional undercurrent and literary ambition; minor issues in pacing and overuse of certain motifs prevent it from reaching full polish.</comment>
