<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchardist is well-developed through consistent traits—his tactile connection to nature, social distance, and quiet rebellion all align with his motivation to connect; however, his emotional arc could be deepened with more interpersonal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with the action of accessing the network serving as a satisfying climax; however, the pacing slightly lingers in atmosphere at the expense of narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cyberpunk rooftop garden is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and thematic resonance; the contrast between organic and digital is immersive and supports the character’s internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (orchard as souls, key as connection); the story evokes quiet emotion and reflection, though the lack of dialogue or interpersonal interaction limits dramatic tension.</comment>
