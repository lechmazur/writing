<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds tension effectively and ends with a moment of suspense, but lacks a clear arc or resolution; the plot feels more like a prologue than a complete narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, with creative use of elements, but it lacks narrative momentum and emotional climax to elevate it to top-tier publishability.</comment>
