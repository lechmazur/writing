<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn with a compelling internal contradiction—her "angrily peaceful" nature is reflected in her obsessive, solitary mission and her rare emotional openness; however, her voice and motivations could be deepened further through more nuanced dialogue or internal reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with the playlist discovery and new alliance providing a satisfying climax; however, the method of decoding music for plant locations strains plausibility and could use more grounding.</comment>
