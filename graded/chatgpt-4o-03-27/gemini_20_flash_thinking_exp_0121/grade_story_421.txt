<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is evocatively described, and her motivation is consistent, but her internal arc lacks depth or evolution; she remains more symbol than fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot is atmospheric but static; the coin toss sets up tension, yet the story never truly progresses beyond setup—no clear climax or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly rendered with immersive sensory detail; the contrast between the mariner’s wheel and the floral workshop adds symbolic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but it feels like a prologue rather than a complete narrative; strong atmosphere, weak progression.</comment>
