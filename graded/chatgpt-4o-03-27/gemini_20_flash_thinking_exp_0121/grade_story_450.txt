<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s characterization is strong and consistent—her linguistic ineptitude and reliance on mimicry are well-integrated into her motivations and actions, though her emotional arc could be deepened further for maximal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically unified, with a clear arc from denial to acceptance, but the prophecy twist feels slightly underdeveloped and abstract in execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imaginative and cohesive, with a compelling blend of elements and a lingering emotional tone, though not quite flawless in narrative clarity or thematic resolution.</comment>
