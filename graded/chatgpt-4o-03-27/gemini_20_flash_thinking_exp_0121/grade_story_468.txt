<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with a compelling internal contradiction—his "loudly serene" demeanor masking obsessive curiosity. His motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions align with his character, though more direct emotional stakes or transformation would deepen the arc.</comment>
