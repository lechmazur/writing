<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clearly rooted in her gambling past, and her transformation is believable; her reactions to the candle mold and the professors’ ideas deepen her arc, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot has a strong arc and thematic cohesion, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the climax leans more on atmosphere than concrete action, slightly weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and immersive, with strong sensory detail and a haunting tone that supports the story’s themes and character motivations exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., tides, candle mold), with emotional resonance and thematic depth; the ending is evocative but could benefit from a sharper resolution or twist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements are well-integrated and serve the story’s emotional and thematic goals; the narrative feels deliberate and leaves a lingering impression, though not quite transcendent.</comment>
