<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet rebellion and Silas’s transformation are well-motivated and consistent; their emotional arcs are subtle but effective, though Silas could use slightly more depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, but the pacing slightly lags in the middle and the transition to the metaphysical is abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thematically resonant; the story lingers in the mind, though a slightly tighter structure would enhance impact.</comment>
