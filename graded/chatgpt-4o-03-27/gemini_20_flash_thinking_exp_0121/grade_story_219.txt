<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply tied to his fading strength and mental acuity; his use of the origami swan reveals his contemplative nature, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc and internal logic, but the pacing is slightly languid and the resolution more atmospheric than conclusive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive, with strong sensory detail and a tone that enhances the surreal, introspective atmosphere; the island and time distortion are especially effective.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original metaphors and a unique conceptual blend avoid clich√©, though some phrasing borders on ornate; the story feels authored, not templated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic depth; the story lingers in the mind, though it leans more on mood than narrative tension.</comment>
