<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is richly drawn, with his motivations and internal contradictions (excited boredom, trauma, stoicism) coherently expressed through his actions and symbolic object; however, the lack of dialogue or external interaction slightly limits dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cyclical structure is well-executed and thematically appropriate, but the narrative arc is more emotional than event-driven, which may feel static to some readers despite its internal resolution.</comment>
