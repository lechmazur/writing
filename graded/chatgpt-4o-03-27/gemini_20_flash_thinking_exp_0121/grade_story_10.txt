<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jerrick’s internal conflict is well-developed, with his cheerlessness and pride clearly motivating his actions; his innovative mind is convincingly applied to the surreal recipes, though his emotional arc could be deepened with more specific memories or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical progression from discovery to resolution, but the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the climax—his decision to begin experimenting—feels more contemplative than narratively climactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and supports the tone and themes; the decaying spaceport and humming servers mirror Jerrick’s emotional state and the surreal recipes well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses metaphor and symbolism effectively (e.g., mutated recipes as emotional time machines), though the resolution leans more on exposition than dramatized action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>There’s originality in the fusion of sci-fi and emotional introspection, but some phrases verge on overly ornate or abstract, and a few transitions feel slightly mechanical or formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with creative integration of elements; it leaves a lingering emotional impression, though a more dynamic final image or action could elevate it further.</comment>
