<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ashwyn's motivations are clearly aligned with his personality—idealistic, reflective, and quietly revolutionary. His voice is distinct and consistent, though he could benefit from slightly more dynamic internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is compact but complete, with meaningful transformation. A few transitions (e.g., from setup to community arrival) verge on lyrical abstraction, slightly softening clarity of cause/effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotion and symbolism are impressively wrought through lush imagery and metaphor. The ending is reflective and satisfying, though some readers may find the prose nearly too ornate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While some phrases flirt with purple prose, the story avoids cliché and shows strong authorial voice and ingenuity—especially in the fusion of brewing, astronomy, and political allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong; elements feel integrated rather than inserted. The high-concept layering with poetic execution leaves a resonant aftertaste—ambitious and nearly publication-ready.</comment>
