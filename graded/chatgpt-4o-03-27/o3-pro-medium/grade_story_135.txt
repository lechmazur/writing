<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Milosz's motivations are deeply tied to his identity and history, especially through the straw and his loyalty to language; his refusal to create heat aligns with his purpose, grounding his actions in character rather than plot convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc—from threat to resolution—with rich, surreal logic; however, some transitions verge on opaque, and the carnival poster as the decoding device strains suspension slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen harbor and mechanical caravans are vividly rendered with poetic sensory detail; the setting is immersive and enhances the urgency, mystery, and emotional stakes of the tale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking use of symbolism (the straw, phonetic steam), lyrical prose, and thematic resonance with language and memory establish emotional depth; however, the climax teeters on abstract metaphor at the expense of clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally original metaphors and fresh phrasing; avoids cliché entirely; character emotion is shown through evocative detail and indirect cues, with a distinct voice and cohesive tone throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally resonant, the story binds all elements into a coherent vision with minimal excess; minor clarity sacrifices in favor of poetic abstraction prevent a perfect score.</comment>
