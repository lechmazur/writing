<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astronomer's motivation to topple the fear-idol is clear and consistent, and his internal conflict about preserving fear adds depth, though his personality remains somewhat abstract due to the poetic narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a beginning (arrival and intent), middle (veil embedded into snowflake code), and resolution (idol cracks, new emotion blooms). Cause and effect are metaphorical yet logically traceable.</comment>
