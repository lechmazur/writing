<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara is distinct and emotionally resonant; her motivations are consistent, with her defiance against replication reflecting her trauma and need for redemption. Her actions align with her values, though further character depth through dialogue could elevate it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arc—fall from integrity and redemption—is clear and coherent. The story flows logically, though the pacing in the middle slightly dips due to density of metaphor. Cause-effect is strong, with a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is textured, imaginative, and immersive, blending sci-fi with lyrical atmosphere. Descriptions are sensory-rich and thematically aligned with memory and preservation. Tone and setting are masterfully interwoven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism through the lamp and tickets is potent; the story evokes quiet reflection on commodification vs. authenticity. The prose borders on ornate but mostly supports the theme. Subtext about value and healing is compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and metaphor use. Some emotional beats are slightly overstated, briefly teetering into sentimentality. However, the imagery and voice feel human, nuanced, and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive and thoughtfully structured. All elements feel purposeful, with strong emotional weight and artistic integrity. A few minor clarity issues, but overall, it reads like a complete, memorable literary piece.</comment>
