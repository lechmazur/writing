<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Raghav's internal conflict and evolution are well-drawn, with his motivations—rooted in both professional betrayal and existential paranoia—consistently shaping his actions; his ultimate rejection of survival without conscience deepens his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc—including inciting incident, climax, and resolution—within the word limit, with a logical sequence of events driven by Raghav's objective and a meaningful turn at the climax; minor moments verge on poetic over-explication, slightly slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple setting is immersive and resonant, with rich atmospheric details (e.g., “crumbling corridors,” “moist soil”) that mirror the protagonist’s psyche and support the story’s thematic concerns of decay and rediscovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tale evokes deep reflection on authenticity, fear, and moral agency; powerful symbolism (e.g., the compass-ink blotter) and the magnetic metaphor of fate elevate the piece into layered, literary territory with strong emotional and philosophical resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in metaphorical construction and emotional subtext, with fresh, specific imagery; only minor linguistic flourishes (“fear wearing tactical boots”) risk over-stylization and could be more grounded for clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, literary piece with stylistic control, philosophical weight, and formal precision; its brevity feels intentional rather than constrained, and it leaves a lingering thematic impression on resilience and moral design.</comment>
