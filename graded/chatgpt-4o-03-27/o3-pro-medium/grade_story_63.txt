<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mari's personality as a reserved oracle is consistently reinforced by her quiet determination, attention to sonic nuance, and reverent interaction with inherited objects—the embroidered cuffs. Her motivation (preserving art) clearly shapes her secretive, almost ritualistic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive narrative arc within tight limits: setup, rising tension during her stealthy recovery of the lullaby, and a gentle emotional climax. Some transitions, while lyrical, slightly blur cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting—a laboratory of sound—is original and immersive, enriched by sensory details (aural in particular). The atmosphere beautifully supports the theme, and the world feels tangible despite the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The writing is poetic but purposeful, filled with layered metaphor and a satisfying emotional resolution. The motif of mending—across sound, generations, and emotion—echoes effectively. A strong blend of symbol and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story resists formula; metaphors are inventive ("beakers quiver," "sopranos sneeze in pitch"). Language is elegant without overindulgence. Emotion is shown through subtle physical and sonic cues rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; nearly all assigned elements are integrated seamlessly into a lyrical, meaningful whole. A few moments verge on abstraction, but the craft and originality carry it.</comment>
