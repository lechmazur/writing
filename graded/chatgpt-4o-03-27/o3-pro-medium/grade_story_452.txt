<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization as a softhearted and empathetic former champion is consistent, and her emotional response to the buckle and sacrifice aligns with her identity; however, more interiority or contrast between past and present roles could deepen her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot unfolds clearly and completes an arc within the constraint, with cause-effect logic intact; the pacing is strong, though the abstract metaphysics of the climax may slightly blur coherence for some readers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant, rich in metaphor and subtext, and the ending carries strong poetic finality; tension and transformation emerge subtly but powerfully through Mira’s sacrifice and the world’s quiet rebirth.</comment>
