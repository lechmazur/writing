<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The steward is distinct and internally consistent, with motivation ("to defy conformity") clearly informing his actions; his stoicism and quiet rebellion feel authentic and layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains unity and progression within constraints; the steward's journey is inward and symbolic, yet resolved with purpose. A touch more narrative tension would enhance it.</comment>
