<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilias and Soraya are distinct and emotionally resonant, particularly through the use of sensory metaphors; their motivations—mapping cognition and mourning a twin timeline—align well with their actions, though their interiority remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot elegantly arcs from mundane setting to surreal climax and resolution, but the transition into the palace and the fusion of cognitive mapping with grief sometimes strains coherence under the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion—aroma, atmosphere, and metaphysical architecture blend into a rich, surreal world that complements the emotional stakes and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrent and layered metaphors elevate the narrative; the palace and spice trail are powerful symbols; some dialogue and transitions slightly challenge clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original blend of scent-based cognition and interdimensional mourning; metaphors are fresh and complex, though a few phrasings approach poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coherent, lyrical, and thematically rich; the piece lingers as an emotive meditation on language, memory, and grief—though not quite flawless in pacing or narrative clarity.</comment>
