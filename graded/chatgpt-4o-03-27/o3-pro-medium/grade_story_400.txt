<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc—gathering ingredients becomes a journey of transformation, culminating in a symbolic breaking of silence; the pacing is tight and coherent, but the action-resolution transition is slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive, emotionally resonant, stylistically rich—brevity feels like choice, not limit; slightly short of perfection due to minor under-exploration of internal conflict.</comment>
