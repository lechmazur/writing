<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oren's mild curiosity and conflicted loyalty come through clearly, with his actions and emotional arc logically tied to the impossible promise and symbolic object, though his interiority could be explored more deeply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying within the word constraint, with a clear beginning, unfolding mystery, and emotionally resonant resolution, though transitions between symbolic elements risk slight abstraction overload.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is deeply immersive and atmospheric, with rich, multisensory detail that supports the lyrical tone and character’s journey—almost to the point of overshadowing clarity, but successfully avoided.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor, symbolism, and emotional subtext; the story lingers in memory and evokes reflection, though high abstraction may slightly limit accessibility for broader audiences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and voice; strong stylistic integrity with few signs of formulaic or generic phrasing, though some metaphor density leans toward poetic excess over precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and resonant; every element serves the theme and mood, though the lyrical intensity occasionally threatens clarity for readers less attuned to poetic narrative.</comment>
