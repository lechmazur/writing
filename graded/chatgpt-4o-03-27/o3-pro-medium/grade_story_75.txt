<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Caelum is distinctively rendered, with motivations (redemption, rebellion) and internal conflict rooted in his guarded, skeptically credulous nature; his refusal and poetic compromise are both character-driven and symbolic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arc is complete and coherent within tight limits, balancing rebellion, identity, and symbolism; the emotional climax (final vow) is earned though slightly dense in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, inventive, and stylistically bold with strong thematic unity; cryptic yet emotionally legible—leaves behind a lingering resonance and interpretive depth.</comment>
