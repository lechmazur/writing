<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin and Mira are both deftly drawn through action and implication; their traits—gentleness, brusque affection, and late-blooming brilliance—are tightly aligned with their choices. Motivation is poetic yet consistent, though inner conflict is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc resolves elegantly within the word count, and the magical logic holds, but some transitions (e.g., the sundial leap to the T-Rex) feel slightly underexplored; emotional causality outweighs logistical clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is deeply immersive, with striking sensory and thematic specificity; the dinosaur museum at night becomes mythic. The metaphoric resonance between prehistoric bones and cosmic rebirth is profoundly evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolism, poetic phrasing, and emotional resonance fuse beautifully—lanterns, bones, matchboxes all serve layered functions. The emotional payoff is subtle yet vast, though the ending could benefit from a sharper twist or contrast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The style is distinctive, poetic, and human in tone—largely avoiding AI tells—but occasionally veers towards purple prose. Metaphors are fresh but dense; a few feel self-consciously ornate rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and resonant; the story transcends constraints through lyrical compression. Minor overindulgence in metaphor keeps it from perfection, but emotional and conceptual unity is impressive.</comment>
