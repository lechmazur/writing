<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orphos and Viora are sharply drawn, their motivations consistent and intertwined with the theme; Viora’s perceptiveness and Orphos’s misdirection add complexity, though some emotional depth is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot arc is tight and purposeful within the word limit, with a clear setup, complication, and thematic resolution; the single-error misdirection is clever, though the pawn shop transition is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail and atmospheric control create a vivid world; every setting element—from the cracked terrarium to sunset light—directly supports mood, action, and metaphorical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and layered meaning elevate the story; the final image is both poetic and thematically satisfying, although the pacing near the climax could use a breath more clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly original conceit with fresh metaphors and specific imagery; a few phrases verge on decorative excess, but overall, the voice avoids formulaic patterns and maintains stylistic cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive, memorable, and intellectually engaging; the elements blend with impressive fluidity, and the final impression lingers, though one or two transitions could tighten.</comment>
