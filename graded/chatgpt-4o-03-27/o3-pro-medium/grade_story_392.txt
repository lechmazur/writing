<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Joriah Vex’s skepticism informs both his actions and emotional arc, with a clear evolution from doubt to reverent belief; however, deeper emotional interiority or conflict could strengthen his dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc within its constraints; categorizing misheard farewells into a thunder symphony is compelling, though transitions between scenes (capsule rides and categorizing) could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully rendered—suffused with sensory strangeness and mood; the “loud silence” and use of celestial and archival imagery create a distinctive and immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly poetic prose, layered metaphors, and a strong thematic undercurrent (farewell, memory, resonance) drive deep emotional and intellectual engagement; minor ambiguity slightly affects resolution clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Displays striking originality and voice; metaphors are fresh and specific, with distinct authorial style—though a handful of figurative turns verge on over-stylized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and balance of theme, character, and setting; leaves a resonant impression, though the density of metaphor may inhibit accessibility for some literary audiences.</comment>
