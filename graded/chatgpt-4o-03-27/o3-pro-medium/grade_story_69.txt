<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lark’s internal struggle and quiet transformation are nuanced and convincingly rendered; his motivation coheres with his actions, and his voice—though third-person—feels distinct and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is subtle yet effective, with a beginning, rising action through the journey, and resolution in the repair and personal epiphany; minor pacing stumbles near the climax prevent full marks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined with sensory detail and thematic cohesion; neon rain, library annexes, mossy magic, and theatrical alleys all reinforce mood and concept with near-perfect integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors, thematic layering, and elegant structure create potent emotional and conceptual resonance; minor absence of dialogue limits full range of direct character interaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, textured fable that lingers beyond its conclusion—with subtle emotional arcs, symbolic richness, and elegant use of assigned constraints, it feels deliberately crafted rather than box-checked.</comment>
