<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The traveler’s motivations are consistent, emotionally grounded, and delivered through action rather than exposition, lending depth to his arc; however, limited introspection during pivotal moments slightly hinders full psychological immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a clean structure with a clear arc—arrival, quest, revelation, and resolution—but certain transitions (especially between gallery exploration and the final choice) feel narratively rushed due to length constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates a unique voice and structural ingenuity, though the occasional overuse of ornamental language slightly dulls some emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A thought-provoking, emotionally resonant piece that successfully integrates its elements with grace and reflection; minor pacing friction and density of metaphor slightly reduce clarity.</comment>
