<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The salesman is vividly rendered with quirks of tone, action, and voice; his rational whimsy and underlying earnestness create a consistent and compelling personality. Motivation is subtly but clearly tied to his pursuit of interconnectedness, although more direct internal conflict would add depth.</comment>
