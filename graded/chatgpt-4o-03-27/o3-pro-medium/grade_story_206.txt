<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow's motivations are layered and evolve convincingly, her bitterness and artistry intertwined in a compelling personal arc; her pivot from vengeance to reflection is deftly handled, though slightly more interiority at key moments could enhance emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven and satisfyingly complete within the word count, with a logical cause-effect progression; the sugar-swan ploy is clever, though it stretches plausibility slightly under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is lush and immersive, with vivid sensory details that serve both mood and theme; the decayed opulence of the market and palace complements the narrative’s emotional and political tones beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elegant prose, rich symbolism (sugar as vengeance, memory, and apology), and emotional payoff at the reveal mark this as powerfully crafted; the candy art metaphor sustains thematic resonance throughout without overextension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich story that feels complete and lingers after reading; minor believability quibbles in the plot device slightly lower the score.</comment>
