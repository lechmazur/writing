<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol is sharply defined through her introspective narration, distinct diction, and poetic internal logic, though her transformation into Aster feels slightly rushed given the story's brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story forms a coherent arc—invitation, discovery, impersonation, subversion—but the leap to rewriting laws stretches believability slightly within the fixed word count.</comment>
