<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman's motivation is thematically rich and consistent, and his actions — from patrolling to knot-tying — align well with both his personality and goals, though he remains emotionally distant and somewhat archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc from mystery to revelation and returns to equilibrium, tightly woven with the symbolic riddle and climax; cause-effect links feel dreamlike yet intentional, though the narrative skirts the edge of abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and memorable, with sensory detail and poetic tone used to great effect; atmosphere and thematic resonance between sea, graveyard, and cosmic mystery are tightly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism, rhythm, and metaphor are masterfully employed, subtext runs deep, and the climax is intellectually and emotionally rewarding; tension rests more in revelation than conflict, which some may find too subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Language is lyrical without slipping into excess; metaphors are fresh and thematically precise. A few moments risk over-refinement, but overall the voice is distinctive and human, not algorithmic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nearly all elements are in service to the central theme; the narrative feels deliberate, not confined, and delivers lasting resonance. Strong evidence of thoughtful, inventive storytelling throughout.</comment>
