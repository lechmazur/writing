<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s cautious smuggling of emotion, combined with the oxymoronic “meticulously impulsive” trait, creates a compelling, layered character with a unique voice and subtle narrative arc driven by ambition and restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is strange but cohesive, with clear cause and effect, building toward a surreal yet satisfying resolution—though some transitions verge on the abstract, flirting with dream logic at times.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is vividly rendered with precise, paradoxical imagery and atmospheric strangeness; the fusion of emotion science, bureaucratic surrealism, and sensory metaphor creates a singular, immersive setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impactful and emotionally resonant, with layered metaphors (butterfly, rainfall, empathy-as-currency), strong subtext about commodified emotion, and elegant phrasing—though the symbolism occasionally crowds clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, genre-defying, and inventive; the metaphors are original and meaningful, and the tone avoids cliché entirely—clear evidence of deliberate authorial craft and stylistic vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive and stylistically confident; high craft and imaginative synthesis of elements suggest a deliberate, singular voice with literary insight and originality.</comment>
