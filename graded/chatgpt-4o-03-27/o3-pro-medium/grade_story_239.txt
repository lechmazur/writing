<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kathan is vivid and consistent as a frenetic illusionist with arcane motivations, and Delia's quiet resolve balances him well; however, their internal evolution remains a touch underdeveloped given the depth of the theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent, tightly woven arc with a compelling beginning, central action, and powerful resolution; transitions are fluid, though the climax slightly rushes emotional closure.</comment>
