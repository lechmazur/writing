<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lumira is vividly drawn, with her motivation rooted in ancestry and rebellion; her actions, like preserving outlawed traditions via smuggling, align strongly with her temperament, though an internal emotional crack might have deepened her further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot progresses with clarity and purpose, but while it achieves a satisfying arc, transitions between memory, action, and purpose occasionally blur pacing; resolution is clear but not startlingly profound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptional—rich with sensory detail and evocative metaphors linking stars, dust, and ruin; the carnival setting supports the tone and themes beautifully, enhancing both mood and stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant piece with compelling voice and purpose; complexity handled deftly, though a sharper climax might elevate it further into unforgettable territory.</comment>
