<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Adria’s motivations—rooted in nostalgia, loss, and redemption—are consistently reflected in her actions and emotional arc, though her voice remains somewhat distant and more poetic than personal at times.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative maintains a strong arc and internal logic, progressing from theft to redemption effectively; transitions are mostly fluid but a few jumps—like the sudden appearance of mercenaries—risk feeling abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive, with well-deployed sensory details and metaphoric depth; the setting and tone powerfully reinforce the themes of loss, memory, and reclamation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and poetic imagery saturated with subtext—especially around preservation and decay—though occasionally veers toward overwriting; ending is emotionally resonant and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original concept and execution, though occasional lushness in language risks purple prose; metaphors are largely fresh but come close to excess in density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story feels complete and leaves a lingering emotional impact; character, setting, and theme cohere meaningfully, showing craft and purpose throughout.</comment>
