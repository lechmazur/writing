<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The character of Moros is richly drawn with consistent motivation—to outshine the northern lights—and we see this reflected in his actions and internal contradictions. However, his emotional arc remains somewhat opaque due to abstract narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc—arrival, transformation, and resolution—with imaginative internal logic. Still, cause and effect occasionally blur in metaphor, and the pacing risks feeling ornamental over efficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The surreal, vividly rendered setting complements mood and theme exceptionally well, with sensory details tightly woven into the story’s fabric. The atmosphere is immersive and tonally cohesive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism, internal conflict, and layered metaphors are masterfully employed. The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, though the density of poetic language may obscure clarity for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Remarkably original in tone, voice, and metaphor. However, the ornate style occasionally flirts with purposeful obscurity, which may limit its accessibility and emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite its strangeness, the story achieves cohesion, thematic unity, and emotional heft. Its brevity feels intentional rather than constrained, with creative integration of all elements.</comment>
