<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic yet resonant—Orren's need to redeem broken promises and Mara’s quiet rebellion through dreams feel authentic and deeply tied to their actions; however, emotional depth could be more varied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc resolves with purpose and beauty, but the central conflict is abstract and risks emotional detachment without sharper stakes or escalation within the middle section.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric density, symbolic layering, and tonal unity create arresting literary impact; it leaves a lingering ache—but the emotional climax is muted rather than piercing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong—fresh metaphors, cohesive tone, and unique premise shine; at times, however, the lyricism leans slightly overwrought, risking self-consciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegantly composed, thematically unified, and emotionally evocative; slight abstraction keeps it from full catharsis, but it achieves introspective resonance rare at this length.</comment>
