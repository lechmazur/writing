<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emissary and Vega are sketched with poetic economy; his unease and philosophical bent contrast Vega’s pragmatic idealism, and their motivations are consistent and organically revealed, though some emotional beats remain slightly abstracted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story arc is elegant and complete, progressing through arrival, mystery, revelation, and philosophical restraint; cause and effect are subtly woven, though the climax’s philosophical weight risks overpowering the plot’s earlier simplicity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is beautifully imagined—original, atmospheric, and richly sensory; it enhances tone and theme while metaphorically supporting the characters’ internal and external quests.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A quietly profound narrative marked by resonant symbolism, lyrical phrasing, and philosophical depth; its emotional undercurrent surfaces through inference and image, not exposition, though some metaphors veer toward overextension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is highly original, with fresh metaphor and inventive imagery; some symbolic gestures risk ambiguity or poetic indulgence, but overall the vision feels unique, human, and stylistically confident.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This is a cohesive, thematically rich work that balances mystery, tone, and character; its restraint is its strength, offering a quietly luminous ending that rewards reflection without insisting upon itself.</comment>
