<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara is vividly realized: her cartographic mindset shapes her decisions and emotional arc. Her internal motivation—finding place before her brother fades—is clear, though the brother remains underdeveloped as a character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is imaginative and flows with dreamlike logic, but some transitions verge on the surreal; clarity occasionally suffers under lyrical abstraction, especially in the hospital-to-blacksmith forge shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The futuristic hospital is lushly rendered with haunting, immersive detail; the balance of sterile setting and mythic imagery establishes strong atmosphere integral to theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance, metaphorical density, and symbolic layering are exceptional, though the mythic forge risks bordering on poetic indulgence; the final image is strikingly effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original with fresh metaphor (balloon, dragonfly, forge), though a few turns ("furnace glowing like subterranean sunrise") feel a touch ornate. Overall avoids clichés and demonstrates strong control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An ambitious, lyrical, and thematically resonant flash piece that juggles concept and emotion with skill. Some surreal transitions slightly obscure narrative clarity, but the vision is compelling and cohesive.</comment>
