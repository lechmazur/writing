<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Malachai is a vivid, internally conflicted character whose motivations—atonement, revision of fate—are expressed clearly through action and symbolic interaction with the abacus; minor ambiguity remains in emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is gracefully complete within tight constraints—beginning in confusion, culminating in a transformative but subtle metaphysical act; transitions are fluid, though the climax risks over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The surreal orchard is immersive and thematically rich, with consistently potent sensory imagery; atmosphere and setting reinforce character and tone with rare cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (abacus, snow, altar) is layered and evocative; subtext around faith, fate, and self-reckoning emerges organically, though emotional stakes could be felt more acutely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story shows intentional voice and nuanced metaphor, with mostly original phrasing; a few familiar beats (journey, altar scene) slightly impede total freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements are meaningfully integrated, and the story leaves a resonant impression; structure and tone elevate it beyond a prompt-driven piece.</comment>
