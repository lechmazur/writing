<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hector’s earnest naivety and unlucky disposition drive the story effectively; his misguided interpretation of signs is consistent and poignant, though he remains a bit archetypal and underdeveloped emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc within tight constraints, with a clear trajectory from ominous setup to poetic resolution; a few symbolic transitions slightly strain coherence, but the internal logic largely holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is atmospherically rich and immersive—laden with eerie, tactile detail and deeply tied to the themes; the sensory and tonal unity is exceptional in evoking mystery and decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brilliant imagery and thematic layering—the metaphors of rust/gold and maps of thought resonate; while dialogue is absent, the story shows rather than tells with style and rhythm, though ending could be more revelatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché with inventive metaphor and tone, though moments of over-ornamentation border on purple prose; originality shines in execution, though occasional figurative density hinders clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, thematically resonant, and emotionally evocative—despite some opacity in character nuance, it lingers with philosophical weight and stylistic confidence.</comment>
