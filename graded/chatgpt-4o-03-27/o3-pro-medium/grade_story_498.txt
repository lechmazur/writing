<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marlo’s fear and “fragile ferocity” are clearly rendered, and his evolution from hesitant kingpin to symbol of hope is convincing; Felix’s turn is slightly less developed but emotionally plausible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story arc is tightly structured with setup, escalation, and resolution; the cause-effect relationships are logical and effective within the limited word count, though the sudden militia appearance strains credulity slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly layered with sensory and symbolic detail that reinforces both tone and theme—especially the icy wind, seed pods, and pearl-misted dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism is skillfully woven (seed pods, frost, smoke as memory); the ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though some metaphors verge on overwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh combinations and emotional nuance elevate the piece, avoiding cliché; some phrasing tiptoes near purple prose but generally retains elegance and control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deeply resonant, thematically unified, and stylistically confident—brief length feels intentional, not limiting; story lingers beyond the final sentence.</comment>
