<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The traveler’s inner conflict is rendered with subtle, consistent psychological nuance, and his motivations–to escape internal torment–are embodied well through symbolic actions and setting interaction. However, the impersonality of the narration slightly mutes emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story maintains a tight internal logic and satisfying arc within the word constraint. The resolution is metaphorical yet clear, and each beat flows into the next with purpose. A slightly diffuse middle prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s greatest strength: vivid, immersive, and metaphorically resonant. The house of mirrors, stained glass, and coastal wind all enrich tone and emotional texture with sensory precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and layered metaphor support a meditative emotional arc. The final self-directed love feels earned. However, some imagery verges on overwrought, risking over-saturation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in voice, metaphor, and execution. No reliance on cliché; language is largely fresh and crafted. There are moments, however, where phrasing edges toward the poetically indulgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements work in harmony to deliver a profound, stylistically distinctive story. Despite abstract tendencies, it maintains coherence and emotional force throughout, leaving a lingering impression of transformation.</comment>
