<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vireo is deeply motivated by his death wish, and this desire shapes all his decisions; his transformation at the climax is earned and emotionally resonant, though a touch more nuance in his inner conflict could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and powerful, with a strong beginning, rising action, and culminating resolution; some transitions (like the society’s sudden emergence) feel slightly rushed under the word count pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Consistently cohesive, evocative, and inventive within tight constraints; the story lingers after reading, offering both emotional resonance and intellectual intrigue through its layered narrative design.</comment>
