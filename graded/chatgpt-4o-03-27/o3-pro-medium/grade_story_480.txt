<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's blend of detached irony and obsessive curiosity creates a distinct voice, and their motivations—both performative and existential—drive the plot credibly; only the exorcist's internal depth remains elusive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is surreal but coherent, with a clear beginning, mysterious quest, confrontation, and transformation; however, some transitions—like the club’s rules or the function of the mess hall—could be clarified for stronger connective logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid speculative imagery—melted vinyl stalactites, paper-bird tweets, neon stalagmites—creates a haunting, immersive world that extends the metaphor of digital ghosts; atmosphere and sensory detail powerfully reinforce the story’s themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s layered metaphor about memory, media, and identity is executed with poetic precision and stylistic daring; the voice is distinctive, tension builds subtly, and the final image lingers with thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly imaginative and stylistically singular, the story subverts digital culture tropes with fresh symbolism and poetic invention; a few moments skirt purple prose, but overall coherent and emotionally nuanced—far from formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves unity across surreal imagery, character motive, and emotional tone, integrating its many demanded elements with surprising elegance; its brevity feels intentional, not restrictive, and it leaves a haunting philosophical aftertaste.</comment>
