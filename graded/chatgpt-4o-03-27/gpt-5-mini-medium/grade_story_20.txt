<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character is vividly drawn, with a unique contradiction ("anxiously calm") that is consistently expressed through his behavior and internal logic; motivations are coherent but lightly obscured behind poetic prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot moves with a subtle arc and maintains thematic cohesiveness, though the resolution leans more toward tonal completion than narrative closure; pacing is deliberate but borders on languid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly original voice and imagery distinguish the piece, though occasional overreach into abstraction and ornate phrasing slightly dulls its authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A strong, cohesive meditation on witness, agency, and memory, with all elements supporting a deeply literary aim; minor clarity compromises keep it from being flawless.</comment>
