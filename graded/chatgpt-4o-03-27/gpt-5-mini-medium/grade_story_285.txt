<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Conceptual handling is fresh and layered, metaphor-rich without excess; metaphors and setting blend seamlessly, and language is poetic but controlled, avoiding cliché or machine-patterned phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story blends its components with notable elegance and resonance, with lingering philosophical questions; minor abstraction in voice weakens immediacy slightly.</comment>
