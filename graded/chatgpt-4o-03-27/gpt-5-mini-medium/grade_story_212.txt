<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The farmer’s motivations—defined by constraint, inheritance, and the pursuit of choice—are deeply embedded in his actions and the symbolic use of cards and seeds; his voice is poetic and consistent, though not emotionally layered beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc emerges through mood more than plot; while gestures toward change and resolution are present, the story leans on abstraction and lacks a clearly defined turning point or climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strikingly immersive, with the ethereal plains acting as metaphor and stage; sensory descriptions are lyrical, and the world coheres around tone and theme with rare literary finesse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story pulses with metaphor and philosophical undercurrent; the card-shuffling and seed-breeding merge into powerful imagery of control, fate, and rebellion, though at times the density suppresses emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Uncommonly inventive use of metaphor, structure, and tone; the prose resists formula and shows unique authorial style, though the complexity skirts the edge of self-parody at moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A bold and contemplative piece with clear thematic layering and emotional ambition, though its abstraction and lack of conventional plot arc may alienate some readers.</comment>
