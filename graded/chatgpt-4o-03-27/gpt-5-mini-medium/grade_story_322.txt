<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character is distinctive, with consistent motivation and a compelling voice; his actions align well with his rationally whimsical trait, though secondary character interaction could deepen the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The arc is impressionistic rather than conventionally structured, with strong thematic cohesion but limited narrative propulsion; the resolution feels thoughtful but not earned through plot logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is highly evocative—surreal yet grounded; atmosphere and sensory details (sound, tone, scent) create a vivid, immersive environment that directly enhances the protagonist’s goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, original framing, and idiosyncratic rhythms avoid formula; some repetition in mood and syntax slightly hampers variety, but overall execution is surprising and elegant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A rich and unified narrative that balances abstraction with tangible imagery; the brevity enhances the poetic quality, though it limits full dramatic payoff.</comment>
