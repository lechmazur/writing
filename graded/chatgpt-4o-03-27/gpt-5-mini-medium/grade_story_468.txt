<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mortician is vividly characterized through poetic contradiction—his curiosity, politeness, and methodical mimicry evoke a layered personality consistent throughout, though he borders on a symbol rather than a psychologically deep individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves with dream logic—lyrical but abstract. While the structure has flow and a sense of resolution, the action-progression feels more thematic than causal, softening plot coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is powerfully immersive—mangroves, golden embers, and spirits are evoked with synesthetic precision. Sensory detail is richly used to build setting and tone in seamless harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s language is intensely lyrical and metaphor-rich, creating strong emotional undertones and a haunting sense of beauty and decay. Subtext around memory, grief, and moral ambiguity is deftly implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stylistic choices are often dazzling, but occasionally verge on overwritten. Most metaphors are arrestingly original, though a few risk opacity or indulgence, potentially alienating less patient readers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A highly original, emotionally resonant story with cohesive use of elements and a lingering mood. Its lack of conventional structure limits broader accessibility but it deeply rewards literary attention.</comment>
