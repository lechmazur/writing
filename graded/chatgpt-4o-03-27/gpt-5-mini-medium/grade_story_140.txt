<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s role as a “tortured protector” is deeply embedded in his actions and inner conflict. His emotional attachment and guilt are evident in his interaction with the doll and memory of the planetarium moment. His voice is clear, reflective, and sincere.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arc is subtle but discernible: a movement from waiting to active release. The pacing is deliberate, though the surrealist tone slightly obscures cause-effect clarity at moments. Still, the story resolves emotionally and thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive—decaying circus, morning light, velvet textures, and olfactory detail build a palpable atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist’s liminal inner state. Great use of sensory layering supports the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is resonant and lyrical, with standout metaphors (e.g., “costumes sagging like exhausted planets”). It uses subtext, memory, and symbolism elegantly. The central conflict—protection vs. curiosity—is well explored with literary craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors and precise, evocative language elevate the voice. Minor moments verge on overwriting, but the poetic style generally enhances rather than obscures. Emotion is shown with nuance and detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally thoughtful piece with clear integration of elements into a resonant theme. The brevity feels intentional, and the closing image lingers meaningfully. Minor clarity issues prevent a perfect score.</comment>
