<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The worldbuilding is immersive and vivid, with specific sensory cues and rich symbolic layering between setting, object, and atmosphere that elevate the tone and deepen the mythos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is deeply resonant, metaphor-laced, and layered with subtext, offering thematic richness and emotional depth rarely seen in such compressed form; its poetic style enhances meaning rather than obscures it.</comment>
