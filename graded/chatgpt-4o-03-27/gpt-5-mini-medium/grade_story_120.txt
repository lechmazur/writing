<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator has a coherent and distinct internal logic; their motivations are poetic but grounded in ritualized compassion and burnout. The voice is powerfully singular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Although nonlinear due to the time-loop concept, the narrative arc is emotionally progressingâ€”loop 13 signals a pivot, and the lure-ritual provides a subtle but satisfying emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is haunting and immersive; sensory motifs like the raindrop and the "tunnel cough" deepen the surreal hospital-world without over-explaining the mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative, fresh metaphors and symbolism throughout; themes of grief, ritual, and repetition are deeply felt without being heavy-handed. Hints at larger emotional stakes without explicit exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious yet restrained. Repetition is purposeful, metaphor is layered, and the themes develop subtly. Occasionally borders on florid, but rarely loses emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story achieves both lyricism and narrative coherence. It feels like a distilled meditation rather than a summary, successfully combining structure and voice in a tight form.</comment>
