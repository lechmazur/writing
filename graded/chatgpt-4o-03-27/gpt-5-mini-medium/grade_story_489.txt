<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The unseen observer is richly characterized through poetic description and a consistent inner motivation—to preserve ritual. The connection between attribute, motive, and action is tight, though some opacity remains around their full emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressionistic but coherent: a ritualistic action triggers a metaphysical shift. Cause and effect align symbolically rather than logically, which works thematically but may challenge narrative clarity for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse atmosphere is exceptionally vivid—fog, floorboards, whale song—all working in harmony with the tone and character’s goal. Sensory and emotional immersion are deeply effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storytelling craft is remarkably high: metaphor, rhythm, and imagery converge to evoke reverence and nostalgia. The ending resonates emotionally and intellectually, though some may find it elliptical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking originality elevates familiar tropes. The use of a plastic whistle against cosmic elements is absurd yet poignant. Language is lyrical but mostly avoids indulgence. Some phrases veer toward the ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically layered. The brevity enhances rather than limits, though the abstracted style may alienate some readers; overall, highly effective.</comment>
