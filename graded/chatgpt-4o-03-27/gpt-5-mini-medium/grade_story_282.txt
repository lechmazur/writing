<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jory is vividly drawn with consistent traits—brash, consciously wild, nostalgic—and his motivations (preserving traditional games, creating ritual) align with his actions, though more interpersonal conflict or evolution would deepen complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and specific imagery avoid cliché; the tone and style are distinctive though some flourishes—particularly around the shell—push toward ornate excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant with inventive use of constraints; a few moments veer into abstraction, but overall the piece lingers compellingly.</comment>
