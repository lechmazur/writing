<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The protagonist has a distinct psychology and consistency—his morally ambiguous charm and obsession with obscure treasures are well-aligned—but slightly opaque motivations and minimal direct interaction slightly lessen emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story maintains strong internal logic, with a lyrical, coherent arc from mundane shopping to mystical discovery; though lacking a climactic shift, the structure elegantly supports thematic drift and subtle progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly constructed through sensory detail and tone; the grocery aisles, the fogged tower, and the worn packets create a vivid, immersive world that elevates both plot and theme.</comment>
