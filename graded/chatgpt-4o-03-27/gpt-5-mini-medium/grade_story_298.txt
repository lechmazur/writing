His emotional and intellectual choices are distinct, nuanced, and thematically purposeful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story builds a cohesive arc from mystery to emotional revelation, anchored by the actor’s forensic method. There’s a ghostlike logic guiding it, though some transitions are poetic rather than narratively crisp, slightly softening the resolution's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich, immersive, and symbolically potent. Sensory details—sunlight through debris, metallic corridors, frayed robes—create not only vivid imagery but emotional texture that enhances character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant, stylistically elegant, and thematically layered. Symbolism is deftly handled (e.g., costumes hiding loss, mirror as false mourning window), and the fusion of performance, grief, and justice is deeply affecting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The language is poetic yet precise, with fresh metaphors and inventive imagery.
