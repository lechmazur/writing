<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The soothsayer's traits—pragmatism, humility, ambition—are deeply integrated into his actions and methods; his motivations are clear and his transformation arc is subtly rendered, though slight tonal detachment limits full emotional immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a beginning (establishment of role), middle (use of method), and resolution (child’s plea and outcome), though some transitions are abstract enough to risk narrative opacity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is vividly imagined; rich with sensory metaphor and layered atmosphere—setting, method, and tone merge into a cohesive, immersive environment that feels wholly original and alive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lyrical prose amplifies the thematic ambition—pattern vs. mystery, method vs. magic—while symbolism (hammer, song, sapling) deepens meaning; ending feels earned, though slightly more emotional resonance would elevate it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, original phrasing, and a confidently strange aesthetic avoid formulaic traps; emotional subtlety and thematic nuance show creative intentionality rather than mechanical construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A finely woven narrative where ideas, imagery, and theme mutually reinforce; slightly abstracted emotional tone prevents full catharsis, but the story lingers with quiet power and rare conceptual cohesion.</comment>
