<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist is uniquely rendered, with motivations and traits—particularly his "elegantly clumsy" empathy—consistently reflected in his actions and rituals; his ghost-sensing intersects meaningfully with his work, though there's minor opacity around how he came to this worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While the narrative flows more thematically than causally, the story achieves a meditative completeness; the arc of learning to release is subtly resolved, though a traditional structural climax is absent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and richly sensory—sunlight, gypsum, humming dehumidifiers, and fine-grain sand all conjure a melancholy, tactile world that amplifies the themes of memory and impermanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic language, strong metaphors, and subtle symbolic layering create emotional resonance and thematic depth; the motif of release is handled with sophistication, though narrative tension is intentionally low-key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An original premise with fresh metaphors and emotional nuance; while some phrasings border on ornate, overall the prose avoids cliché and offers distinctive imagery and voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and thematically unified, the story lingers emotionally; the lunch-break timing and mundane setting elevate rather than constrain the narrative, affirming intentional, artful brevity.</comment>
