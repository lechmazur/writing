<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation is consistent, subtle, and layered; his persona as a conscientious objector transforms into a quietly strategic force, blending hospitality with protection and subversion. His voice is distinctive and his actions align with his principles, revealing depth without overt exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is more thematic tapestry than linear arc; while rich in atmosphere and character-driven motifs, it lacks a traditional resolution or sharp structural pivot. The progression is impressionistic but coherent, rewarding attentive reading yet slightly diffuse in destination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and sensorially rich.

The tone and world are deeply interwoven, creating a powerful sense of place and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphor enrich the narrative, with subtext surfacing through layered actions and repeated symbols (flags, nails, maps). The story evokes a haunting, lingering impact—less from overt conflict than from emotional and thematic resonance. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clichés and embraces fresh combinations of tone, detail, and metaphor.
