<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is elegantly complex; the conjurer’s “humble arrogance” is shown through small, deliberate acts, and motivations emerge subtly through interactions and routines. Slight ambiguity around the archivist’s arc prevents perfect clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc despite lyrical density, building to a quiet climax; however, pacing risks sluggishness in early sections, and resolution feels more symbolic than narratively complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is powerfully evoked through atmospheric sensory detail and metaphor; the interplay of lighthouse, library, and temporal displacement creates an immersive and haunting world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stylistic craft is exceptional—rich metaphor, clear theme of ephemeral reclamation, and emotional resonance; tension is low-stakes but handled with precision and restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Extremely original metaphors and vivid prose with minimal cliché; occasional risk of overwrought phrasing, but overall language is specific and fresh with strong narrative intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A nuanced, cohesive story with depth beyond its length; its themes and mood linger, and every assigned element is woven into a final tableau that feels earned and lyrical.</comment>
