<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is mesmerizing, marked by lush sensory detail and a haunting, immersive setting wholly integrated with tone and action; the world feels lived-in and mythic without losing specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically rich, the story masterfully uses metaphor and repetition to craft an elegy for imperfection and transformation, though minor overuse of abstract phrasing slightly dulls edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive and lyrical, the story integrates its elements with surprising harmony and depth, leaving a potent thematic residue, though it flirts with opacity in moments needing sharper narrative torque.</comment>
