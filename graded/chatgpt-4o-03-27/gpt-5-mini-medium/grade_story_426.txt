<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivations are deeply tied to memory, loss, and cultural preservation, and his actions consistently reflect this. The “angrily peaceful” demeanor is subtly but effectively portrayed through ritual and resistance, showing layered emotion and singular focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is non-linear but cohesive, with strong emotional payoff and thematic closure. There is a slight risk of obliqueness due to highly lyrical structure, but the resolution with the developer offers needed narrative punctuation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with multisensory details (camphor, rust, wintergreen, ghost train) that evoke mood and theme. The haunted park and ghost train intertwine elegantly with memory, folklore, and marginalization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly evocative and symbolic storytelling—especially the teapot as a reliquary—is memorable and emotionally resonant. The use of sensory and symbolic storytelling is superb, though a clearer central conflict could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and authentic voice throughout. The hacking-playlists-as-apothecary angle is imaginative and fresh. A few poetic phrases tread close to purple, but overall language remains purposeful and inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive, thematically rich, and emotionally memorable. The fusion of folklore, technology, grief, and resistance creates an original piece that lingers. Minor clarity issues in structure prevent a perfect score.</comment>
