<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's personality—a strange balance of ritualistic duty and dispassionate competence—is vividly imagined and consistently rendered, with strong symbolic and emotional ties to his past oath and the fan; his motivations feel archetypal yet specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While non-linear and atmospheric, the progression is coherent; the scarecrow's defense of the fossil site through both physical and virtual means provides a fragmented but effective arc of purpose and resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fossilized giant setting is both richly sensory and metaphorically potent; tone and atmosphere are tightly interwoven into the character’s worldview, enhancing thematic cohesion and emotional texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and subtext, particularly the interplay between memory, mourning, and data; the language is poetic yet sharp, evoking a haunting meditation on purpose and decay without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Extremely original in concept and execution, with fresh figurative language and philosophical undertones; some minor repetition in phrasing slightly hinders the otherwise vivid uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A thematically rich, atmospherically dense piece that lingers well beyond its length; form and voice are in harmony, though slightly abstract for broader accessibility.</comment>
