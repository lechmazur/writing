<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's obsessive motivation, internal contradictions, and symbolic actions create a vivid, credible portrait, though his emotional arc could be more developed for full resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and complete within the constraints, with clear cause-effect links; resolution is thematic rather than plot-based, which suits the story’s tone—though risks abstract drift near the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and symbolically rich, with layered sensory details and setting that reinforce the character’s psyche and mission; the dust alone is practically a character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, effective metaphor, and subtextual tension elevate the story’s emotional and thematic impact, though a hint more dialogue or internal thought might enhance immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original concept and execution; metaphors are fresh, layered, and precise, with minimal cliché or generic phrasing; the symbolic use of erasure is particularly inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Extremely cohesive and richly crafted; all elements serve the story rather than dominate it, and it feels deliberately constructed rather than constrained by format.</comment>
