<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Min's characterization is vivid and idiosyncratic, with her "reliably unreliable" temperament informing her rituals and choices; however, her motivation to restore traditional practices is more implied than deeply explored or challenged, limiting full emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative loops beautifully rather than following a traditional arc, which supports the theme but slightly undermines clarity of plot progression; some readers may find the structure more poetic than purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and gorgeously textured—lamps, glue, hum of printers—all work in chorus to evoke a liminal atmosphere that enhances the story's ritualistic tone and temporal fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative language, layered metaphors, and emotional subtext make the story linger; conflict is quiet but real, and Min's repetition and anxiety lend understated pathos and meaning to her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through in metaphorical density and surreal logic, though some turns feel slightly overwritten or meandering; overall, the piece avoids cliché and demonstrates a distinct literary voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story exhibits cohesion, style, and vision, weaving its assigned elements into a rich tapestry that rewards re-reading, even if traditional narrative anchors are softened in favor of mood and meaning.</comment>
