<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is distinct, and their motivations—though poetic—are internally consistent, shaped by intellect, aesthetic sensibility, and a quiet compulsion for meaning-making in fragility. Still, deeper emotional complexity could strengthen characterization.</comment>
