<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The heir's internal arc from confused observer to mischievous inheritor is well-developed and emotionally coherent; his hunger and transformation feel authentic, though his motivations emerge more through symbolism than concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story follows a subtle yet satisfying arc, with the act of scraping murals anchoring progression; some transitions feel slightly lyrical to the point of abstraction, which could soften narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric; the magnetic mountain, flickering projector, and dust-laced movie house are richly rendered and support the character’s inner journey beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly evocative with inventive metaphors, subtext, and emotional weight; the spoon, murals, and projector are loaded with layered symbolism, though some imagery teeters close to excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imaginative and fresh in language and concept; mostly avoids cliché but flirts occasionally with overly ornate phrasing that could suggest stylized rather than lived emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong unity of elements, atmosphere, and theme creates a resonant, memorable whole; minor abstractions slightly hinder clarity but not impact.</comment>
