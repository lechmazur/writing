<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character is vivid, psychologically nuanced, and her motivation is clearly entangled with her traits; the linguistic ineptness is used symbolically and practically, although emotional depth could be pushed further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story arc is subtle but complete, with a clear emotional and thematic resolution; pacing is elegant, but some conceptual elements (the family photo ritual, holograms) strain coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric immersion is exceptional; sensory details and tone are evocative and purposeful, with setting and concept deeply intertwined to reinforce mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original and emotionally textured; while some stylistic choices verge on overwrought, the voice feels distinctively human and avoids formulaic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Complex, thoughtful, and conceptually rich; all elements are meaningfully used, and the story lingers with thematic clarity and emotional weight.</comment>
