<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The character is vividly drawn and her motivation—though abstract—remains consistent with her actions and mental landscape; however, her “ingenious cluelessness” feels more stylized than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc resolves neatly and imaginatively within the word limit, but relies heavily on surreal logic, which may compromise clarity at times; cause-effect is dreamlike but purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with consistent sensory detail and tone; the abandoned roller coaster and weather become integral to the narrative’s emotional texture and symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong subtext, arresting metaphor, and layered symbolism elevate this beyond surface narrative; emotionally resonant and stylistically distinctive, though some phrases verge on the overwritten.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original in execution and style, though occasional flourishes stray toward purple prose; avoids clichés and maintains an almost hallucinatory consistency of tone and metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesively built, and every element works in synergy; minor lapses into obliqueness affect clarity, but the creative ambition and emotional payoff are admirable and memorable.</comment>
