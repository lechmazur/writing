<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character’s internal conflict is clear and emotionally resonant, with his motivations—both promise-bound and yearning for joy—effectively driving his actions.

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and emotionally satisfying, progressing from duty to liberation through the ritual of decoding the postcards; however, some temporal and metaphysical elements feel stylized more than structured, slightly blurring cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>World-building is evocative and immersive, with strong symbolic atmosphere—the mechanical bird sanctuary and folded spacetime create a rich, surreal stage that supports character and tone beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stunning use of metaphor, strong command of language, and layered emotional resonance. The ending is poetic and earned. Literary devices enrich rather than overwhelm. The central paradox is handled with finesse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in imagery and concept, with only occasional slips toward ornamental phrasing. The metaphors feel fresh. Emotional nuance is generally well-rendered through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally impactful. The story blends surrealism and character arc in a distinctive style. Resonant themes linger, though the density of metaphor slightly risks clarity in spots.</comment>
