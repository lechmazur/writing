<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is rendered with nuanced contradiction—his ironically earnest demeanor and secret sincerity feel authentic and guide his actions meaningfully; his motivation is original though slightly abstracted at points.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot’s emotional arc is clear and complete within the word count, though the meeting and message via paper plane edges toward whimsy; causality holds but leans on poetic license over realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory detail (wax, lemon, static) enhancing tone and theme seamlessly; world is rich without exposition overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elegant prose and metaphor enrich the emotional core; story shows thematic depth and a strong sense of subtext through atmospheric cues and symbolic gestures—especially in the plane’s messages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in tone and metaphor; avoids AI hallmarks—voice is consistent, metaphors inventive and specific, emotional nuance is shown, not told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Remarkably cohesive and stylistically confident; every element feels deliberate rather than arbitrary, with lingering emotional resonance—but minor ambiguity in some transitions tempers perfection.</comment>
