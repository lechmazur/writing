<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character of the ghostly caretaker is richly drawn with consistent motivation, a distinct voice, and symbolic action tied closely to their goal of communication and fate-weaving; slight vagueness in emotional interiority limits full resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative flows elegantly in its episodic structure; though intentionally nonlinear, it achieves structural coherence and a sense of gentle progression, with only minor tension sacrificed for mood and tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully evocative—lush with sensory detail and atmosphere; the frozen orchard with geothermal breath feels both surreal and fully realized, supporting tone, motivation, and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The writing style is lyrical and deliberate; metaphors and images are inventive, and the story’s impact lingers; lack of overt plot conflict is replaced by thematic complexity and poetic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nearly all metaphors are fresh and specific, with a wholly original concept and vivid language that avoids formula; a few slightly overwritten phrases tread close to excess, but style remains controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive piece with every element in service of a singular tone and vision; the brevity feels like a deliberate aesthetic constraint rather than a limitation—a full world revealed in a breath.</comment>
