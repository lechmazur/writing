<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astronomer’s motivations are clear, complex, and interwoven with the veil and his desire to unmake fear. His reverence, methodical curiosity, and contradiction between awe and action form a distinct psychological portrait, though he lacks emotional range or transformation beyond his established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot has a poetic arc—discovery, contemplation, confrontation—but sacrifices clarity and emotional escalation for metaphor. Cause and effect are mostly internalized and thematic, which works structurally but may hinder momentum for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly immersive and consistent; the fusion of inorganic (ice, light) and organic (orchard, grief) elements beautifully underscores the emotional terrain. Sensory cues are specific and support tone, with a compelling internal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story provokes deep reflection on fear, belief, and memory. Symbolism is layered but not overwrought, and metaphors are fresh and thematically aligned. Emotional resonance is subtle yet strong. The ending is ambiguous but thematically appropriate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While phrases occasionally verge on overwritten, they largely avoid generic tropes. Imagery is mostly precise and stylistically unique. Some metaphor density may obscure emotional immediacy, but overall originality and cohesion are strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story balances its elements elegantly, with clear intentionality. Though abstract, it avoids pretension. The brevity supports its poetic, meditative pace rather than limiting it. A lingering thematic weight remains despite minimal plot.</comment>
