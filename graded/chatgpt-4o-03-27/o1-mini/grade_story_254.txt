<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gregory’s internal conflict is well-drawn, and his motivation—though abstract—is consistent; however, his transformation feels slightly rushed and lacks deeper emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven, and the central action (bottling a star’s breath) remains metaphorical, weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues that mirror Gregory’s emotional state, though the wilderness could be more integrated into the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism and introspection are effective, and the ending is emotionally resonant, but the story leans heavily on telling rather than showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on overwrought; the tone is mostly consistent, though the language occasionally slips into vague abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, but lacks the narrative tension or stylistic precision required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
