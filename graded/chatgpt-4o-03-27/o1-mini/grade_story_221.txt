<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to break from tradition is clear and emotionally grounded, but her voice lacks distinctiveness and the ghost whisperer trait is underutilized in shaping her actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the plot progression is more atmospheric than driven, with the action of "arousing" spirits feeling symbolic rather than narratively catalytic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and mood-rich, with strong sensory detail and tone alignment, though the connection between the carnival and Miraâ€™s ghost-whispering past could be more integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively, especially with the amber, but lacks a strong central conflict or tension to elevate its impact beyond mood and theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on generic or overly poetic; the writing occasionally leans into formulaic phrasing and lacks the unpredictability of truly original voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, but the integration of all assigned elements feels uneven, with some components feeling ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
