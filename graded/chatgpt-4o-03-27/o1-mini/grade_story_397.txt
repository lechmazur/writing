<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ethan’s jaded persona and motivation to understand his past are clear and consistent, but his emotional arc feels slightly underdeveloped given the weight of his trauma and transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution, though the method of using doodles to globalize the investigation strains plausibility slightly and could use more grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal lab setting is evocative and symbolically rich, enhancing the mood and reflecting Ethan’s fractured psyche; sensory detail is strong but could be more varied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly with the crystals and scalpel, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of deeper conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels overly polished or abstract, and the “doodles on receipts” method borders on quirky-for-quirky’s-sake, though the overall concept is original and avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a clear emotional throughline, but lacks the narrative risk or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
