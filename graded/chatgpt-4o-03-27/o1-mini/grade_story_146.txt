<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miranda’s motivations are generally clear and consistent, but her emotional depth and internal conflict are underdeveloped; her “peaceful anger” is stated rather than shown, and her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical progression, but transitions between events feel overly smooth and lack tension; the resolution is satisfying but predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The extinct language archive and crypt are evocative, but sensory detail is sparse and the atmosphere, while consistent, lacks immersive specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and integrates its elements reasonably well, but lacks the stylistic precision and emotional complexity expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
