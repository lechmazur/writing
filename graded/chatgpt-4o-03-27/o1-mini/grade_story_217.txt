<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Margot’s emotional arc is present but underdeveloped; her motivations are hinted at rather than deeply explored, and her "underestimated rebel" identity lacks concrete demonstration through action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing feels overly smooth and lacks tension; the call as a turning point is effective but underutilized in terms of stakes or conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is evocatively rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere that supports the tone and character’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>There is emotional resonance and thematic cohesion, but the prose occasionally leans into abstraction and repetition, weakening the impact of otherwise strong imagery and symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some metaphors and phrasing feel generic or overly poetic; while the story avoids clichés, it lacks the freshness or surprise that would elevate it beyond competent execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but it plays safe with structure and lacks the narrative risk or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
