<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The character's internal conflict is clear and consistent, but his emotional arc lacks specificity and depth; his motivations are abstractly conveyed rather than grounded in concrete actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has a thematic arc, but lacks a clear narrative structureâ€”no inciting incident or climax; the resolution feels more like a philosophical reflection than a plot-driven conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The beehive setting is imaginative and metaphorically rich, but sensory details are vague and repetitive, limiting immersion; the atmosphere supports the theme but lacks tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the ruler), but emotional impact is dulled by abstract language and lack of concrete stakes; the prose leans toward telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others feel overwritten or generic; the tone is consistent but occasionally veers into purple prose, and emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its abstract style and lack of narrative tension limit its memorability and emotional resonance; strong concept, weaker execution.</comment>
