<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jonah’s motivations are clear and evolve meaningfully, but his emotional arc lacks some depth and specificity; the “eagerly unwilling” trait is underexplored and feels more like a label than a lived contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution, though the pacing is slightly uneven and the transition between storm chasing and carousel restoration feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The contrast between desert and alpine monastery is evocative and supports the theme well; sensory detail is strong, though the setting could be more deeply integrated into the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (carousel, tapestry, storm), with a resonant emotional payoff; however, some moments verge on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept and metaphor, but some phrasing feels slightly generic or overly polished, and the emotional nuance could be more textured to avoid sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Well-crafted and thematically cohesive, with a clear emotional arc and satisfying conclusion; minor issues with transitions and depth of character voice prevent a higher score.</comment>
