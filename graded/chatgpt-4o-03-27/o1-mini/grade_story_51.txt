<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus has a clear arc and motivation, but his transformation feels overly smooth and lacks the complexity or tension expected from a reformed criminal; his voice is somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the plot progression is predictable and the method (museum meetings) feels underdeveloped and too convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but its execution is too safe and lacks the stylistic daring or emotional depth required for elite publication.</comment>
