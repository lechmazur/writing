<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zane’s motivation is consistent and thematically aligned, but his emotional detachment limits depth and growth; his personality is more described than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying resolution, but the action of “informing” through call logs feels abstract and underdeveloped as a plot-driving mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and supports the tone and theme well, though sensory detail could be more vivid to fully immerse the reader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but moments of generic phrasing and a lack of narrative surprise reduce its distinctiveness; metaphors are serviceable but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive tone, but the story feels more like a mood piece than a fully realized narrative; lacks urgency or narrative propulsion.</comment>
