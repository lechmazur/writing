<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivations are generally consistent, and her compassion is evident, but her personality lacks depth and nuance; the “sometimes always” trait is vague and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions feel overly smooth and lack tension; the sudden appearance of the stranger is convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues; the carnival enhances the eerie tone and supports the character’s emotional state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels formulaic or overly polished; while not egregiously clichéd, the story lacks a distinctive voice and occasionally slips into generic sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and competent, but plays it safe; the elements are integrated smoothly, yet the narrative doesn’t push boundaries or leave a lasting impression.</comment>
