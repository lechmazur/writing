<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias has a clear arc from jaded to purposeful, but his transformation feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped; Lila’s motivations are revealed too late to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—some transitions feel rushed, and the climax lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story gestures at deeper themes and uses symbolism (gloves, throne), but emotional resonance is muted and the prose occasionally tells rather than shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and tone, but several phrases feel formulaic or overly ornate; the narrative voice lacks a distinct human signature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Creative concept with thematic ambition, but execution is uneven; the story feels more like a clever assembly of elements than a fully organic narrative.</comment>
