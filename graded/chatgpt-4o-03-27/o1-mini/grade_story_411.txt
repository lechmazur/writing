<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story has a beginning, middle, and end, but the logic of the puzzle-solving method and its connection to the fountain is tenuous and abstract, weakening narrative coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses rich imagery, but lacks a clear conflict or tension; the symbolism is heavy-handed and the emotional arc feels more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the language is often lyrical, it veers into purple prose and abstract vagueness; the emotional nuance is more stated than felt, and the originality is diluted by generic metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive in tone and ambition, but the elements feel more decorative than essential; the emotional impact is muted by abstraction and lack of grounded stakes.</comment>
