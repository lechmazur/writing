<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the method of escape—via sculptures and dust—feels more symbolic than logically grounded, slightly weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, with a lingering mood, but lacks the narrative sharpness and emotional precision expected at the highest tier.</comment>
