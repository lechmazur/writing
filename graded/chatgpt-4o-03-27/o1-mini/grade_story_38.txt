<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and thematic resolution, but the pacing occasionally drifts, and transitions between scenes (e.g., subway, after-parties, attic) feel more atmospheric than narratively driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic flair, some phrasing borders on overly ornate, and a few transitions feel formulaic or slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative use of elements and a lingering emotional impact, though it could benefit from tighter narrative focus.</comment>
