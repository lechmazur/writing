<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard keeper is compelling and her motivation—restoring the garden—is clear, reflected in everything from her actions to her bitter laughter; however, the lack of dialogue or deeper psychological exploration limits emotional intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and elegantly structured within the tight limit, with a beginning (the garden’s collapse), middle (discovery of the ink-pattern map), and satisfying climax/resolution; pacing is well-controlled and causality is clear throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and deeply integrated with the narrative; particle-accelerated trees, quantum blooms, and bio-ceramic elements evoke a rich, immersive world that strongly supports mood, tone, and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original and emotionally resonant; metaphor and imagery elevate the prose without tipping into purple; the symbolism of the ink spill as revelation is especially powerful and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mostly avoids formulaic writing, with fresh metaphors and specific imagery; some phrasing flirts with over-elaboration but remains purposeful; originality is strong overall, though emotion remains at a mythic remove from lived human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and deeply imaginative; all elements serve the larger narrative purpose; the story lingers after reading, and the tone, world, and theme converge into a powerful, unified vision.</comment>
