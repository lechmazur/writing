<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara is rendered with emotional depth and coherence; her internal conflict, motivations, and healing practices all feel well-integrated and motivated by her traits and past, though small hints of dialogue or external interaction might have added dimension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a powerful emotional arc within the word limit; resolution feels earned, but the pacing leans slightly toward introspection-heavy, with minimal external action to drive the shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, immersive, and metaphorically resonant with Elara's emotional landscape; rich sensory detail and atmosphere create a cohesive tone that amplifies thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong literary craft—poetic language, effective symbolism (reef, sewing kit, letters), and a subtle but clear emotional journey elevate the story, though ending resolution borders on predictably redemptive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language avoids cliché and purple prose, with original metaphors and intentional word choices; a few moments verging on lyrical excess slightly undercut the otherwise excellent tone control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; use of assigned elements feels organic and thematically unified, with minor improvement possible in narrative dynamism or tension variation.</comment>
