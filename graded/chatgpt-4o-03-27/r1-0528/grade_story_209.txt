<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character is vividly portrayed, with strong internal motivation driven by grief, and his emotional trajectory feels authentic and deeply tied to his actions and the symbolic object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a strong emotional arc and structural clarity within the word limit, yet certain transitions—like the moment of honesty—could benefit from slightly more grounding detail for full satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is powerfully atmospheric with rich sensory detail; the surreal "radio wave garden" and skeletal tower enhance the mood and align with the character's emotional disorientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant with layered symbolism (hairbrush, echo, short-circuit); its honest thematic shift is compelling, though slightly more subtlety in the final realization would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors and fresh pairings (e.g., hairbrush as sensory instrument) enhance depth; a few moments veer into slight thematic overstatement, but overall it's unusually distinct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and artistic unity—each element serves the story's emotional core rather than feeling arbitrarily inserted; the tale lingers emotionally and structurally.</comment>
