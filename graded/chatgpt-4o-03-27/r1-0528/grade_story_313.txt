<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's arc from defiant conman to a figure struck by moral clarity is emotionally resonant and develops with convincing nuance; his motivation is clear, and his change feels earned, though a touch more depth in his backstory would further enrich the transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within tight confines, gracefully shifting from external failure to internal reckoning; pacing is strong and cause-effect chains are logical, though the ghost interaction could unfold with slightly more tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is vivid and immersive—dust, decay, and spectral presences all enhance the story’s emotional terrain and reinforce the futility and dignity of survival; sensory details and mood are finely tuned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (e.g., the tape dispenser), layered themes of failure and dignity, sharp dialogue, and a powerful emotional shift sustain impact; a rare instance of a short piece feeling both intimate and grand in idea.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong avoidance of cliché, with fresh metaphors and an original voice; the ghosts’ calm responses provide a poignant subversion of expectations, though a few lines edge toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve a unified theme of remorse and moral reckoning; the narrative feels sculpted rather than assembled—tight, expressive, and provocatively unresolved in a satisfying way.</comment>
