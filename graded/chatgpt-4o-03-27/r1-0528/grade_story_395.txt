<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris is motivated clearly by duty transformed into moral awakening; her evolution feels authentic, with her rebellious impulse naturally sparked by memory and environment; Kael, though secondary, also feels well-rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a strong arc, balanced pacing, and logical progression; the tilt action is pivotal and satisfying, though the escape resolution borders on too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion and poetic use of the floating island spa setting; atmosphere of wind, light, and rebellion enhances tone and mirrors character emotion beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant prose with layered metaphor and strong thematic cohesion; emotional subtext and imagery resonate well, and subtle callbacks (Festival of Echoes) enrich subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly original, with imaginative setting and emotional nuance; a few narrative turns (e.g., escape via glider) lean slightly on familiar tropes but are redeemed by tone and character depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive narrative that integrates all elements into a lyrical, self-contained arc; story lingers emotionally and thematically, showing strong literary potential.</comment>
