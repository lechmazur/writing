<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s personality as an introspective, amiable scholar is well-rendered through his quiet persistence and emotional reaction to the long-awaited news; his motivations align closely with his actions and worldview, though his inner transformation could be deepened further for maximal impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves impressive coherence and progression within the tight word constraint, building from a quiet expectancy to a resonant emotional climax; however, the narrative could benefit from slightly more tension in the middle to elevate stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse is deeply atmospheric, rendered vividly through sensory cues and metaphor; the setting functions symbolically and practically to reinforce themes of memory, legacy, and illumination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically rich, the story uses metaphor and subtext expertly; the ending is earned and satisfying, though the language occasionally veers toward the overly poetic, risking clarity.</comment>
