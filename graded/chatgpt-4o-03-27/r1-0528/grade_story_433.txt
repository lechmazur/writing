<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is layered and nuanced; her grief, stubbornness, and longing for solace all drive her believable inner conflict, though her “voice” is muted by a lack of direct dialogue or internal monologue that might further distinguish her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and emotionally compelling, culminating in a thematic choice. Some transitions—especially the jump from gallery to prophecy decoding—feel telescoped due to space, slightly disrupting flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric control; the snow-muted city and ephemeral ice sculptures echo the protagonist’s emotional state. Sensory detail is vivid and immersive, enhancing theme and tone throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and literary craft; metaphors like the “avalanche within” and imagery of melting art deepen the central theme. A few moments veer toward telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original fusion of natural imagery and speculative prophecy avoids cliché. Some slightly elevated phrasing borders on ornamental, but metaphor and theme remain fresh and cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite the brevity, the story feels complete and thematically rich. Its central question reverberates beyond the text, though a touch more specificity in key narrative moments would elevate it further.</comment>
