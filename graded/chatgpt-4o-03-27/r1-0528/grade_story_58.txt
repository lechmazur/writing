<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris is richly developed—her loyalty, isolation, and inner conflict are convincingly rendered—but her emotional shift to “cold fury” feels slightly abrupt given her meditative foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative builds coherently from quiet surveillance to a revelation and decision point; the decoding sequence elegantly escalates tension, though resolution is more implied than fully earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moth tower setting and city blackout are evocative, with strong atmospheric detail (e.g., flickering lights, twitching moths) that support tone and theme effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive, immersive, and intellectually provocative; highly publishable with minor refinement for polish and emotional grounding.</comment>
