<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prince's motivation is clearly internal and emotionally resonant, with his actions—brewing tea to soothe loneliness—aligned with his backstory and training. The woman is less developed, but she serves her narrative function well.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a clear arc within tight constraints: exile, encounter, emotional connection, and resolution. Cause-effect relationships are organic, and pacing is well-judged with a resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive, with excellent sensory detail. The customs office is both literal and symbolic—a forgotten threshold where transformation occurs. Tone and setting complement the narrative's emotional core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic language supports mood without becoming overwrought. Symbolism (the mortar, the key, the storm) is potent. Conflict is subtle but real, and the emotional resolution is understated yet effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the premise includes familiar archetypes, the execution avoids clichés through fresh metaphor and restrained sentimentality. Voice is consistent, though slightly polished to the point of occasional sterility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story integrates all elements with craft and emotional subtlety. Its brevity feels deliberate, and the close lingers in the mind. Not flawless, but very close to top-tier publication readiness.</comment>
