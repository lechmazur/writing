<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's character is well-drawn and emotionally resonant, with a consistent arc from haunted protector to a man seeking redemption. His motivations are clearly tied to his past and the doll, and his transformation feels authentic and earned, though a touch more internal dialogue or nuance would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a powerful resolution. The transition from haunted stasis to emotional release is logically structured and paced well within the word count. A minor point of uncertainty in the planetarium-to-resolution link holds it just short of flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and richly sensory, with evocative descriptions of scent, light, and decay. The abandoned circus and celestial imagery deepen the themes of loss and transcendence. Atmosphere strongly supports both tone and motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s symbolic language and emotional layering are skillfully executed. The use of the doll, stars, and scent as metaphors adds depth. Some literary phrasing teeters on overdone but remains mostly controlled. The ending delivers real catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The writing avoids formulaic patterns and offers fresh metaphors and emotional authenticity. Some descriptions edge toward florid, and the 'chance encounter' leans on convenience—but overall, the story feels original and tonally consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is cohesive, emotionally affecting, and lingers after reading. Every element contributes to the arc, and the pacing feels deliberate. A more subtly integrated use of the planetarium detail would enhance this further.</comment>
