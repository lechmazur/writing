<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from stealthy goal to emotional and narrative climax, with a well-placed twist; the resolution is satisfying, though the pacing flirts with being too dense near the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism, emotional resonance, and layered subtext elevate the narrative; the kiss as catalyst and pact is effective, though one more beat of internal doubt might enhance payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of speculative tech and poetic decay, though a few flourishes veer into ornate territory; metaphors are mostly fresh and tied to character psychology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful concept delivered with thematic cohesion, striking prose, and emotional depth; the story lingers, but a touch more clarity in the tech-magic might elevate it to perfection.</comment>
