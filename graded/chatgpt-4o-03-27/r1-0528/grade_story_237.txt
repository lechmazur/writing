<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is compelling and specific, her actions align with her psychic and genealogical talents, and her personality comes through clearly in both her resilience and introspection; however, without direct dialogue, her “voice” could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot forms a clear emotional arc with effective pacing and resolution; the discovery about her sister and the impending urgency are logical and satisfying, though transitions between memory fragments and discovery verge on rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The space pirate brig is evocatively rendered, and the sensory details—morning light, psychic echoes, grimy floor—effectively build atmosphere that mirrors the story’s tone and character journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphor and symbolism (dice, diaries, constellations) add depth; the emotional cadence is absorbing, though the lack of dialogue slightly limits variation in texture; ending is strong and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Despite familiar sci-fi elements, the integration of ancestral memory, ghost trains, and psychic genealogy feels fresh and specific; diction is controlled and expressive, with no signs of mechanical phrasing or narrative leaps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels whole despite complexity; each element contributes meaningfully to emotional and thematic depth, with strong originality, cohesion, and narrative momentum throughout.</comment>
