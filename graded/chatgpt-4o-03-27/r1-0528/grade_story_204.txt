<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is a well-drawn protagonist whose profession, internal conflict, and motivations are organically interwoven; her emotional arc is clear and nuanced, though the father's shift could be more gradually earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is effectively constructed with a clear beginning, middle, and emotional climax; some transitions (e.g., from farmer’s market to gala) feel slightly compressed or abrupt within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized with rich sensory detail and thematic resonance; the decaying spaceport metaphorically supports the emotional and societal decay, enhancing atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story resonates emotionally and uses strong symbolism (punch as respect and connection); the dialogue occasionally verges on overt explanation rather than subtextual delivery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mixture of the spectral and mundane is fresh, avoiding clichés; voice and detail are largely authentic, though some phrases lean toward lyrical excess or generic abstraction ("human need for contact").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive with a strong emotional payoff; creative integration of elements feels mostly organic, though a few supporting details (e.g., the veteran) are underused or perfunctory.</comment>
