<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris is convincingly drawn: his regret, creative frustration, and emotional growth are clear, though he remains slightly elusive, partly due to the lack of dialogue or inner monologue to fully humanize him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is tight and effective; the arc from loss to transformational art is clear and emotionally resonant, though the climax is a touch too smooth and convenient given the complexity of the journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sensory-rich environments—from the frost to the roaring falls to the ancient library—are immersive and deeply aligned with the mood and themes of ephemerality and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor and symbolism, especially the transformation of regret into art; the final fireworks display is visually and emotionally powerful, though slightly idealized in its resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While there are moments of elevated diction, the imagery generally feels fresh and purposeful; the integration of scientific and poetic detail avoids cliché and elevates the narrative meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong conceptual unity, lyrical execution, and evocative emotional depth—minor polish needed in pacing and human nuance, but overall highly publishable with a few edits.</comment>
