<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sir Gareth's motivations are deeply embedded and unfold organically through memory and symbol; his arc from repression to release is emotionally coherent and subtly rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot presents a complete emotional arc, but pacing nearly falters under symbolic weight; the central decision and its consequences resolve the narrative powerfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly drawn and symbolically rich, enhancing mood and internal conflict through sensory detail and metaphor without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative prose and symbolic imagery (Lyra, fractured lens) work together to build emotional resonance; subtext and metaphor elevate the grief journey without overt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structure and clich√©s; metaphors are fresh and meaningful, though some emotional beats approach the edge of overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This is a cohesive, emotionally rich piece with thematic unity; the tight word limit feels intentional, not restrictive, and the elements enhance rather than burden the narrative.</comment>
