<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation—to find meaningful connection—is clearly stated and reflected in his actions, especially in how he engages with the poltergeist. However, his characterization lacks subtle evolution beyond that single drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is clean with a distinct arc: discovery, supernatural disruption, understanding, and resolution. Cause-effect is logical, and pacing is well-controlled despite the complexity of elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The villa setting is atmospherically rich and reinforced through sensory details like dust, sound, and texture. The tone supports the eerie-yet-introspective mood, grounding the supernatural in a tangible world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection and emotion, using symbolism (e.g., thread, box) effectively. While slightly expository at times, it displays thematic depth and restraint, with a gratifying ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>There are moments of originality—especially in how the narrative interprets the poltergeist's language—but occasional poetic overreach and minor generic phrasing weaken the overall freshness slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story succeeds in combining disparate elements cohesively and with emotional resonance. While not flawless, it is polished and purposeful, worthy of serious consideration for publication.</comment>
