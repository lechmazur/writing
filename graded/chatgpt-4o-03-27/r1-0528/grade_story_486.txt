<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and drives the plot; her personality—clumsily dexterous—is subtly reflected in the tension between her hesitant physicality and confident magical fluency, though more internal reflection could deepen her character further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete, with a clear arc from preparation to climax to resolution; the method of retribution is well-integrated, though transitions between scenes could be slightly more fluid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory details (chalk dust, coloured light, imagined noise); the witch’s room and cathedral debris deepen tone and setting meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotion and theme emerge through metaphor and visual imagery; the silent pantomimes are impactful and original, though slightly more subtextual nuance would elevate the climax’s emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Generally avoids clichés and AI tells, offering a fresh central metaphor and engaging symbolism; minor moments of overwritten imagery slightly detract from otherwise strong stylistic control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with all elements working toward the central theme of truth and silence; the story feels deliberately crafted, though a few prose embellishments could be tightened.</comment>
