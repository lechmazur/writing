<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael is a deeply conflicted character whose internal flaws and moral struggle are consistently and subtly rendered through his reactions and memories; his arc is emotionally resonant despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is impressively cohesive given its constraints — the sculptor's chisel strike neatly triggers the climax, and the transformation metaphorically and structurally resolves the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic setting is atmospheric and symbolic, with evocative sensory details that reinforce themes of stagnation, memory, and decay — a near-perfect reflection of Kael's inner world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Powerful and layered, with deft imagery (e.g., spectral chains, the dissolving attic) and a tightly-woven metaphorical arc that leaves a lasting impression and reflection on identity and failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clichés and formulaic writing, using original metaphor and subtext to explore familiar themes in fresh ways, though some lines flirt with overwriting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The elements feel expertly curated rather than forced, and the story’s arc — though abstract — is emotionally complete and thematically rich, lingering after the final line.</comment>
