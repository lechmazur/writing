<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from discovery to revelation, with a clear arc, although the pacing edges toward dense near the climax, and the resolution, while satisfying, feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal geode setting is richly imagined and supports the mysterious tone and metaphysical themes powerfully; vivid sensory detail (light, mist, scent) effectively builds a compelling, immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story delivers thematic resonance (skepticism vs wonder), effective metaphor (roller coaster, mist), and emotional impact; while not groundbreaking, the craft is confident and layered.</comment>
