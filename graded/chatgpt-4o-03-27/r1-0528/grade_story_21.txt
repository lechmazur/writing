<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael is rendered with psychological depth—his grief, vengeance, and abrasively composed demeanor are intricately intertwined and consistently reflected in his physical actions and internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story holds together tightly: the pacing is deliberate, the action escalates smoothly, and there’s a coherent arc from investigation to grim discovery; however, the ending is emotionally powerful but lacks a clear shift or turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and tonal consistency create a decaying, post-traumatic world that enhances the psychological stakes and tension—setting and atmosphere are superbly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism (e.g., tassel, synthetics, mural), and subtext-rich prose elevate the storytelling—the emotional resonance and thematic maturity are strong, though the ending could carry more dramatic finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stylistically consistent, emotionally controlled, and avoids cliché—only minor over-formality in diction and slightly predictable revenge framing prevent a perfect originality score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Each element is woven with purpose into a haunting, intelligent narrative that lingers through its fusion of character grief and bio-sleuthing—it feels polished and nearly publication-ready.</comment>
