<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal struggle and cautious resilience are emotionally vivid and consistent, though her "loudly introverted" trait is more poetic than actionable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is elegant and complete, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; slight abstraction limits clarity in the causal mechanics of the fireflies and sound sequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the interplay between setting, theme, and action is deliberate and evocative, though subtle variations in tone could enhance authenticity.</comment>
