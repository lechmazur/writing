<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is compelling and well-rooted in her identity as a righteously flawed alien liaison; her fear and resolve are subtly layered, though there’s room for a sharper voice or more dialogue to deepen individual nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc with clear motivation, rising tension, and a resonant resolution; the pacing is excellent given the constraint, though the climax edges toward melodrama.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly rendered through sound, architecture, and metaphor; the sensory evocation of the bathhouse's rebirth is immersive and thematically potent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of symbolism and poetic language lends emotional weight, though some imagery feels slightly overwrought rather than precise; its emotional resonance is strong, if not unforgettable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Despite using some familiar tropes (hidden knowledge, alien disguise), the story subverts cliché with sincerity and elegance; language occasionally verges on purple prose but mostly serves its theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive, deftly layered, and emotionally satisfying; the integration of theme, plot, and tone suggests strong authorial control and a lasting impact beyond the word limit.</comment>
