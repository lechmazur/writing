<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brother Elias is clearly defined through introspection, humor, and consistent motivation; his reactions reveal depth, but some emotional beats feel slightly self-conscious rather than fully lived-in.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arc is tightly constructed with a clear beginning, escalation, and resolution; the absurd method is logically integrated, though the elevator subplot feels slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly described with immersive sensory details; the phosphorescent flora, geothermal oven, and echoes create a vivid, atmospheric world that supports the tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional and thematic resonance, clever use of symbolism (scissor, bread), and effective irony; tone is masterfully sustained, though the ending may feel slightly too neatly ironic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of elements, with fresh metaphorical language and emotional nuance; a few moments hint at over-construction, but voice and style feel distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements serve the story's goals with creativity and cohesion; the absurd plot premise gains unexpected poignancy, though the elevator's role could have been more integrated.</comment>
