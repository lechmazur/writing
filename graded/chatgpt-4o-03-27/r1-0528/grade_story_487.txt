<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas is richly rendered; his docility and grief drive every choice, with strong symbolic and emotional resonance. His motivation is compelling and consistent, though Kael remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story follows a tight arc from discovery to unintended resolution. Cause and effect are well-handled. The twist is organically seeded and satisfying, though Kael's role could be more structurally integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse labyrinth and vibrating conservatory are vivid and immersive. Atmosphere enhances tension and supports theme, with sensory details interwoven seamlessly into the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The twist is thematically rich, and the imagery is evocative. The emotional impact lingers, though Kael’s unintelligibility limits dialogue nuance. Symbolism of pacification over resurrection is deeply poignant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphor (“mold a myth from the mud of reality”), strong subversion of resurrection trope, and human nuance in Silas’s gentle strength elevate the piece far above formulaic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stylistically cohesive and emotionally resonant. Every element serves the theme, and the story achieves layered depth in minimal space. A few areas verge on poetic excess but not distractingly so.</comment>
