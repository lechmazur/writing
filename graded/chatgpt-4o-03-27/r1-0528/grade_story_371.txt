<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivations are powerfully established and consistent, and his characterization as a weary, defiant relic of past heroism is vivid, though slightly muted by a lack of dialogue or interaction with others that might deepen nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is cleanly executed and ties together beginning, middle, and resolution within the tight word limit, though the marble-decoding step—while imaginative—pushes plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric language and sensory detail are outstanding, immersing the reader in a rain-soaked, neon-lit dystopia that supports character and theme with precision and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant with symbolic weight (hatpin, marbles) and thematic cohesion; while poetic, the prose sometimes verges on over-embellished, slightly hindering clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Several tropes (cyberpunk orphan-savior, glowing artifact) are used, but they’re executed with enough freshness and metaphorical layering to avoid predictability; touches of purple prose diminish authenticity slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, emotionally potent, and thematically strong; minor weaknesses in pacing and over-stylization prevent a perfect score, but the story leaves a strong, lingering impression.</comment>
