<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kenji’s and Aiko’s motivations are nuanced and consistently revealed through gesture and observation; their subtle emotional arcs feel psychologically authentic and tethered to their personalities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a quiet but complete arc within the word limit, with the repositioned book marking a turning point; pacing is well-managed, though the middle risks lingering too long in introspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The castle-as-school setting is richly atmospheric—the mist, the night sky, the sensory textures of paper and parchment—all build a tangible mood that mirrors the characters’ interior states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Refined use of metaphor (stars and flowers) deepens the emotional resonance; the subtextual conversation through art is affecting, though the theme could be made just slightly more distinct.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While some metaphors risk bordering on lyrical excess, the story avoids formula and presents a fresh narrative voice, though certain turns—like the constellation decoding—felt more aesthetic than functional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant piece with layers of symbolism and a sense of quiet revelation; slightly abstract in places, but the core connection between characters is powerful and earned.</comment>
