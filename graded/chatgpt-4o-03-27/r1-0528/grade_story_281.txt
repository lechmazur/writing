<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silas's journey from self-preserving thief to someone questioning his worldview is nuanced and effectively rendered through his poetic struggle with Erasmus, though the shift borders on overly symbolic at moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure maintains coherence and a satisfying arc under a tight limit, but the central device—impromptu poetry with a haunted dummy—strains plausibility slightly, impacting immersion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory detail (humming air, scent of brine and rust) deeply tied to tone and theme; the lighthouse setting vibrantly supports the transformation arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The poetic metaphor is ambitious and layered, and the eerie dialogue elevates the tension; Erasmus's critiques function as both plot and thematic driver, though a few lines veer close to overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original premise and fresh execution of transformation theme; slight unevenness in word choice and some poetic transitions feel mechanically abrupt, mildly undercutting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, thematically rich piece with a haunting emotional resolution; manages complex elements with impressive clarity under length constraints, though verges on stylized excess in parts.</comment>
