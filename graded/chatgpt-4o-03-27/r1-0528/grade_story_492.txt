<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eli's internal conflict and avoidance of confrontation contrast well with his decisive analog infiltration, showing growth; motivation is clear and tied to his identity, though dialogue or deeper internal reflection could further enrich voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The infiltration arc is tight and coherent with strong cause-effect logic; the resolution delivers emotional payoff. However, early pacing is dense, and transitions could be marginally smoother within the limited space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory detail (neon rain, oily puddles, humming ducts) builds an immersive, moody world; setting and object are meaningfully entwined in both action and tone, enhancing emotional atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story resonates emotionally, especially in the final scene; symbolic use of analog vs digital reinforces theme. Though writing is evocative, some phrasing edges on overwrought, slightly diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong originality in merging a blacksmith's tools with a cyberpunk setting; avoids tropes and cliches. Some metaphors verge on purple, but emotional nuance is handled with restraint and specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion of disparate elements into a compelling arc; the story feels deliberate despite brevity. A few transitions are slightly abrupt, but creative synthesis and emotional weight carry it.</comment>
