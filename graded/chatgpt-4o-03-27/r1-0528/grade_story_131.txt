<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eli's emotional arc is clear and well grounded in his aloof personality, with motivation evolving convincingly from avoidance to acceptance; a bit more interiority or specificity could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Excellent narrative arc within the tight word count, though some transitions feel compressed; the story achieves resolution but lacks a single strong inciting event.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Far from formulaic, with thoughtful symbolism and emotional nuance, but a few overly polished transitions and faint echoes of familiar tropes reduce freshness slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Well-crafted and resonant, the story weaves assigned elements into a cohesive narrative that lingers, though its emotional impact could be deepened with more specificity.</comment>
