<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's motivations are deeply embedded in his actions and symbols like the mechanical arm and the sock; his emotional turn under pressure feels human and consistent with his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is compact and mostly coherent, with a strong midpoint disruption and clear climax; minor leaps in logic (e.g., Lysandra's sudden arrival) slightly strain plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting powerfully evokes isolation and faded grandeur that mirrors Silas's mental state; vivid sensory detail enhances mood and supports the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance around ambition and reality; symbolism (e.g., dreamstuff sock) is clever and layered, though the ending, while poignant, leans slightly expositional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery is often inventive ("tangibly abstract light"); some metaphorical density risks purple prose but overall demonstrates a unique stylistic voice and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly weaves abstract themes with compelling imagery and characterâ€”minor structural strains prevent a perfect score, but it lingers with the reader effectively.</comment>
