<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hermit’s motivation to coax life from barren ground is powerfully rendered through his contemplative actions and symbolic tools; his quiet defiance is consistent and emotionally resonant, though his character lacks deeper backstory or internal contrast that would elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot maintains a strong internal logic and offers a clear arc from barren decay to blossoming hope, but the pacing flirts with overwriting—occasionally slowing momentum with dense metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and eerie, the comet and orchard merging into a haunting atmosphere that supports both mood and metaphor; sensory detail enhances the otherworldly tone with precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is rich with layered symbolism and philosophical resonance; the comet, album, and weathervane function as metaphors for loss, memory, and resistance, though the prose sometimes veers into overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The originality is strong, especially in combining arcane ritual with ecological rebirth; however, a few metaphors feel self-consciously poetic, pulling the reader slightly out of the moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A tightly woven piece with thematic unity and emotional payoff; its delicate tension between despair and hope lingers, though slight pruning could enhance its clarity without losing impact.</comment>
