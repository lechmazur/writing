<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris is convincingly torn between duty and regret, with her hesitation and internal conflict clearly informed by her past and the symbolic compass—but her emotional journey could use one more beat to deepen the transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story arc is tight and coherent, with clear setup, rising tension, climax, and resolution—all elegantly compressed; some transitions verge on abstraction but generally serve the momentum well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized; the chamber is atmospheric and integral to tone, action, and symbolism—evoking unease and reverence in equal measure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful emotional undertone, rich subtext about sacrifice and loss, and strong use of imagery and metaphor; only slight narrative distancing blunts an otherwise exceptional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Symbolism is precise, phrasing is poetic but controlled—it avoids clichés, though a few metaphors (e.g., "savage serenity") border on stylized repetition rather than inventive expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically mature—only restrained by occasional over-reliance on abstraction rather than visceral specificity in key emotional moments.</comment>
