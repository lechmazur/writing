<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The main character is distinct, with motivations clearly linked to his grief and philosophical yearning. His emotional evolution feels authentic, though some supporting characters feel flat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying emotional arc, connecting beginning to end well, but the flash mob section feels abruptly inserted and disrupts the otherwise steady pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The particle accelerator is richly atmospheric, evoking sterility and existential weight. The juxtaposition with the dancer and the hum of machines enhances the emotional tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story offers fresh metaphors and avoids formulaic phrasing. The portrayal of grief through abstract scientific space is original, though a few lines veer toward poetic clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels complete and cohesive, with well-used motifs and emotional depth, though slight dissonance in the flash mob element keeps it from top-tier polish.</comment>
