<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Léa’s character is vividly defined through her tactile relationship with small, discarded treasures and her protective instinct; her motivations are consistent and drive the plot with emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is elegant and complete, a tightly bound encounter turned negotiation; however, the pacing falters slightly in the transition from fair to vault, which feels mildly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are exceptionally well-rendered; sensory details (yeast, light, music) heighten the tension and enhance contrast between spectacle and authenticity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional resonance, strong imagery (sapphire bird, sacred sky), and smart subtext on preservation vs. commodification; the ending is quiet but powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong originality in character concept and thematic depth; a few lines edge toward poetic cliché, but overall avoids formula and relies on specific, fresh metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with layered meaning and elegant brevity; it feels like a deliberate miniature, not a constrained sample—minor flaws in tempo prevent a perfect score.</comment>
