<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong internal consistency and transformation arc; the confused diplomat evolves believably through metaphor and reflection, though lacks some vivid personal detail or dialogue for full dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and emotionally resonant within the constraints; the shift from confusion to insight is well-paced, though the action resolution remains more symbolic than active.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building; setting is immersive, atmospheric, and thematically interwoven with character conflict—sensory descriptions are rich yet restrained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism and metaphor (birds, key) deepen theme; emotionally evocative with lasting imagery, though a shade more narrative tension or unpredictability would elevate it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original concept and nuanced tone; some repetition in phrasing and metaphor edges toward overwrought, but overall voice is distinct and reflective rather than mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unified vision and strong thematic consistency; ends on a poetic yet purposeful note—story feels intentional rather than constrained by brevity.</comment>
