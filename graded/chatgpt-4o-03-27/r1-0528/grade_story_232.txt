<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Aris’s obsession is well-established and consistent, but his internal voice lacks depth; he’s defined more by his quest than personal complexity or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is tight and coherent; the narrative arc is clear and complete within its constraints, though the ending moves slightly too quickly to feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospherically grounded; sensory details evoke tension and mystery, though the digital nomad context isn’t deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some moments feel fresh—particularly the coffee symbolism—but occasional turns verge on algorithmic; metaphors repeat and some phrasing lacks human idiosyncrasy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesive and emotionally resonant, but it falls just short of literary excellence due to occasional flat prose and lack of narrative surprise.</comment>
