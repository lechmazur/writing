<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The oracle is vividly drawn, with clear motivation and symbolic dependence; her emotional state and motivation integrate tightly with her actions and the surreal setting, though her personal voice remains somewhat distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot’s arc from despair to hope is coherent and poetic within constraints; while pacing is steady and resolution satisfying, some transitions feel slightly abstract, blurring clarity of cause-effect in moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully immersive; sensory details (dust, scent, hum) evoke a lucid dream-state that enhances character and thematic resonance without excess description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emotional arc is haunting and resonant; rich imagery and metaphor elevate the storytelling, though the dense poetic language slightly obscures narrative drive at points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The metaphorical prose is often fresh and evocative, though occasionally borders on purple; originality is high, avoiding cliché, but the repetition of certain emotional cues slightly mutes nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story lingers meaningfully, with a thoughtful fusion of surrealism and emotional stakes; brevity feels precise, not constrained, though a touch more clarity in method would elevate it further.</comment>
