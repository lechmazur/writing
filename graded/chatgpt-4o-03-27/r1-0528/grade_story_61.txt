<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is compelling and her motivations clear; her "timidly bold" nature and reverence for her grandmother's sacrifice add depth, though emotional progression could be more layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and climactic, using dream scraps and action effectively; pacing is excellent, though some explanatory phrasing veers close to over-narration.</comment>
