<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s characterization is strong: her headstrong nature aligns with her defiant drive to transform the world, and her inner conflict is well-rendered; only minor nuance is missing in exploring how her past informs her emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story arc is coherent and emotionally satisfying, with a clear progression from tension to resolution; slight compression of the climax under the word limit reduces the payoff’s clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thoughtful, emotionally charged, and unusually cohesive for the format; the story leaves a lingering impression of beauty defying ruin.</comment>
