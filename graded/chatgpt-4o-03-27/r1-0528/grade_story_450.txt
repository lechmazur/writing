<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn, with clear internal conflict and an arc from denial to revelation; her dancer's mind and frustration with her family's linguistic failings meaningfully inform her motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed, moving logically from introspection to climactic fulfillment; the use of the family photo ritual as structural anchor is ingenious, though the prophetic twist resolution feels a touch abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric use of the thought experiment chamber, layered with sensory details (steam, flickering lights, tactile memory), elevates the emotional texture and supports the surreal tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Powerful imagery, layered symbolism (mirror, patch, constellation), and emotional payoff through movement lend poetic resonance; the thematic reveal is impactful and well-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original metaphors and fresh worldbuilding counterbalance moments of vague abstraction; largely avoids formula but skirts ambiguity in moments that could have been clearer or more grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant whole that balances speculative elements with emotional realism; the brevity feels deliberate, and the narrative lingers meaningfully after its end.</comment>
