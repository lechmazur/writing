<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gareth’s hopefulness and clever naivety are consistently portrayed and tied to his decisions; however, his emotional interiority remains somewhat underdeveloped, limiting deeper character resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative has a clear arc with strong cause-effect progression and resolution; some transitions are slightly abrupt, but the structure holds cohesively within tight constraints.</comment>
