<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is thematically rich and consistent, but emotional depth is distanced by the aloof prose; we feel his purpose more than his person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story arcs from grief to transcendence with clarity and momentum; the churn’s activation and the poster's transformation are compellingly linked, though the climax edges into abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined, immersive, and tenebrous; sensory metaphors (e.g., “scent of rain on dry earth”) are evocative and reinforce mood, though some phrases strain clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The symbolic layering—illusion, decay, ascension—is deft; the churn becomes mythic. Rich in imagery and theme, though clarity sometimes bows under poetic density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Unusual object-concept synergy (butter churn, rebellious sparks) and metaphoric layering feel fresh; occasionally leans toward over-stylization, but largely avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally resonant, with a tone of elegiac surrealism; a few overwritten moments detract from precision, but overall, the story lingers in the mind.</comment>
