<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and reserved boldness are subtly but clearly depicted, with her motivation consistently aligned with her internal struggle; however, deeper emotional layering or a small unpredictable choice would have elevated her dimensionality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric depth is exceptional—neon, ozone, decaying city—all vividly rendered; setting and mood are deeply entwined with theme and character, though a more grounded sense of temporal progression could improve immersion.</comment>
