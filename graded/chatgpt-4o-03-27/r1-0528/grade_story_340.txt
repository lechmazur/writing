<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn, his faded pride and lingering rivalry with Arcturus shaping his decisions; Pip provides a strong foil, though some beats feel slightly compressed due to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc—conflict, escalation, and resolution—all neatly within the limit; the "youthify" twist reorients the plot in a surprising yet coherent way.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is lush and original, with consistent sensory cues—vines, mushroom stools, ozone—that enhance both mood and stakes; the treehouse city feels alive and thematically relevant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally satisfying; excellent synergy of elements and style—narrative feels deliberate and highly polished within constraints.</comment>
