<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Impressively original use of sci-fi motifs, though the automaton’s characterization could verge slightly on trope without subversion; mostly avoids formulaic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High level of cohesion across all story elements; the tone, setting, and actions feel purpose-built rather than reverse-engineered around requirements.</comment>
