<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The paladin’s weariness and subtle transformation are effectively portrayed; motivations align with personality, though the woman's character feels thinner by comparison.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear arc with a compelling trigger (the blackout) and satisfying resolution; pacing well-managed, though the final transition skims heavy restoration work too quickly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive; each element feels integrated into a complete narrative arc with meaningful stakes and a lingering sense of quiet rediscovery.</comment>
