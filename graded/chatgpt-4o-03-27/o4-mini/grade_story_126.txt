<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is clear and consistent, with his honestly strange temperament and symbolic use of the butter churn reinforcing his defiance and emotional depth; however, his voice remains somewhat abstract and distant, limiting full emotional immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the ascent through the poster is imaginative, though the transition from metaphor to literal action strains believability slightly.</comment>
