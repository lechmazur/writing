<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prophet's motivations are clear and consistent, and his estrangement of others aligns with his vision-driven personality; however, the scholar remains underdeveloped, and the prophet's voice, while poetic, lacks distinct individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the laundromat scene feels slightly disjointed from the rest of the narrative's tone and pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with evocative sensory details and a surreal, dreamlike tone that enhances the story’s themes and setting; the giant’s study and cosmic imagery are particularly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, using metaphor and symbolism effectively; however, the lack of concrete conflict or tension slightly diminishes its narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The language is often lyrical and original, but occasionally veers into overwrought or abstract phrasing; some transitions feel formulaic, and the laundromat scene borders on cliché without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and leaves a lingering impression, with strong thematic unity and stylistic consistency; minor tonal dissonance and occasional abstraction prevent a higher score.</comment>
