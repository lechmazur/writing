<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The necromancer’s jittery nature is consistent and his motivation clear, but his emotional arc lacks depth and nuance; we see fear and resolve, but not much internal complexity or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but some transitions feel abrupt and overly reliant on atmospheric cues rather than cause-effect logic; pacing is mostly effective but slightly overloaded with imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The retro video game world is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and thematic cohesion; the atmosphere enhances both tension and surrealism, though occasionally borders on over-description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, especially in the mural and fishhook; the story evokes intrigue and unease, though emotional resonance is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Inventive and stylistically distinct, but some phrases verge on overwritten or ornamental; avoids clichés, though a few metaphors feel algorithmic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Despite minor flaws, the story is cohesive, imaginative, and thematically rich; it leaves a lingering impression and suggests deeper layers beneath the surface narrative.</comment>
