<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character is vividly drawn with a consistent and unique personality—his obsessive politeness and scholarly obsession are well-aligned and drive the narrative, though his emotional arc remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the climax feels slightly rushed, and the stakes, while imaginative, remain abstract.</comment>
