<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcellus is richly drawn, with his spinelessness manifesting in both posture and psychological fragility; his motivation is consistent and thematically resonant, though his arc could benefit from more internal conflict or transformation earlier in the piece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a poetic arc with a clear climax (the breaking of the owl), but the plot progression leans more on mood than causality, which slightly weakens narrative momentum and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and vividly rendered, with sensory detail and atmosphere deeply entwined with theme and character; the greenhouse city under toxic rain is both literal and metaphorical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphor elevate the storytelling; the symbolism of the owl and tears is powerful, and the emotional resonance lingers, though the ending could be slightly more surprising or ambiguous to deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While some phrases verge on ornate, the language is largely purposeful and original; metaphors are fresh, though a few moments risk overwriting or repetition of tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with strong integration of elements and a haunting tone; minor issues with pacing and predictability prevent a perfect score.</comment>
