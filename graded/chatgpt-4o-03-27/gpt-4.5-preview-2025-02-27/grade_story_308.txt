<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn, emotionally resonant character whose internal conflict and motivation are clearly aligned with his actions; his bashfulness and profession contrast meaningfully with his artistic passion, though his arc resolves a bit too neatly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution within the word limit, though the pacing is slightly front-loaded with exposition, and the climax, while effective, could benefit from more tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio and festival atmosphere are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, enhancing the mood and supporting the character’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes genuine emotion and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the dolphin keychain), though some moments lean toward telling rather than showing, slightly diminishing the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and presents a fresh premise, a few phrases verge on sentimental or overly polished, and the resolution feels slightly idealized, reducing its emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and creatively integrates its elements, though it stops just short of profound insight or narrative risk-taking that would elevate it to the highest tier.</comment>
