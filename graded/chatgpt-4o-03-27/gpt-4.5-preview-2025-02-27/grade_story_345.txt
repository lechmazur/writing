<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with a clear arc from passive faithlessness to active self-determination; his motivations are consistent and symbolically reinforced by the abacus, though his "unapologetically confused" trait is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a strong internal logic and a satisfying arc within the word limit; the journey through the orchard is coherent and purposeful, though the resolution is slightly too neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The surreal orchard and atmospheric details are vivid and immersive, with strong sensory language and symbolic resonance that enhance the story’s tone and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (abacus, snow patterns, labyrinth) creates emotional depth and thematic richness; the ending is resonant, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally avoids clichés and shows stylistic ambition, but some phrases feel slightly formulaic or overly poetic, and the emotional nuance could be more subtly rendered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Well-crafted and cohesive with a clear theme and emotional payoff; the story feels complete and thoughtfully constructed, though not quite transcendent in originality.</comment>
