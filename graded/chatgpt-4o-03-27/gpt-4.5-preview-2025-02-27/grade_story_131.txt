<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s transformation is emotionally resonant and consistent with his aloof orphan identity; his motivation to turn fear into courage is clearly demonstrated through action, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the anomaly’s origin and resolution feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a satisfying emotional arc; the story lingers with thematic depth, though not groundbreaking in originality.</comment>
