<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias is emotionally resonant and consistent, but Clara remains underdeveloped beyond her symbolic role; his stamp collecting is evocative but under-integrated into his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the bootleg recordings feel like a vestigial plot device rather than an active driver of the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing leans toward poetic clich√©, and the emotional beats are occasionally too on-the-nose; however, the story avoids formulaic structure and shows stylistic intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite minor inconsistencies, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically unified; it lingers with quiet poignancy.</comment>
