<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is rendered with emotional depth and consistency; his motivations are clear and his actions—crafting a sculpture for his daughter—align with his character. However, his "professionally wild" trait is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, with the climax (the sculpture reveal) arriving early and the ending feeling slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and emotional payoff; the story feels complete and purposeful, though a few elements feel more ornamental than essential.</comment>
