<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo's internal conflict and growth are well-rendered, with his motivations and emotional arc aligning clearly with his actions; however, Edrin's character, while charming, remains more archetypal than fully dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the nest discovery and reconstruction provide a strong narrative spine, though the pacing slightly lingers in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard is vividly imagined and thematically resonant, enhancing the mood and symbolism; sensory details are subtle but effective, grounding the surreal setting in emotional realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (nest, static, orchard) enriches the emotional impact; the theme of self-acceptance is gracefully conveyed, though the dialogue occasionally leans toward the didactic.</comment>
