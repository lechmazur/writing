<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is subtly but effectively drawn; his hesitance and emotional depth align with his lukewarm magic and quiet resolve, though Aria's motivations are less developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional climax, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and the resolution feels a touch too convenient given the complexity of the conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar base is vividly rendered with poetic atmosphere; the setting enhances the emotional tone and supports the themes of isolation and hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (fog, silhouettes, doormat), with emotional resonance and thematic depth; however, some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally avoids clich√© and shows stylistic intent, but a few phrases feel slightly generic or overly ornate, and the emotional beats are occasionally too on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive tone; the story lingers emotionally, though it could benefit from slightly more narrative tension or surprise.</comment>
