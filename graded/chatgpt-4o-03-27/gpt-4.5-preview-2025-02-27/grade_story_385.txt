<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias has a clear motivation and a consistent arc, but his "pleasant meddler" and "openly manipulative" traits are underdeveloped and mostly told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the method of discovery (footprints, skates) strains plausibility and feels overly symbolic without grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on overwrought; the narrative avoids clich√©s but occasionally feels like it's following a symbolic template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Despite some strained elements, the story is cohesive, imaginative, and leaves a lingering impression, though not yet at a publishable polish.</comment>
