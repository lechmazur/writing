<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alaric’s arc from despair to redemption is emotionally resonant and clearly motivated by his silent vow; however, his internal voice lacks some distinctiveness, and his transformation, while powerful, could benefit from more nuanced psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the pacing is strong, though the transition from vision to vow feels slightly rushed.</comment>
