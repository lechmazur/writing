<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with a clear arc from self-deceptive philosopher to honest storyteller; Mira’s challenge catalyzes believable growth, though her own motivations are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc and resolution within the word limit, though the transition from Elias’s deceit to honesty feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh imagery and a unique setting; avoids clichés, though a few phrases verge on poetic excess and Mira’s entrance feels slightly formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Well-crafted, emotionally resonant, and thematically cohesive; minor pacing and dialogue issues prevent it from reaching the highest tier of literary polish.</comment>
