<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed through consistent internal conflict, symbolic use of the bead, and a clear, emotionally grounded motivation; however, his "artfully clumsy" trait feels underexplored beyond a single moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a strong arc and logical flow, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the climax feels slightly rushed, and the method's mechanics could be more clearly integrated into the plot's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere that supports tone and theme; the decaying waiting area and holographic contrast are particularly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with strong symbolism and subtext; however, some phrasing borders on overwrought, slightly diminishing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally avoids clich√©s and shows originality in concept and tone, but a few metaphors and emotional beats feel familiar or slightly formulaic, and the mirror method lacks full clarity or innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and emotional depth, with creative integration of elements and a lingering thematic resonance; minor clarity issues and slight over-description prevent a higher score.</comment>
