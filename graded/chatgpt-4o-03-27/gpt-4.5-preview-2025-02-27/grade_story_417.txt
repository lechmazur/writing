<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias and Clara are distinct, with Elias’s zealotry and vulnerability well-developed; his emotional arc is believable and nuanced, though Clara’s internal world could be more deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly static—more dynamic tension or stakes could enhance narrative propulsion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise and tone; avoids clichés and purple prose, though some phrasing edges toward literary affectation rather than organic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally satisfying; the elements feel integrated rather than imposed, though a slightly sharper thematic twist would elevate it further.</comment>
