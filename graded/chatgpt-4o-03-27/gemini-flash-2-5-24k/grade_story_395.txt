<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s internal conflict between duty and rebellion is well-drawn, and his trust in Lyra feels earned; however, Lyra’s character remains underdeveloped beyond her function in the plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with strong cause-effect logic; the infiltration method is plausible and well-integrated, though the climax resolves a bit too smoothly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating island spa is vividly rendered with sensory detail and atmosphere that enhances the tone and action; the bioluminescent flora and mist-shrouded gardens are particularly evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a quiet emotional resonance and uses metaphor effectively (e.g., the forgotten dance); however, the prose occasionally leans toward exposition over immersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrasing feels slightly generic or overly polished, and Lyra’s unpredictability is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic unity; the story feels complete and thoughtful, with a satisfying emotional arc and a subtle shift in Kaelen’s worldview.</comment>
