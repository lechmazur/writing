<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clearly tied to her role and personality; her transition from whimsical tinkerer to urgent sculptor is emotionally and logically consistent, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical progression, with the fortune-tellers triggering a shift in Elara’s actions; however, the pacing slightly lingers in introspection at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., sculpting data into metal), with emotional resonance and thematic depth; however, the prose occasionally leans toward over-explanation rather than subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original concept and execution with minimal cliché; some phrasing borders on ornate, but overall the story avoids formulaic patterns and maintains a unique voice and structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thematically rich; the story integrates its elements with purpose and leaves a lasting impression, though a slightly tighter focus could elevate it further.</comment>
