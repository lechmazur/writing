<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is subtly but effectively drawn; his motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions—puppet shows using symbolic dentures—align with his quiet mission. However, his internal complexity could be deepened further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying emotional rhythm, but lacks a strong narrative pivot or escalation; it leans more on atmosphere than plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory detail and a tone that perfectly complements the story’s emotional undercurrent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, with strong symbolism and subtext, though it skirts the edge of being too static or meditative for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution; the use of dentures as a symbol is unexpected and effective, and the tone avoids cliché. A few phrases verge on ornate, but overall voice is distinct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally affecting, with a strong sense of purpose and style; minor pacing issues and lack of narrative tension prevent a perfect score.</comment>
