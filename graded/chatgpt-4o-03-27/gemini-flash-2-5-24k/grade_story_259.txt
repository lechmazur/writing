<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—using the telescope to trace digital origin myths—align well with her cryptic, introspective nature; however, her emotional arc remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the inciting incident (double-booking) feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the deeper narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive and cohesive with a lingering thematic impact; the story feels like a deliberate, artful vignette rather than a constrained flash piece.</comment>
