<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchardist's transformation from isolation to connection is convincingly motivated and emotionally resonant; Elara's role as catalyst is well-executed, though her own arc remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional pivot; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the resolution, while touching, borders on predictable.</comment>
