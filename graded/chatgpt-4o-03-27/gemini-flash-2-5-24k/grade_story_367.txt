<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered through consistent motivation and behavior; his obsession and physical decline are tightly interwoven, though his emotional depth could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story maintains internal coherence and a meditative arc, but lacks a clear turning point or escalation, which slightly weakens narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and thematically unified; the brevity feels intentional, though the lack of narrative progression may limit broader appeal.</comment>
