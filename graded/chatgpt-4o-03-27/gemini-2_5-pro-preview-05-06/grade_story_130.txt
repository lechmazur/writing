<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s emotional trajectory—from lost apprentice to quietly self-accepting wanderer—is rendered with striking subtlety; her motivations and evolution feel organic, though some reactions lean toward introspective abstraction over concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Despite the quiet, reflective arc, there’s a clear structure: crisis, catalyst, transformation; pacing is strong, though the middle risks drifting in tone, and resolution leans more thematic than plot-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is richly imagined and integral to tone and metaphor; sensory immersion is subtle but effective, with strong symbolic resonance between setting and character state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deeply evocative and thematically resonant; metaphor and symbolism enrich the nuance, though the literary voice flirts with indulgence in places—risking opacity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and original, with clever use of metaphor and tone; moments of overwritten prose slightly dull its edge, but emotional insight is layered and authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A highly cohesive, emotionally intelligent piece with strong stylistic control; not flawless, but quietly powerful in theme and structure with high literary merit.</comment>
