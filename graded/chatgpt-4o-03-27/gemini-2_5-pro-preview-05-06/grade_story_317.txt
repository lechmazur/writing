<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Unit 734’s nostalgia, fearlessness, and drive are clearly established and consistently motivate action; his personality comes through well via voice and reactions, though more dynamic development would deepen emotional impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot arc is tight, coherent, and complete within the word limit; strong cause-effect logic, seamless pacing, and a satisfying conclusion; however, method of resolution edges on predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is robustly rendered through sensory detail—plasteel windows, ozone, humming facility—immersing readers in setting; mood and tone strongly support theme and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative language, well-executed tension, and subtle subtext in nostalgia and betrayal elevate emotional resonance; ending is satisfying though not deeply surprising; prose is tight and occasionally poetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While largely original and thoughtfully crafted, it leans on familiar sci-fi tropes (android saves facility from negligent human leadership); use of language mostly avoids formulaic traps but lacks truly fresh metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, elegant use of all elements, and emotionally grounded stakes; not groundbreaking but refined and resonant with lasting impact; creative synthesis of theme, tone, and action.</comment>
