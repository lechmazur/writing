<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's character is consistent and compelling—his motivation to confront fear grounds the narrative, and his "carefully careless" performance is well executed as a defining trait, though more internal depth or unpredictability would elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story's plot is atmospheric and focused, creating a strong internal arc within the short form; however, the inciting incident (blood drive encounter) is underdeveloped and weakly integrated, slightly reducing coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and eerie, with rich sensory detail and symbolic use of time, plants, and silence; the haunted house feels alive and deeply entwined with the protagonist’s challenge, effectively amplifying tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is haunting and lingers emotionally due to effective symbolism (botanical collection, silence), though the ending could more sharply punctuate the experience with a stronger narrative payoff or revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh and specific imagery avoids cliché and establishes a strong voice, but a few moments (e.g., the mention of the blood drive) feel like mechanical insertions rather than organic story elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story succeeds in tone, cohesion, and atmosphere, with layered tension and clear thematic unity, though one or two assigned elements feel more like scaffolding than integral story bones.</comment>
