<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s personality and motivation are consistently rendered through sensory immersion, ritual, and symbolic tools, creating a vivid, believable figure; minor gains could be made with slightly more tension or evolution in her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within the word count, with solid cause-effect logic; the central action and coded message method are integrated well, though the climax could use more dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, poetic tone, and thematic unity; the story lingers due to its mood and character depth, though the narrative tension remains subtle rather than gripping.</comment>
