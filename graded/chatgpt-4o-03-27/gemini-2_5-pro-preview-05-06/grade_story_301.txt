<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's personality and motivations are deeply intertwined, and his ethically ambiguous actions are portrayed with chilling detachment; his character voice is distinct and consistent, though lacks fuller emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and logical progression from setup to resolution; however, the conflict resolution is subtle to the point of near-ambiguity, which might undercut tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The jazz age time capsule is richly evoked through layered sensory details and complements the surreal tone; the setting amplifies the character's introspective obsession and supports atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is memorable, stylistically assured, and layered with subtext; the final emotional note is ambiguous but fitting, though the choice to "tell" Alistair’s numb detachment slightly weakens immersive depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Language and metaphor are mostly original and purposeful, though a few flourishes verge on ornate; the concept is inventive, though the idea of knitting-as-ritual skirts cliché without fully subverting it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>There's a strong cohesion among elements, and the narrative feels deliberate and reflective; subtlety and ethical ambiguity linger, though sharper emotional stakes could elevate impact further.</comment>
