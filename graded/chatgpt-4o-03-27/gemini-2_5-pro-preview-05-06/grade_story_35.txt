<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is subtly drawn, and her motivation—to understand emotion—is consistently mirrored in her interactions with memory, setting, and object; her restraint and introspection are well-matched to her role, though her internal voice could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure leans toward meditative rather than plot-driven; while coherent and thematically unified, it lacks a definitive arc or external change, limiting its narrative propulsion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and elegantly crafted, with layered metaphors; however, it leans heavily on introspection, which, while intentional, slightly diminishes dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in concept and delivery; avoids formulaic tropes, and metaphors are fresh and integrated; minor lapses into poetic overreach but mostly restrained and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A contemplative, stylistically assured piece with thematic depth and cohesion; though it lacks dramatic stakes, it leaves a strong emotional and intellectual impression.</comment>
