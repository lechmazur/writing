<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is emotionally rooted, aligned with his traits as a restrained, perceptive character; his actions and internal world cohere with his subdued but purpose-driven role, though some of his voice edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and concludes with a quiet resolution consistent with tone and scope; the method of manipulation flows logically, but structure leans more atmospheric than plot-driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive in tone, theme, and image; nearly all elements are meaningfully integrated, delivering a reflective and impactful story despite the constraints.</comment>
