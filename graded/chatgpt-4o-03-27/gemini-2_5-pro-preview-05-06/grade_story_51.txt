<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is nuanced and consistent, with his inner conflict and symbolic attachment to the crate slat conveying depth; however, his voice occasionally veers toward abstraction, diluting immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The arc from intention to confrontation is cohesive and well-paced, though the resolution verges on the idealized, and the silhouette’s identity is left slightly too vague to fully land narratively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and sensory, particularly the charged atmosphere of the static electricity garden, which mirrors Finn’s internal tension and enhances thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphor and symbolism enriches the story's emotional impact and theme; some phrasing strays into the ornamental, but tension and transformation remain effectively grounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While mostly fresh and human in tone, a few phrases ("rationally subjective conviction") feel overly abstract or AI-adjacent, slightly distancing the reader from emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically strong, and emotionally resonant, with a clear arc and powerful central metaphor; minor stylistic excesses and abstraction prevent a higher score.</comment>
