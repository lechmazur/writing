<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rex is sharply drawn, with his vanity, paranoia, and slow transformation rendered with believable nuance; his motivations—clinging to legacy, fear of irrelevance—are convincingly rooted in his past persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc from despair to renewal, with strong cause-and-effect progression; however, the pacing verges on compressed near the midpoint, with the fever and cave discovery slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric—details like the "insect symphony hall" and crystal reflections create a layered, immersive world that mirrors Rex’s internal landscape beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative prose, deft symbolism, and emotional resonance elevate the narrative; some metaphors verge on overwrought, but the themes of legacy, transformation, and humility are effectively rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in tone and concept, with thoughtful language and fresh metaphors; a few florid phrases and slightly formulaic beats dim the overall impression, but it's far from generic or cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, emotional arc, and thematic unity; the story’s elements serve more than they constrain, ending with a lyrical sense of closure and reflection.</comment>
