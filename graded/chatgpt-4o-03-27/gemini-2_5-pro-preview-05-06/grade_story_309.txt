<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corbin's personality is vividly rendered through sharp internal monologue and consistent attributes; his tired cynicism and compulsive pursuit of meaning form a powerful, believable motivation aligned with the narrative tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves narrative cohesion and a satisfying arc in limited space, though the leap from kaleidoscope to villain identification feels slightly rushed and could benefit from a touch more grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Language is largely fresh and purposeful, though a couple of metaphors verge on overuse; overall, strong stylistic consistency and originality distinguish the story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive; the story uses all elements to explore memory, failure, and persistence, offering a lingering, noir-tinged resonance beyond its word count.</comment>
