<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alistair is portrayed with clarity and an intriguingly paradoxical nature; his frenzied yet purposeful behavior aligns well with his motivation, though his emotional interior is lightly sketched rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves strong internal logic and structural cohesion, with a clear arc and an effective build toward a moment of subversive climax; some connective tissue between past and present discoveries feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospherically integral, with sensory descriptions and tone effectively reinforcing the eerie tension and mystery embedded in the narrative's core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphor and subtext elevate the narrative, with the central theme of illusion and perception woven effectively into the prose; the lack of dialogue and limited character interaction slightly reduce emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite a few moments of slightly ornate phrasing, the style avoids tropes, demonstrates narrative originality, and employs a consistent and distinctive voice; the use of metaphor and tone feels deliberate and fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story leaves a resonant impression and feels like a complete narrative despite its brevity; it's cohesive, thematically layered, and creatively constructed, though just short of feeling fully revelatory.</comment>
