<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Alistair’s motivations are rich and internally coherent, with his obsession and spiritual quest clearly informing his behavior; some emotional beats (like the tremor) are slightly on-the-nose, but his voice is distinct and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative effectively maintains a tight focus, but lacks a decisive arc or escalation—more suggestion than progression; the story ends at a plateau rather than a pivot or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is deeply atmospheric and immersive, with sensory detail and symbolism reinforcing theme and mood; the lighthouse, ocean, and string coalesce beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism and introspection are strong, fostering emotional resonance; however, the story skirts full payoff and risk becoming static despite rich craft. The subtext is evocative but leans overly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The writing avoids clichés and uses fresh metaphors, but occasionally drifts toward slightly ornate or overwrought phrasing; emotional nuance is present but could benefit from sharper restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Despite its static external action, the story achieves cohesion and thematic clarity, with strong integration of elements and lingering emotional tone; subdued but impactful.</comment>
