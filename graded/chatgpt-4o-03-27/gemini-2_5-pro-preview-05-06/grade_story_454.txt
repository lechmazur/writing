<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jax's motivations and internal conflict are convincingly rendered, and his recklessness is evident in both action and tone, though his emotional depth could be integrated more dynamically with the plot progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and escalating tension, but the central mission (retrieving the package) is a little underwhelming in payoff relative to the strong buildup of stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly drawn through sensory details and metaphor; the haunted setting and tonal unease enhance the psychological stakes excellently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (clover, funhouse as metaphor), but the ending's emotional beat, while thematically resonant, lacks a slight punch in specificity to be truly haunting or revelatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story avoids formulaic phrasing and feels stylistically intentional, though some transitions verge on overwrought and could be pared back for clarity and pace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between elements and tone; narrative feels complete and conceptually ambitious, with a memorable voice and emotional undercurrent.</comment>
