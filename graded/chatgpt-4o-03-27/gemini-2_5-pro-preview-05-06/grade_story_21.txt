<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael is a distinct character with a clear, obsessive motivation whose demeanor aligns with his grim purpose; his voice is sharp, and his past pain subtly implied, though deeper psychological nuance could enhance him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story maintains a strong internal logic and progression, though the resolution is more thematic than plot-driven; still, it feels deliberate and well-mapped within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric immersion—every sensory detail reinforces the musty decay of the forgotten city hall and Kael’s internal corrosion; drum circles and velvet curtains are used evocatively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic depth with revenge, loss, and obsession interwoven; metaphor, symbolism, and tension are effective, though the ending walks a fine line between ominously suggestive and narratively unfinished.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some moments veer toward overwrought or stylistically rehearsed phrasing, but overall the story is original and avoids formula; emotion is shown through detail and implication rather than stated directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Impressive synthesis of disparate elements into a coherent, moody narrative; the voice, setting, and theme work in tandem, though not flawless, it boldly aims high and often achieves it.</comment>
