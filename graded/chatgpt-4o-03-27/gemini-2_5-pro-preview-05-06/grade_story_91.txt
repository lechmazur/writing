<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is a well-drawn figure with consistent motivations and symbolic traits; his kindness and creative resistance feel true to his character, though more direct emotional stakes could deepen impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is subtle but coherent—there’s a beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the central action (cloud shaping) borders on lyrical abstraction, which may blur narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and immersive; the blending of ghost stories, mechanical sterility, and ephemeral beauty is handled with finesse and strong sensory detailing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quietly powerful with elegant prose and consistent symbolism; the cloud imagery, fedora, and theme of rebellion mesh well, though the emotional payoff is subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story exhibits originality and restraint; while it flirts with tropes (ghosts, secret experiments), it subverts through tone and poetic execution with little sign of machine-like repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and inventive; all elements serve the tone and theme, and the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though resolution is more conceptual than plot-driven.</comment>
