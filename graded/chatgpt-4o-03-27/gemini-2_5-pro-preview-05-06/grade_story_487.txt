<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brutus is vividly drawn, his motivations consistent with his gentle brute archetype, and his calm decisiveness in acquiring the baton reflects his internal logic; the absence of dialogue slightly flattens his voice, but internal consistency remains strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is contained and satisfying, with clear progression—map to baton—though the conflict resolution (plant respect) risks feeling too neat; pacing is mostly well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, with evocative sensory detail (sweating glass, writhing plants, drum beats); the greenhouse setting meaningfully reflects the story’s themes of life, danger, and restraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (life vs. death, myth-making) and poetic contrast (mountain/mouse, tenderness/brutality) add depth while the ending offers thematic resonance; some metaphors verge on overuse but rarely tip into cliché.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels original in tone and execution, with a fresh fusion of gothic and botanical imagery; some elements feel chosen for mood over necessity, but overall, the voice is confident, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, with creative interplay among elements; the story lingers after reading, offering a quietly subversive take on myth and power; polish and ambition are evident throughout.</comment>
