<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure holds well with a strong arc from detour to guardianship, but the rainforest to waiting room transition is abrupt, slightly straining coherence across timeframes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong synergy between elements and theme; the whimsical-yet-sincere tone is carried through with cohesion and a lingering emotional effect.</comment>
