<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict and single-mindedness are well rendered through her actions and reactions; however, her emotional arc remains somewhat underexplored, with limited beats showing human connection or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure moves cleanly from setup to climax with logical cause and effect; the organ's notes unveiling the wall is effective, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt and overly tidy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clich√© and evokes originality, though certain phrasings edge toward ornamental, and some metaphors feel slightly rehearsed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stylish and conceptually rich; the story juggles multiple elements well, though its impact is slightly lessened by a lack of sharper emotional resolution or surprise.</comment>
