<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias is richly drawn—his surly demeanor convincingly masks an obsessive, vulnerable core, and his motivation aligns with his method and voice throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story offers emotional and thematic resolution, but lacks a strong narrative arc or action-based progression—a contemplative vignette more than a plot-driven piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting and atmosphere are vividly immersive and deeply tied to the character's inner world; sensory details and tone work in elegant harmony.</comment>
