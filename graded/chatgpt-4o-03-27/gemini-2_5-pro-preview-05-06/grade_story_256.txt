<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair’s motivation is deeply entwined with his character arc; his quiet rebellion is compelling and aligns well with his loyally disloyal nature, though his emotional depth could be enhanced in dialogue or internal thought for even more resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot lacks traditional resolution but achieves a clear arc through repetition and ritual; however, it risks stagnation as the action remains largely static with minimal change or escalation across the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with lush metaphors and a dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly embodies the “soft edges of time,” enhancing both tone and theme substantially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The metaphor of worship through measurement is striking and original, and the central conflict is thematically rich, though some symbolism borders on overwrought and could be more grounded to heighten emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates aesthetic intent, but occasionally strays into florid, AI-adjacent phrasing that weakens authenticity; repetition of metaphoric language borders on indulgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and effectively integrates its elements into a thematically unified whole; the lingering emotional tone and philosophical yearning elevate it, though momentum is more ambient than dynamic.</comment>
