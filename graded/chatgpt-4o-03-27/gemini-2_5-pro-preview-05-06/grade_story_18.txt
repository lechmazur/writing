<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Alabaster’s motivation to uncover truth is clearly articulated and consistent, and his method of influence is tied to his nature. However, character depth remains somewhat static—his emotional range is largely implied, not explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arc—observation, intervention, spark of change—is cohesive and well-paced. The reveal of the council's corruption and the symbolic act through the calligrapher builds effectively, though the resolution leans abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is immersive, and the oppressive, soot-choked atmosphere strongly supports the themes and tone. Excellent sensory detail grounds the mood and supports the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, using symbols and subtle subtext to powerful effect. The idea of truth rising through art is well-executed, though the climax could offer slightly more dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is often elegant and original, with some striking metaphors. However, a few lines verge on being overly ornate or abstract. Emotional beats are suggested more than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story feels artistically whole within its constraint, with most elements integrated seamlessly. It lingers beyond its final line, though greater emotional texture could elevate its impact further.</comment>
