<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alistair is believably fainthearted yet driven, and his fear versus curiosity conflict anchors his choices well; however, he could benefit from more nuance or personal history to deepen his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The progression from fear to potential revelation is cohesive and well-paced; the ruler-triggered tapestry shift provides both plot turn and climax, but the resolution feels slightly open-ended without stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is richly atmospheric with sensory detail, and the chamber feels alive with secrecy and dread; the illusion motif is well-integrated into the shifting visuals and environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering, especially with the ruler as both literal and symbolic key; emotional resonance is present though dialogue or interpersonal stakes could enhance depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally fresh and inventive, particularly in object use and method; a few moments verge on overwritten or emotionally flattened by abstraction, slightly dulling originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and elegantly constructed around its central metaphor; it leaves lingering curiosity and emotional tone, though lacks a truly surprising twist or complexity of theme.</comment>
