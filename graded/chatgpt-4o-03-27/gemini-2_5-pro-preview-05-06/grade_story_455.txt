<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s character is well-articulated through his ritualistic actions, quiet defiance against legacy, and calm demeanor masking deep scars — a strong internal consistency in voice and motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is tightly constructed, with a slow build toward a shadow-based confirmation scene that acts as both plot climax and resolution; elegant pacing and logical integration of espionage mechanics support coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is thick, immersive, layered with sensory detail and symbolic weight; the mossy well, metallic scent, and shadowplay all reinforce tone and tension beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative prose, layered subtext about legacy and silence; however, the emotional tension is more cerebral than visceral, slightly reducing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly original in approach—shadow-reading and coin symbolism are fresh—but a few phrases veer toward overly ornate or slightly affected language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and deeply atmospheric; all elements serve the theme of inherited duty, though the ending resolves more in tone than plot.</comment>
