<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alistair's psychological arc is thoughtfully explored—transitioning from passive-aggressive destruction to peace-seeking insight aligns with his poetic, insomniac temperament—but his voice could be more distinct and embodied in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative has a satisfying introspective arc shaped by internal transformation, but the middle is slightly foggy in pacing and cause-effect clarity, especially the leap from whispers to non-violence epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic and surrounding details are highly atmospheric and symbolic, blending decay and growth to support tone and theme; strong imagery immerses the reader effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story evokes contemplation with layered metaphors and symbolic use of setting and objects; the poetic tone supports its message, though resolution feels slightly more told than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, a compellingly odd protagonist, and subverted ghost tropes elevate the story; a few moments shimmer with originality, though some transitions verge on overwrought or imprecise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme, language, and structure cohere well, especially with the symbolic framing of peace as quiet cultivation; slight pacing unevenness prevents full impact.</comment>
