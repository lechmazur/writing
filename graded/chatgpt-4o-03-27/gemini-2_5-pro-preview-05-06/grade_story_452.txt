<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s softheartedness is powerfully conveyed through subtle yet compelling actions; his motivation is both clear and emotionally resonant, though internal conflict or tension could be deepened slightly for maximal complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and self-contained, with a logical progression from mission to result; however, the climax could benefit from greater narrative tension or complication to heighten impact.</comment>
