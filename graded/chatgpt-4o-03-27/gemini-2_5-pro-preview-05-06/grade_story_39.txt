<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is convincingly restless, driven, and his motivations align well with his actions; his subtle acts of rebellion feel authentic, though some emotional depth is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot builds steadily with logical cause-effect structure and satisfying arc, but the climax remains implied rather than felt—resolution is thematic, not event-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Mars biodome is vividly imagined with sensory detail and symbolic tension; the oppressive atmosphere enhances Elias's quiet revolt and mirrors his inner unrest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lantern, bookshop), layered meaning, and emotional resonance; however, voice lacks distinctive rhythm that would elevate its memorability significantly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Style is mostly original with thoughtful metaphors, but some phrasing (“sculpt a new tomorrow,” “cautious abandon”) leans into poetic cliché, slightly blunting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive and tightly cohesive fusion of theme, setting, and tone; slightly weakened by lack of a sharp narrative pivot or twist that would lift it above excellent into unforgettable.</comment>
