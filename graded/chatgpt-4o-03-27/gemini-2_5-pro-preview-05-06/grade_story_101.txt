<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is symbolically strong—a "weathered heart" seeking transformation—but lacks clear individuality or narrative specificity; the arc is evocative but abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc—arrival, revelation, departure—but relies on metaphor more than plot causality; the pacing is smooth but not anchored in concrete events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive and thematically rich piece; abstract yet emotionally impactful with distinctive voice and execution beyond mechanical assembly of prompts.</comment>
