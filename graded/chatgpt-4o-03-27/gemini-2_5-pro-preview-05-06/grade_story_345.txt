<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s internal conflict is vivid and compelling, shaped by his past as a priest and the metaphor of the abacus; motivation is clear and consistent, though could benefit from greater nuance in emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Plot progression is more atmospheric than event-driven; while there's a sense of movement, the arc is subtle and resolution is implied rather than explicit—slightly hindering structural completeness.</comment>
