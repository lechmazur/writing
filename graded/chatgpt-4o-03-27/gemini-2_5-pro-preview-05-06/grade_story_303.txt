<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's grief, her scientific motivation, and her emotional transformation are clearly portrayed and internally consistent; her development is subtle but meaningful within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a narrative arc with a beginning (Elara's mourning), middle (meeting Lyra), and end (emotional reprieve); some transitions feel slightly too smooth, missing a beat of tension or escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Surreal yet grounded, the story demonstrates a distinctive voice and imagery; a few phrase repetitions slightly undercut the originality, but overall it feels human and artistically composed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and emotionally layered, the story handles many elements deftly without feeling mechanical; its quiet tone and subtle arc linger beyond the text.</comment>
