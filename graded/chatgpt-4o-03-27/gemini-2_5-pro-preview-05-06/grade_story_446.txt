<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn with a compelling internal contradiction (amiability masking deep purpose), and his motivation to restore Eldoria is consistently reflected in his actions, though his emotional depth could use more specific, grounded nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot has a lyrical arc, but the shift from metaphorical to literal hydrolysis feels sudden; still, the progression from charity drive to revelation is mostly logical and well-paced.</comment>
