<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s character is consistent and distinctive—her minimalist, quiet defiance is convincingly rendered through her rituals and final act; however, her emotional interior could be more richly illuminated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight and purposeful with strong cause-and-effect logic and a satisfying arc; the final twist is understated yet powerful, but the resolution skirts ambiguity that could have been further developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and artificiality; figurative language is fresh and understated, and the premise is imaginative—though the emotional dimension remains almost too subdued at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive and resonant narrative that blends speculative thought with emotional subtext; it balances brevity and depth well, though a sliver more character reflection could elevate it fully.</comment>
