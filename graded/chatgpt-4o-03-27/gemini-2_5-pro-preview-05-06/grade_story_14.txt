<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Finn’s naivety and gambler’s spirit are consistently and convincingly portrayed, with his obsessive belief in the candle mold and his desperate pursuit of the spark revealing his essence; however, further depth into his past could elevate the emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains strong internal logic and a complete arc within the word limit; the progression from anticipation to climax to resolution is well-paced, though the final beat could carry more narrative consequence beyond the symbolic win.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with tactile and auditory details immersing the reader in the eerie, decaying station—its unpredictability paralleling Finn’s gamble and heightening thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is strong, with effective symbolic imagery (the captured star, the silence, the light), though some metaphors verge on overwrought; nonetheless, the narrative arc delivers a poignant, memorable payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is largely original in tone and execution, especially in blending mystical elements with industrial decay; a few overworked phrases and expected beats slightly dull its edge of surprise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s components cohere into a singular vision, with thematic clarity and emotional weight; its brevity feels purposeful, though minor refinement in phrasing would push it to peak polish.</comment>
