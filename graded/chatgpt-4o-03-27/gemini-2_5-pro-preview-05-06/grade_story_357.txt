<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and resolved within the word limit, with the invitation and game serving as effective catalysts; however, some transitions feel slightly expository, softening the momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong interplay of elements with a clear arc and emotional impact; the narrative lingers after reading, though tighter sensory anchoring would elevate it further.</comment>
