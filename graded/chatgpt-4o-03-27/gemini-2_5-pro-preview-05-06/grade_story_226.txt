<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is richly drawn through consistent imagery and action—his obsession with preserving lullabies and the tenderness with which he handles the skull reveals deep internal motivation, though his emotional arc remains mostly static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative progresses coherently from setup to resolution, organically shaped by Elias’s work; however, tension and stakes are understated, sacrificing some narrative urgency for atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly immersive—dust, sound decay, spectral resonance all build a haunting atmosphere that perfectly complements the character’s mission and emotional tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Deeply evocative prose with strong symbolic layers; the story prompts reflection on memory and loss, but risks tipping into overwrought at times, slightly muting its emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and hauntingly specific imagery elevate the narrative above formula; while ornate, the language mostly serves the tone rather than detracting from it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels intentional and cohesively constructed around its elements, with a lyrical tone and philosophical depth that lingers—exceptionally close to publishable with slight tightening.</comment>
