<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is convincingly drawn; his authoritarian rigidity, internal conflict, and eventual shift are credible and layered, though moments of realization come slightly too quickly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and complete—beginning with insulated control, climaxing in confrontation, and resolving in a quiet pivot—but the Grove’s sudden reappearance strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly drawn, with evocative seasonal and atmospheric detail enhancing both mood and theme; the enclave’s insularity is felt throughout without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story resonates emotionally and thematically; symbolism (seeds, frost, growth) is elegantly deployed, and Elias’ pivot is subtly rendered, though slightly more ambiguity might deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the metaphorical import of the seeds and mood, though a few phrases toe the line of poetic excess; emotional nuance is strong but edges toward overt at moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and quietly powerful, the story lingers with a strong thematic impression and effective symbolic throughline; it feels deliberate and largely free from contrivance.</comment>
