<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, and her internal yearning to understand her past is clearly linked to her compassionate and mystical traits; however, her voice lacks unique emotional depth and idiosyncratic expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arc is complete and connects well from beginning to end, but the stakes and cause-effect relationships are sometimes rushed, and the submarine method feels slightly shoehorned into the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative effort with thoughtful theme integration and a clear conclusion, though weakened slightly by some clunky narrative mechanics and an overly literal method.</comment>
