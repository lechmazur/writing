<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's character is emotionally rich and internally consistent; his motivation aligns clearly with his gentle, almost broken demeanor, though the "cult leader" role is underplayed in behavior and authority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The emotional arc is satisfying, but the plot is more meditative than action-driven; there's minimal progression outside the central moment with the sunflower, making the structure feel static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and sensory imagery create a powerfully immersive and melancholic atmosphere that deeply supports theme and character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poetic and symbol-rich with strong emotional tone and subtext; however, the narrative leans toward mood over tangible stakes, reducing impact slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original concepts and vivid metaphorical layering elevate this beyond typical genre tropes; the prose is occasionally ornate but rarely distracts from meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion of concept and tone; the story leaves a lingering impression but lacks the narrative propulsion or structural boldness to reach top-tier placement.</comment>
