<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alistair Finch is vividly drawn and consistently motivated by his obsession, with quirks that reinforce his madness and comically serious personality; his interplay with Audrey III subtly enriches his character, though deeper emotional complexity is lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and coherent within the word limit, with a defined beginning, escalation, and humorous setback; however, the climax’s disruption feels abrupt and the resolution slightly too reliant on a reset for future attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, unique premise, and consistent tone elevate it beyond trope-driven writing; slightly exaggerated language is in service of the eccentric style, and the quirks feel organic rather than formulaic.</comment>
