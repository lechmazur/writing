<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The symbolic use of the lava lamps and playing card is striking, and the ending offers quiet emotional resolution, but the prose occasionally leans into overstatement, softening its overall impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with strong emotional resonance and satisfying use of all elements, though its quietness risks underwhelming in a competitive field demanding more tension or surprise.</comment>
