<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story manages a full narrative arc within tight constraints, with a well-executed beginning, middle, and end. Cause-and-effect are mostly logical, though the connection sparked by the power outage could be more realistically grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive, rich with sensory detail and mood. The setting of the tree ring reading room works symbolically and physically to enhance the theme and character arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional imagery and metaphor support a resonant theme of defiant self-expression through art. Subtext and symbolism are layered and purposeful, though the emotional climax leans slightly toward abstraction over depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original voice and imagery with inventive combinations of elements. Some phrasing flirts with over-ornamentation, and a few metaphors repeat similar tones, reducing impact slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Creatively woven elements serve the narrative rather than overwhelm it. Though slightly heavy on lyrical abstraction, the story lingers in the reader’s mind and demonstrates literary ambition and cohesion.</comment>
