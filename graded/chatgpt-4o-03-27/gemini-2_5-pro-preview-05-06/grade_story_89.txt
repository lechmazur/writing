<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's personality, spirituality, and motivation are vividly integrated; his zealous worldview and reverence for ancestral prophecy drive the action logically. However, he lacks dynamic growth or complexity beyond his mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative moves with deliberate pacing, and the plot flows logically to a symbolic climax. Still, the resolution—finding the nail as the turning point—feels more metaphorical than narratively earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is striking and symbolic; the celestial and meteorological imagery deeply enrich the atmosphere, aligning well with Kael’s mystical perception. Sensory detail is sparse but effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically resonant, and stylistically controlled. Its originality and conceptual unity carry it, despite a slight lack of nuanced conflict or grounded interpersonal stakes.</comment>
