<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh ideas and clever element integration distinguish this story; a few phrases verge on overwritten, but overall language is purposeful and avoids clichés.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive and layered, the story feels cohesive and thoughtful, though the ending’s quiet triumph may benefit from a slightly sharper narrative punctuation or final image.</comment>
