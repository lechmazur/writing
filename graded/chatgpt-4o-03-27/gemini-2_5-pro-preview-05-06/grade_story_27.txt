<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair’s personality is richly delineated through his curse and behavior; his polite vindictiveness and commitment to truth shape each interaction and reveal intent. Silas is thinner by comparison but functional as a foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc holds cohesively, with a clear beginning, build-up, and ominous resolution. The pacing is tight and purposeful, though slightly predictable in its consequence for Silas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is striking and immersive—the haunted, decaying amusement park and bird watching add vivid texture. Atmospheric details support tone and thematic undercurrent effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evokes unease and quiet dread with subtlety. Symbolism in the pencil box and metaphor in the park’s judgment enrich the tale, and the final line lingers, though some moments veer toward telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Displays originality in blending curse, ethics, and atmosphere. A few phrases flirt with over-formality or poetic excess, but voice remains distinct and mostly controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A refined and compelling short piece with thematic depth and stylistic unity; nearly publishable as-is, with only minor refinements needed for greater subtlety and balance.</comment>
