<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Silas has a consistent voice and arc, but his shift from reluctant pawn to key-turner lacks sufficient emotional evolution; his transformation feels externally driven rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and structurally sound, with an effective twist resolution, though the process of "silencing" the prophecy is conceptually muddy and underexplained in execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and immersive, with strong sensory details and thematic resonance; the room itself acts almost as a character, enhancing the surreal, prophetic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The twist redefines earlier events and gives the story depth; rich metaphor and symbolism are used effectively, though some emotions are told rather than shown, limiting full impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inventive premise with poetic turns of phrase, but occasionally leans into abstract vagueness; while original, some lines veer close to purple prose or slightly diffuse metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive and thematically resonant piece with strong atmosphere and character framing, though some elements feel more decorative than essential, slightly softening its narrative urgency.</comment>
