<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's introversion, dancer’s grace, and mental discipline are all woven effectively into her rituals and motivations; her knitting and interpretation of charts clearly stem from her personality, though a touch more dialogue or vivid emotional contrast could deepen her distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The throughline of knitting a star map to escape is conceptually sound and thematically resolved, but the plot remains somewhat static; a slightly stronger sense of conflict or narrative shift would enhance momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and immersive, with rich sensory detail and mood consistent with Elara’s inner world; the cipher office and wasteland contrast is striking and effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story balances metaphor and subtext with elegant prose, and the act of knitting becomes a layered metaphor for defiance and hope; however, the emotional arc plateaus slightly without a sharper turning point.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking originality in weaving knitting and astronomy into a survival method; avoids cliché and maintains a consistent, poetic tone without excess ornamentation; slightly abstract at moments but consistently human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive in tone, theme, and imagery, with a clear internal logic; the layered use of elements supports the whole, though a hint more dynamic tension would elevate it further.</comment>
