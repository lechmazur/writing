<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orrin’s detachment is consistently portrayed through his brewing, coded songs, and emotional restraint; his motivation to escape is clear and aligns with his actions, though deeper emotional nuance could elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc from preparation to escape; the action flows logically, and the climax at the crossroads is satisfying, though some transitions verge on poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism (e.g., lullabies as code, beer as rebellion) create emotional and thematic depth; the ending resonates, though a touch more clarity in subtext would enhance impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the story organically; the brevity feels intentional, not limiting, and the narrative lingers with thematic weight and stylistic cohesion.</comment>
