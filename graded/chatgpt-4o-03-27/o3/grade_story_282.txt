<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tildaâ€™s motivation is clear, consistent, and deeply tied to her identity as both blacksmith and nostalgic rebel; her actions align with her traits, though her emotional depth could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the method of sound-based spectacle is inventive and logically escalates from her motivation, though the climax borders on implausible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with multisensory detail; the dusty atrium and closing-time hush create a unique, immersive atmosphere that enhances both tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (dust, nautilus, war medal); the story evokes wonder and nostalgia, though the emotional stakes could be slightly more grounded for greater impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution; metaphors are fresh, and the tone is consistent, though a few flourishes verge on ornate, risking slight over-stylization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; the story feels complete and leaves a lasting impression, though a touch more emotional realism would elevate it further.</comment>
