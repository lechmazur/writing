<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly drawn with consistent cowardice and self-interest, and his arc—though subtle—feels earned; Thale adds depth as a foil, though both remain more archetypal than fully human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and elegantly structured within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution; the journey through the projection is imaginative and logically follows the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is richly atmospheric, with evocative sensory details and surreal imagery that enhance tone and theme; the setting feels integral rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, especially the key and globe; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though some moments verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; a few phrases flirt with purple prose but mostly serve the tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and layered for its length, with a resonant theme and imaginative use of all elements; minor clarity issues prevent a perfect score.</comment>
