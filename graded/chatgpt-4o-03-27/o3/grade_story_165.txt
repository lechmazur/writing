<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s motivations are clear, emotionally resonant, and consistent with his gentle nature; his actions—using reversed messages, offering a petal—align with his personality, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the use of mirrored messages and the contest are inventive and coherent, though the pacing slightly compresses emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined with vivid sensory detail—quartz stairs, emberlight, and the butterfly’s refracted colors create a strong atmosphere that enhances theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism (e.g., butterfly, helm, petal) elevate the narrative; the ending is emotionally powerful and thematically resonant, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution; metaphors are fresh, and emotional nuance is shown rather than told—though a few phrases verge on ornate, they serve the tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; the story feels complete and lingers in the mind, with all elements serving a unified emotional and thematic purpose.</comment>
