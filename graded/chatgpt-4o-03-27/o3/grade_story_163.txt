<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s motivation is clear and consistent, her actions align with her bitter optimism, and her emotional connection to the parking stub deepens her character; however, her voice could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and resolution; the detour and unification sequence are logical within the story’s surreal framework, though the traffic jam setup feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world is vividly imagined with layered sensory detail—migrating clouds, colossal organisms, and gravitational eddies create a rich, immersive atmosphere that supports the story’s tone and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism, and a resonant theme of transformation elevate the narrative; the ending is both satisfying and suggestive of further depth, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique blend of science fiction and poetic surrealism; minor moments of abstraction slightly dilute emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative, with all elements serving the narrative’s emotional and thematic arc; the story lingers in the mind, though a few transitions could be smoother.</comment>
