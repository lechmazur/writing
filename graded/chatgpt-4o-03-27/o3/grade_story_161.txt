<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct, their motivations are deeply rooted in personal tragedy, and their actions—methodical, symbolic, and quietly vengeful—align with their traits as a punctual, observant orchardist. The character is vividly rendered through metaphor and tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc from investigation to exposure to resolution.

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospherically surreal, with sensory details (burnt apple groves, folded cardstock, drifting rumors) enhancing mood and theme. The juxtaposition of orchard and aerospace is original and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is layered with metaphor, symbolism, and emotional resonance.
