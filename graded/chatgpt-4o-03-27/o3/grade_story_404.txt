<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thalen and Mirva are distinct, with motivations that align with their actions; the monk’s quiet resolve and Mirva’s guarded pragmatism are well-rendered, though more internal conflict or evolution would elevate them further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the pacing is tight but effective, though the climax could benefit from slightly more tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the shop, comet, and cosmic mechanics all enhance the tone and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative prose, layered symbolism, and emotional resonance elevate the story; the comet as a metaphor for fractured hope is particularly strong, though a touch more subtextual ambiguity would deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and specific imagery avoid cliché; the tone is consistent and voice distinct, though a few phrases verge on ornate and could be pared for clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative; the elements feel integral rather than imposed, and the story lingers with emotional and thematic weight beyond its length.</comment>
