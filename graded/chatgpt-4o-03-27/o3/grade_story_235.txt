<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Isamu is rendered with quiet depth; his motivations are subtle yet consistent, and his actions—particularly the silent interventions—reveal a layered personality. Aya’s arc is also delicately handled, though other students remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional climax and resolution. Some transitions are poetic to the point of slight obscurity, but overall coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is exquisitely rendered—sensory, atmospheric, and thematically resonant. The castle, rain, and meteor showers all serve the tone and character motivations seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, strong symbolism, and emotional subtext elevate the narrative. The story shows rather than tells, and the final image lingers. Slight risk of over-poeticism in places, but overall highly effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice. Avoids cliché and formula, though a few phrases verge on ornate. Emotional nuance is handled with restraint and specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant. The brevity feels intentional, not limiting. All elements serve the story’s theme of unspoken connection and transformation through art and nature.</comment>
