<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellory’s characterization is vivid and consistent—his aimlessness, reverence for mystery, and symbolic gestures (e.g., cradling the coffin fragment) all reinforce his arc; however, his internal conflict could be more emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within tight constraints, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the riddle and mirror method drive the plot logically, though the sacrifice of certainty is more abstract than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of arctic greenhouse and mystical intrusion is masterfully atmospheric; sensory details (lotus, ozone, condensation) are immersive and thematically resonant with the story’s surreal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor and symbolism, the story evokes wonder and quiet awe; the ending is poetic and thematically satisfying, though the emotional stakes remain more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution; metaphors are fresh, and the tone is consistent; a few phrases verge on ornate, but overall the prose is purposeful and avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and imaginative; the elements feel organically integrated, and the story lingers with a sense of mythic resonance and quiet transformation.</comment>
