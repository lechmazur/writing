<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is distinct and consistent, with motivations—coaxing thunder, preserving dreams—clearly rooted in their fractured identity and guilt; however, emotional depth could be more varied beyond obsession and regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the symbolic climax (the thunderclap) is earned, though some transitions verge on abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with vivid sensory detail and metaphorical resonance; the treehouse-library and ash-colored sky enhance the surreal, post-human atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., photo sphere, scoreboard), with a resonant emotional payoff; the story lingers in the mind, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original voice and concept; metaphors are fresh and specific, though a few phrases flirt with purple prose; emotional nuance is strong, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and emotionally resonant; the story feels complete and purposeful, with layered meaning and a haunting final image that elevates the whole.</comment>
