<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maelion and Tilda are distinct, their motivations clear and consistent; Maelion’s suspicion and Tilda’s restrained curiosity mirror each other effectively, though more dialogue or internal conflict could deepen them further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and resolution; the action flows logically from the machine’s failure to the guild’s transformation, though the climax resolves slightly too smoothly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the atmosphere of soot and invention perfectly supports the theme and character motivations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; the story feels complete and lingers emotionally, with all elements serving the narrative rather than dictating it.</comment>
