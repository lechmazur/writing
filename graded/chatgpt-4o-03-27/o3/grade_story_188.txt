<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hideki's motivations are deeply rooted in past trauma and guilt, and his actions—seeking broken pieces, responding to Masa's plea—are consistent and emotionally resonant; Masa is less developed but still effective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally satisfying resolution; pacing is deliberate and coherent, though the climax resolves slightly too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory detail (rain, moss, frogs, terraces) enhancing tone and theme; the castle and rice fields are deeply integrated into character and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative prose, layered symbolism (armor poems, rice seeds), and a powerful emotional arc elevate the story; the ending is poetic and thematically resonant without being overly sentimental.</comment>
