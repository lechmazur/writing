<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anselm’s motivations are poetically rendered and consistent, with his empirically rebellious nature driving both his actions and symbolic gestures; however, his internal voice remains somewhat abstracted, limiting emotional intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resonant end; the logic-myth tension is well-paced, though transitions between metaphysical and literal moments occasionally blur coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sound garden is vividly imagined with multisensory detail—harp-trees, bronze chimes, and chalk-dusted dawns create a lush, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story’s thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism elevate the narrative; the fusion of logic and folklore is both intellectually and emotionally compelling, though the lack of dialogue slightly limits tonal variation.</comment>
