<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant end; the symbolic progression through the five flights is elegant and purposeful, though some transitions are slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive, with vivid sensory detail and a haunting atmosphere that perfectly supports the tone and themes; the lighthouse prison and reef are integral to the story’s emotional and narrative weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism, especially the knocker and mirrored self; the story evokes deep emotion and reflection, though the density of imagery occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>
