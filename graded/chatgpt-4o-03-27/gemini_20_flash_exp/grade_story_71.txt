<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas is a compelling figure with a clear motivation rooted in his oath, and his actions—particularly the severing of the fan—align with his role as guardian; however, his emotional arc remains somewhat static, limiting deeper development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the action of severing the fan is well-motivated and logically executed, though the pacing could benefit from slightly more buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, with strong sensory and symbolic detail—the fossilized giant and bruised sky enhance the surreal, melancholic tone and reinforce the story’s liminal atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and subtext, with a haunting tone and layered symbolism; while emotionally restrained, it evokes reflection on duty and isolation, though the ending could carry a slightly stronger emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique protagonist; avoids clichés and formulaic structure, though a few phrases verge on ornate, they serve the tone rather than detract from it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and imaginative integration of elements; the story feels complete and deliberate, with a lingering emotional and thematic resonance that elevates it beyond its brief length.</comment>
