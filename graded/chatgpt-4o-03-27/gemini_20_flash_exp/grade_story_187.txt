<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Silas is clearly motivated and consistent, with his stoicism and archival purpose well-aligned, but his emotional depth and internal conflict could be more fully realized to elevate him beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and the action of "imposing" feels more symbolic than plot-driving, limiting narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with a clear theme and purpose, but lacks the narrative risk or emotional punch needed for top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
