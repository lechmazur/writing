<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marco’s internal conflict is clear and his motivation aligns with his past, but the “apologetic thug” persona is more told than shown, and his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly static and the museum method is underdeveloped, weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but the prose occasionally veers into generic introspection and lacks the specificity and unpredictability of truly original voice or imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, but its impact is dulled by over-reliance on internal monologue and underdeveloped use of key elements like setting and method.</comment>
