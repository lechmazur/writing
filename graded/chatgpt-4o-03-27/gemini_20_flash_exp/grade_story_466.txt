<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alistair is intriguing and distinct, with a clear voice and consistent motivation, but his moral ambiguity is more told than shown, and his emotional depth remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a compelling arc and internal logic, but the transition from supermarket to tower feels abrupt, and the resolution lacks a strong sense of narrative payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly rendered with strong sensory detail; the setting enhances the tone and theme, though the connection between the supermarket and tower could be more organically bridged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is evocative and stylistically confident, with strong imagery and metaphor, but lacks a clear emotional climax or conflict resolution to fully satisfy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing borders on ornate, and while the concept is fresh, the execution occasionally leans into abstraction over specificity, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, with a strong thematic throughline, but it stops short of delivering a truly profound or surprising insight.</comment>
