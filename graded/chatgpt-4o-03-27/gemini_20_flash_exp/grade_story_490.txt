<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas is vividly rendered with a compelling contradiction—his "enthusiastic apathy" and "methodically random" behavior feel paradoxical yet believable; his motivation to cradle the unknown is abstract but consistent and thematically resonant.</comment>
