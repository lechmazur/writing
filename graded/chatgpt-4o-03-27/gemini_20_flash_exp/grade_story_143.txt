<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn with consistent traits—her fidgetiness, lack of musical talent, and mage-smith identity all inform her actions and emotional arc; however, her internal conflict could be deepened further for maximal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the method of remaking via chalkboard is coherent, though the pacing slightly lingers in the middle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the story feels complete and purposeful, with creative integration of elements and a lingering sense of hope amid entropy.</comment>
