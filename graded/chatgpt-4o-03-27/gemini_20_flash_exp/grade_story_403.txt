<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelan’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his yearning for perceptual escape is well-aligned with his actions, but the “deeply superficial” trait is underexplored and feels more like a label than a lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a lingering emotional resonance, though a few elements feel more decorative than essential.</comment>
