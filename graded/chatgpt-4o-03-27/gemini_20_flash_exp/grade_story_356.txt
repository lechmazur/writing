<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hemlock is vividly drawn with consistent traits—his aloofness, weariness, and quiet introspection are well-aligned with his actions and motivations; however, his emotional arc remains static, limiting deeper development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the mechanism of vanishing via cloud paths strains plausibility even within speculative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and tonally rich, with strong sensory details (chalk, ozone, hum of engines) that enhance the mood and setting; the space pirate ship feels lived-in and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story evokes melancholy and wonder, with elegant prose and metaphor; the ending is poignant, though the central conflict is more philosophical than dramatic, which may limit emotional urgency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with strong stylistic control and emotional resonance; a few elements feel ornamental rather than essential, slightly weakening overall impact.</comment>
