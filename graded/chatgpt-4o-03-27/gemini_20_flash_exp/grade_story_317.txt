<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unit 734 is distinct and his motivations are consistent, but his emotional arc lacks depth and evolution; his "nostalgic" and "anxiously fearless" traits are more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the stakes could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the levitation facility and dawn light enhance the tone and tension effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., crystals, telescope), but emotional resonance is muted and the prose occasionally leans toward exposition over immersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the crystal method and android's internal conflict, but the narrative leans on familiar sci-fi tropes and lacks a truly surprising twist or subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Well-structured and thematically coherent, with thoughtful integration of elements, but lacks the emotional or philosophical depth to elevate it to top-tier literary status.</comment>
