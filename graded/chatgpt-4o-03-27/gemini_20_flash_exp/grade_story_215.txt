<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Father Michael is a compelling character with a clear internal conflict between faith and reason; his motivation is consistent and nuanced, though his "inwardly social" trait is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and progression through the puzzles, but the resolution feels more like a transition than a true climax or conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory contrasts (e.g., dance music vs. cold hidden room), enhancing mood and theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (mirrors, reflections), with a resonant theme of bridging science and the spiritual; ending is evocative but slightly open-ended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing borders on ornate, and a few metaphors feel familiar, but overall the story avoids clich√© and shows originality in concept and execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a strong thematic throughline; the story feels deliberate and thoughtful, though not quite transcendent.</comment>
