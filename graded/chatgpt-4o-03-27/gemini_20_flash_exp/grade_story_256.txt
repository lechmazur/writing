<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Silas has a compelling internal conflict and a clear motivation, but his emotional depth is more told than shown, and his "kindly" nature is not meaningfully demonstrated beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a consistent arc and mood, but lacks a strong narrative progression or resolution; the action is more symbolic than plot-driving, which limits structural impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with imaginative use of elements, but lacks the narrative sharpness and emotional subtlety required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
