<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clearly aligned with her actions and beliefs, and her voice is distinct and consistent; however, secondary characters like Finn are underdeveloped and serve more as foils than fully realized individuals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and maintains coherence within the word limit, with a strong sense of progression from fear to resolve; however, the climax lacks a tangible turning point or external conflict to heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and a tone that enhances the themes of secrecy and resistance; the haunted passage and stormy intervals are evocative and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story effectively uses metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the torn sticky note as fragmented knowledge), and the emotional arc is compelling, though the resolution leans slightly on exposition rather than action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrasing borders on overly poetic or abstract, and the emotional nuance occasionally veers into the declarative rather than the experiential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with a strong emotional throughline and creative use of elements; it leaves a lingering sense of purpose, though it could benefit from more narrative tension or surprise.</comment>
