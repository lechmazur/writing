<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara is well-drawn with a clear internal conflict and a believable arc; her transformation is subtle but meaningful, though her "sapped" state could be more dynamically shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc and thematic resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, with the goose's role feeling a bit sudden in its symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory and ocean setting are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the mood and theme, enhancing the introspective tone and Elaraâ€™s isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thoughtful, cohesive, and thematically rich; the story lingers after reading, though a touch more narrative tension would elevate it further.</comment>
