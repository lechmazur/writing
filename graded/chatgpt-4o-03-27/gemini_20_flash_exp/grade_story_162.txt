<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Finn’s motivation is clearly tied to his past and the blueprint, but his transformation from carefree gambler to determined seeker feels abrupt and underdeveloped; the “trustworthy” trait is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a clear emotional throughline, but the plot lacks dynamic progression—most of the action is internal, and the pacing flattens as a result.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, with strong sensory details like the scent of solder and the hush of videotapes; the setting supports the mood and theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story uses metaphor and symbolism well, especially with the blueprint as a map to the past, but it leans heavily on exposition and lacks dramatic tension or emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels overly ornate or generic (“sun-drenched beaches,” “shared secret”), and the emotional beats are often told rather than shown, reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but it doesn’t fully capitalize on its potential for emotional depth or narrative surprise; it feels more like a prologue than a complete story.</comment>
