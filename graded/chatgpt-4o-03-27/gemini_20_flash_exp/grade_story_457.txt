<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas is a well-drawn character with a clear internal logic; his motivations align with his actions, and his symbolic use of the zipper pull deepens his portrayal, though his emotional arc remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, though the pacing slightly lags in the middle due to introspective repetition.</comment>
