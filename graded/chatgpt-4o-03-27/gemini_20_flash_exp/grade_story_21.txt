<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Silas’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions align with his quest for revenge, but his personality as a "measured diplomat" is underdeveloped and largely irrelevant to his behavior in the story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with strong sensory details (especially smell), and the mood supports the character’s grim mission, though some elements (like the drum circles) feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically focused, with effective symbolism (tassel, must), but lacks subtlety in its delivery and could benefit from more layered subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and setting, but the prose occasionally veers into formulaic phrasing and overwrought description, weakening the story’s distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative use of elements, but the character’s role and tone feel mismatched, and the writing lacks the polish of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
