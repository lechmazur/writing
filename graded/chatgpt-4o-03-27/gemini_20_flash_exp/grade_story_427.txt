<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theron’s motivations are clearly tied to his philosophical nature and dream-weaving ability, but Silas remains underdeveloped, and Theron’s emotional arc, while present, lacks deeper nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed near the climax, and the transition from confrontation to revelation is abrupt.</comment>
