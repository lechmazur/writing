<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is refreshingly nontraditional—empathy over power—but her emotional arc feels underdeveloped; we glimpse her resolve, but not enough of her internal conflict or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven; the climax (the portal opening) feels rushed compared to the buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout—rich sensory detail and tone create a vivid, immersive world that supports the character’s journey and the story’s themes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Despite minor flaws, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and creatively integrates its elements with a clear thematic throughline.</comment>
