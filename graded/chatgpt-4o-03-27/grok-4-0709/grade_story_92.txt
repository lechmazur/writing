<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Alex is intriguingly conflicted, and the "carefully careless" trait is mirrored in Elias, establishing psychological depth; however, motivation, while poetic, feels abstract and not deeply earned through prior action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot arc is structurally sound, with a clear inciting incident and eerie resolution, though the leap from blood drive to plant-feeding pact strains believability without more connective tissue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric with vivid sensory cues and complements the theme well; the "loud silence" and decaying grandeur heighten the haunted tension effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and subtextual horror elevate the prose, but some moments veer toward overwriting, and emotional resonance stays coolly distant rather than hauntingly personal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh elements are present, but some phrases verge on pastiche of Gothic tropes; certain constructions feel more constructed than lived, undermining authenticity slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stylistically confident and atmospherically rich, the story sustains intrigue and leaves a lingering impression, though cohesion between method and plot feels lightly stitched.</comment>
