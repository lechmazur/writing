<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and satisfying within the word count, though the emotional climax leans heavily on symbolism that strains coherence slightly; pacing is strong overall.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Language flirts with purple prose, and some phrasing feels performative rather than authentic; originality shines through metaphorical cohesion but risks stylized overindulgence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Despite minor flaws in tonal excess, the story achieves emotional depth, symbolic unity, and a strong voice; the elements harmonize to deliver lasting resonance.</comment>
