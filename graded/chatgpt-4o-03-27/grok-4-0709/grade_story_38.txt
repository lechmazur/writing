<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character is richly drawn—his insomnia, poetic vocation, and emotional contradictions are layered, with motivations that evolve plausibly through his journey. His voice is distinctive and his transformation feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is graceful despite the tight word limit; the narrative arc (inner conflict, method of resolution, thematic closure) is coherent. Some transitions verge on hazy, but overall cause and effect are maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world is evocatively imagined—the attic, subway, and after-parties coalesce into a spectral, moody landscape. Sensory detail is vivid and supports character and tone seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical, symbolic (botanical metaphors, whispering ghosts), and emotionally resonant. The subtext of vulnerability-as-power is a moving inversion. A few lines teeter near overwrought, but overall high craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and layered emotional beats show considerable originality. A few moments flirt with slightly repetitive phrasing, yet the narrative avoids clichés and feels deliberately human and emotionally nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive with elegant integration of all elements. The brevity feels purposeful, and the emotional arc lingers. A highly literary execution that nearly meets the bar for top-tier publication.</comment>
