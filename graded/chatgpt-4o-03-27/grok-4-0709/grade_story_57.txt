<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Everett's submissiveness and perceptiveness are well-integrated into his motivations and actions; his empathy for the pigeon mirrors his own repression, though more internal reflection or complexity could elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete, with a clear arc and resolution; however, the pacing flirts with being too tidy, and the narrative leans heavily on convenience (e.g., overheard plans, tools nearby).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The estate-as-workshop concept is atmospherically rich and the echo chambers offer a clever twist on spy tropes; sensory detail and tone are well matched to the worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and thoughtful, with convincing integration of assigned elements and thematic resonance; it lingers modestly but memorably.</comment>
