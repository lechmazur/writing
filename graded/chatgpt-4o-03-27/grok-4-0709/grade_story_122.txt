<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eron's motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, but his arc feels overly symbolic rather than deeply personal; internal conflict is strong but slightly obscured by abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Well-paced with a complete arc and strong cause-effect logic, though the climax resolution strains credulity with the prism's function bordering on metaphorical rather than literal coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized, atmospheric, and thematically resonant; sensory details and mood amplify the ritualistic tone and spiritual tension excellently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative language, rich symbols, and an emotional climax elevate the story, though the endingâ€™s impact is slightly dulled by over-layered metaphor and lack of dialogue tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and style, but veers toward purple prose in places; metaphor occasionally overwhelms clarity, drifting close to AI-like density though saved by intent and originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Highly creative and conceptually unified, with a resonant symbolic arc; slightly hindered by occasional over-description, yet still leaves a lasting impression of mythic depth.</comment>
