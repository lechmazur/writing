<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn, with his fractured psyche and obsessive motivation grounded in his identity as a dream thief; his emotional arc is compelling and coherent, though his voice could have been even more distinct or humanized to deepen intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains cohesion within the word limit and achieves surprising emotional resolution, but one or two transitions—especially the leap into the photo—feel slightly rushed or abstractly rendered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is consistently immersive and sensory-rich; the decaying treehouse and post-human epoch are hauntingly evoked and deeply entangled with Elias's motivations and mental state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally inventive and emotionally sincere, but a few moments veer toward poetic excess or slight vagueness, risking impression of stylistic overreliance or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong conceptual harmony between all elements, emotionally satisfying resolution, and a poetic, cohesive voice; minor clarity lapses prevent higher rating.</comment>
