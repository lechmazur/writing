<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's dry wit and motivations are clearly defined and well expressed through his dialogue, actions, and emotional arc; however, secondary character Mira could use more depth or complexity to enhance the dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, building logically from setup to emotionally resonant climax with satisfying resolution; the pacing is excellent for the word limit, though the transition into the dance scene could benefit from slightly more grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric and integral to the story’s mood and metaphor; sensory language is vivid without being overwrought, with a deft integration of setting into character and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, strong metaphor (the eroding promises), and emotionally resonant resolution; the ending lingers, though some lines toe the line of melodrama or slight over-description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Impressively original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., lighthouse beam as blade), though a few phrases feel slightly too polished or risk feeling AI-like in rhythm or symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally satisfying, and creatively woven; assigned elements are mostly organic, and the story feels complete within its scope, though minor refinements in dialogue or Mira’s character could elevate it to excellence.</comment>
