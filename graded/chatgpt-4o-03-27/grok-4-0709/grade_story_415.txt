<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is effectively rooted in personal history and emotional conflict; his ability to "taste memories" enhances his depth, though his brother remains thinly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and well-paced, culminating in a satisfying moment of personal resolution; however, the transition from stadium to cabin feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly immersive use of setting; the mist, rain, and yodeling valley powerfully evoke mood and mirror the internal conflict, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich in emotional subtlety and metaphor (tasting memories, rain trails as paths into the past), though a bit more narrative tension could deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original metaphoric framing (memory-tasting chef) and some fresh imagery, though a few phrases verge on overwritten and some elements feel slightly wedged in.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Well-constructed and emotionally resonant, with elements mostly integrated seamlessly; a few minor forced connections prevent top-tier score.</comment>
