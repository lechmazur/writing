<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is powerful and consistent, tightly bound to his past pain and his clumsy dexterity; however, deeper psychological nuance is still somewhat surface-level, missing greater internal complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Unifies all elements with rare elegance and artistry; emotional resonance and stylistic polish are strong, though a final visceral moment might elevate it further toward absolute distinction.</comment>
