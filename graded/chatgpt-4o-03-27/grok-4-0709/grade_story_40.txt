<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered with strong internal motivation, a distinct voice, and consistent emotional depth; his obsession with aquariums and the symbolic soldier reveal layered guilt, though Mira could be further developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is compact yet complete; the guilt-alleviation storyline resolves through a meaningful encounter, though the weather-trigger method feels mildly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of the forgotten recipe library is rich, atmospheric, and thematically precise, enhancing mood and supporting the introspective tone and symbolic framework.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical layering (e.g., fish bowls, soldier, recipes) and a deeply resonant emotional through line elevate the tale; ending offers soft catharsis, though a bit more tension payoff would strengthen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Highly original premise with symbolic richness; the language is inventive and mostly fresh, though occasionally borders on ornate or over-structured in ways that hint at calculated crafting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive use of assigned elements, with a resonant central metaphor and emotionally complete arc; could benefit from slightly more subtlety in emotional resolution.</comment>
