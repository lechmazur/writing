<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivations and personality as a tragically joyful, telepathic statue are clearly established and consistently drive her thoughtful, poetic actions, yet minor ambiguity in Lila's emotional journey slightly weakens secondary character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and the transformation arc satisfying, with a strong emotional crescendo, though the pacing of the Lila revelation and execution of the weatherizing feels slightly rushed and overly idealized near the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steam-powered city is richly realized with tactile, immersive detail; the contrast between mechanical artifice and ancient truth deepens the mood and supports the character's purpose masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The use of metaphor and symbol is lyrical and moving; the story evokes both melancholy and hope through elegant prose, though it borders on overstatement and could benefit from more organic emotion in spots.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite minor over-stylization and slightly idealized emotional beats, the story feels cohesive, artistically composed, and thematically resonant, with a lingering melancholy that invites deeper reflection.</comment>
