<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in family legacy and personal obsession, with actions tightly aligned to his drive—though his emotional inner life could be richer and more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a full arc within the limit with strong cause-effect logic and effective pacing; the “performance art” ritual is well-integrated but slightly strains plausibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original combination of science, folklore, and performance in a small-town setting; only minor over-formality in tone occasionally hints at formula.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Skillful weaving of disparate elements into a cohesive, resonant narrative with emotional and metaphysical stakes; high polish, though a touch more ambiguity might deepen impact.</comment>
