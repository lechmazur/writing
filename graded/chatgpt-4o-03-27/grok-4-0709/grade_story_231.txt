<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Eresh’s motivations are tied clearly to his past and the hairpin, with spontaneous actions and sentimental resolve driving his confrontation, but his voice lacks distinctiveness and development feels rushed within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot achieves a beginning, middle, and end with strong cause-effect logic, but pacing is tight and the method (coordinates, meeting) feels underdeveloped and too conveniently inserted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and rich in sensory detail, with the ancient setting effectively supporting tone and action; excellent use of mood to mirror internal conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (hairpin, anchor), layered themes (justice, grief, chaos), and emotional beats, though some metaphors verge on ornate and the storytelling impact would benefit from subtlety over declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Original combinations of elements and some poetic imagery, but occasionally dips into formulaic structure or overused phrasing; emotional moments sometimes told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive overall with ambitious thematic interplay, but not flawless—some transitions feel forced, and complexity slightly undercuts clarity despite strong literary intentions.</comment>
