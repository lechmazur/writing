<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara is vividly characterized; her dutiful defiance and motivation to heal the town are clear and reinforced through consistent, symbolic actions like using the toy ear and cooking as acts of rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story follows a clear arc enhanced by symbolic cohesion—cooking mirrors emotional transformation. Cause and effect are logical, though the climax could benefit from sharper escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The metaphorical amber prison is hauntingly vivid, and the sensory details—especially smell and light—are deployed artfully to build a cloistered, nostalgic, and transformative mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (amber, cooking, toy ear) and shifts in tone and theme elevate the narrative; the emotional impact is subtle but lingers. Slight lack of narrative tension prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh and purposeful, voice is distinct, and device use is thoughtful. Occasional repetition and a few overly ornate turns hold it back slightly from peak originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive, lyrical exploration of transformation and resistance within constrained space. The elements mostly serve the whole, though the plot's magical realism strains believability in places.</comment>
