<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's characterization as a blunt heretic is clearly established and consistent throughout; her motivation tied to her mother and the teddy bear creates emotional depth, though the voice occasionally leans toward narration over direct insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The intellectual battle is well-framed and the arc resolves cleanly, though transitions between the ticker code interactions and her emotional beats feel slightly abrupt in places.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory language; the tone and atmosphere strongly support the tension and Elaraâ€™s internal state, enhancing narrative immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While largely original and emotionally nuanced, moments of overly formal phrasing and slightly formulaic metaphor weaken the freshness of the voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive and emotionally satisfying story that integrates its elements meaningfully; a few stylistic excesses and minor structural stiffness keep it short of top-tier polish.</comment>
