<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara is richly drawn—her contradiction between zeal and tenderness gives depth, and Mia’s arc carries emotional resonance, though slightly compressed by the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear structure with a beginning, crisis, and resolution; the organ climax is effective, but transitions (Mia’s disappearance and return) feel slightly abrupt.</comment>
