<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias is a vivid figure with a defined voice and backstory, and his motivations are clearly linked to his past, though his emotional evolution feels somewhat static and his reactions to the prejudice could use more depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story maintains structural coherence and progression, but the calculated "accident" resolution feels slightly contrived and overly convenient; the narrative arc could be cleaner with fewer metaphysical flourishes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mirror maze and cosmic echoes create a richly immersive and eerie atmosphere; sensory details and setting support the theme and mood effectively, making the world feel both surreal and tethered to Elias's psyche.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The symbolism and emotional undertones are strong but occasionally undermined by overwritten passages and abstract phrasing that cloud clarity; still, the arc is resonant and thematically focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Displays original ambition with some creative combinations, but moments of formulaic phrasing and slightly mechanical metaphors reduce its freshness; the theme is handled with more competence than surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and deliberate in tone, with an intriguing use of elements and thematic resonance, though some ideas feel forced and the execution sometimes prioritizes concept over clarity.</comment>
