<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are clear and consistently portrayed through his obsessive rituals and interaction with the notebook; however, his emotional complexity lacks some subtle shading, and his voice, while earnest, isn't especially distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying within the word count, with a strong beginning, middle, and end; however, some transitions between events feel rushed or overly convenient due to the reliance on sudden encounters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The urban orchard is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, blending decay and renewal in support of plot and atmosphere; sensory detail is evocative and immersive throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong craft, layered symbolism, and effective subtext; however, certain emotional beats—particularly Elias’s transformation—could benefit from more nuance and less direct description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is original, avoiding clichés and purple prose; still, some metaphors verge on grandiosity, and the voice lacks the idiosyncrasy or stylistic risks that mark truly exceptional prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>This is a cohesive and ambitious piece with a strong blend of surrealism, emotion, and worldbuilding; while quite strong, a greater sense of interior complexity or narrative surprise would elevate it further.</comment>
