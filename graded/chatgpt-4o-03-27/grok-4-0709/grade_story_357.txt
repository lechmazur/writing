<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's personality and motivation are well-articulated through his dialogue, actions, and symbolic relationship with solitude and the black rose; his odd but consistent behavior deepens the character without becoming contradictory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a clear arc with a beginning (solitary setup), middle (temptation via invitation), and resolution (despair defeated), though the party invitation feels momentarily disruptive in its suddenness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong, specific sensory detail immerses the reader in the frost giant's lair; atmosphere effectively mirrors Elias’s internal struggle and supports the theme of isolation as strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (black rose, game) is thoughtful, and Elias’s internal battle is compelling; some literary devices are effective but verge on overwrought at times, weakening their impact slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Though overall original and thematically cohesive, some turns of phrase feel slightly too ornate or stylized, and there are faint hints of pattern-based prose structure typical of AI composition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Despite minor tonal inconsistencies, the story feels complete, conceptually unified, and thematically resonant; the elements are largely well-integrated and purposeful.</comment>
