<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s "restlessly curious" nature is well-embedded in her voice and decision-making, and Elias’s motivations are believable, though the emotional shifts feel slightly compressed given the short length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure flows logically and achieves a full arc, but the return journey feels slightly rushed; the emotional stakes are introduced and addressed with clarity despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and symbolically resonant; the sky pool and time-fracture imagery enhance the mood and support the story’s themes effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poetic language and metaphorical depth elevate the narrative, though some moments lean toward over-description; the emotional payoff is strong and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mostly original, though certain phrases ("voice a velvet trap," "desires have gravity") feel slightly mannered or overly literary; emotional nuance is present but occasionally verges on stylized detachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Overall, a cohesive, atmospheric piece where elements serve the theme well; slightly sacrificing clarity in moments of poetic abstraction but still emotionally compelling and stylistically unified.</comment>
