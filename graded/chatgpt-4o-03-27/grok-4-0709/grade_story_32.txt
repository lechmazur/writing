<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong internal logic to the character’s motivation and actions; emotional resonance through memory and loss is well established and maintained, though voice remains distant, lacking an idiosyncratic edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impressive arc within constraints—beginning, build, climax, resolution all present; method integrated into structure well; but pacing verges on lyrical overkill at times, slightly dampening momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersive—ghost town, dawn light, creaking saloon doors all render a palpable sense of place; tone and setting synergize effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking symbolism, emotional depth, and lyrical execution elevate this; subtext about artificiality vs. authenticity resonates powerfully; crescendo is compelling, though edges close to over-romanticization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concepts feel fresh and fused with surprising elegance; some metaphorical flourishes flirt with purple prose, but overall the originality and inventiveness ring true and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, layered, and emotionally resonant; minor overreliance on poetic abstraction keeps it from unanimity, but undeniably a publishable piece in top-tier circles.</comment>
