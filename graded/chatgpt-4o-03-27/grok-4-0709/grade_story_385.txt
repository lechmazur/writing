<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s manipulative nature and obsession with influence are clearly portrayed, but her emotional depth and internal conflict are underexplored, limiting full character immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The structure is sound with a clear arc, but the symbolic method feels slightly grafted on; the lucid beach scene, while atmospheric, strains believability within the otherwise grounded hospital setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thoughtful, and emotionally resonant, though certain symbolic elements feel more ornamental than essential; nonetheless, the manipulation theme is well executed.</comment>
