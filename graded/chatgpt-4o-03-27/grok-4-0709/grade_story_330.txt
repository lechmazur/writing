<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elandor's arc from dejection to resolve is well-conceived but somewhat under-dramatized emotionally; internal transformation is described more than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a compelling arc anchored by the chime, but the transition from aimlessness to action unfolds too quickly, lacking tension between beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and deeply integrated, with strong sensory and symbolic resonance that complements the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Poetic language and metaphor add depth, though at times verge on overwrought; ending has weight, but the emotional payoff could be stronger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inventive use of elements and strong style, but some metaphors feel more decorative than essential, and moments of purple prose weaken clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original, cohesive, and emotionally resonant, though refinement in pacing and clarity would push it closer to publishable excellence.</comment>
