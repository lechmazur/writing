<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s characterization as “cautiously adventurous” is consistently reflected in both his real-world demeanor and dreamlike actions; however, Mira remains too enigmatic to fully support his development arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story adheres to a coherent arc with a strong inciting incident and resolution, but the transition to the underwater library—though imaginative—feels abrupt and risks disorienting the reader.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail that enhances atmosphere and symbolizes the story’s themes; excellent tone-setting and immersive world-building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery and poetic tone elevate the piece, but mildly overpolished diction and some abstract phrasing hint at formulaic tendencies that slightly dilute originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ambitious in scope yet mostly cohesive, with a unified theme and emotional throughline; minor tonal inconsistencies and subtle mechanical moments keep it from full polish.</comment>
