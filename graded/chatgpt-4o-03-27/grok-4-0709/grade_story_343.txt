<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Larkspur's personality and motivation are clearly drawn and suitably eccentric; Mira adds contrast and growth, but crew characterization is thin beyond them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot has a strong arc and resolution within tight constraints, but the transition into augury feels slightly abrupt and could be more organically seeded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is rich, immersive, and tonally aligned with the character’s inner landscape; sensory detail like the brass, steam, and metallic tang is deftly handled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Unexpected juxtapositions like “isosceles whispers” and ritualistic math create fresh imagery; minor overwriting in places, but originality is strong throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of disparate elements leads to a layered, memorable story; though not flawless, it's near-ready for publication with modest refinement.</comment>
