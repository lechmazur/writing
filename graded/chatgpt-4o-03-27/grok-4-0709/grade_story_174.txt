<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias has clear motivation and a defined personality, but emotional transformation is too convenient and underexplored; Amelia remains a vague symbol rather than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arc is mostly coherent and complete, but transitions between metaphorical elements (leaves, frost, fireworks) strain believability and clarity in spots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through setting, sensory detail, and tone; the frost-car-window-to-hidden-library sequence is conceptually strong and immersive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poetic language and visual metaphors are often fresh and striking, though occasionally verge on over-orchestration or veer into familiar melancholic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Well-executed blend of concept and emotion with unique flair, but theme execution wavers between visionary and slightly abstracted from the human core.</comment>
