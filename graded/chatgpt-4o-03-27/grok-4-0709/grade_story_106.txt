<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is convincingly portrayed, with his sullen demeanor and agricultural despair grounding his motivation; the quilt and stamps deepen his emotional arc, though his shift to “heroic” zest feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot flows with clarity and purpose despite complexity, with a strong arc from isolation to transformation; the symbolic act is well-integrated, though the power-station revival verges on magical realism without setup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong cohesion of elements with creative synthesis; ending offers thematic closure and emotional lift, though tonal balance wavers between authentic emotion and romanticized transformation.</comment>
