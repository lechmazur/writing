<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara and Kai are well-defined through subtle emotional cues and symbolic actions; motivations are consistent yet understated in alignment with "distant intimacy", but more direct character voice or contrast in perspective could deepen complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure is elegant and coherent with a clear arc, though heavily reliant on symbolic repositioning that may feel metaphorically dense to some readers; pacing is graceful but risks ambiguity without rereading.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined castle is richly atmospheric, blending ancient and futuristic with poetic precision that enhances tone and motivation; sensory detail is evocative and immersive throughout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism and metaphor enriches subtext; the subtle emotional evolution feels organic and resonant, with strong literary effect despite minimal overt action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but mostly avoids purple excess; originality high in metaphorical framework, though occasional lines veer toward ornamental repetition or risk of vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between elements, emotionally satisfying arc, and lyrical prose suggest a publishable work; minor risks in abstraction and density prevent a perfect score.</comment>
