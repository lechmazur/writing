<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elaron's characterization is consistent, with his "objectively emotional" nature intricately linked to his actions and internal conflict; his motivation is clear, and his arc completes logically through sacrifice, though slightly abstract at emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution within the word limit; the method logically unlocks the action, but pacing slightly compresses the transformation scene, limiting deeper stakes exploration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and offers fresh metaphors, but some phrasing veers toward high-concept abstraction, risking minor disconnection; however, tone and theme integration reflect unique authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements are woven with care into a complete, affecting narrative; though densely layered, the clarity mostly holds and the story leaves an impression of elegant melancholy and sacrifice.</comment>
