<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is well-rendered with consistent absent-mindedness and ironically hopeful motivation; Mira’s parallel doubts enrich development, though some emotional turns feel implied rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the constraint, though the resolution leans on poetic symbolism over a tightly resolved arc; pacing is mostly effective, if slightly meandering mid-story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The post-AI world is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory interplay and symbolic resonance in the archive setting; the brass knocker and digital/organic contrasts create compelling atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection on humanity vs. technology through layered metaphor and emotional subtext; while rich in theme, a more grounded central tension would elevate impact further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids major clichés and shows distinct authorial voice; some phrasing veers into ornate abstractions, risking purple prose, but fresh metaphors and specific sensory detail preserve authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A thoughtful and emotionally resonant narrative with elegant thematic fusion; minor over-reliance on symbolism prevents a stronger emotional climax, but cohesion and originality are commendable.</comment>
