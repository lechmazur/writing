<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Li Wei’s calm demeanor and methodical nature are consistently portrayed, and his motivation is clearly aligned with his actions and the story’s tone; however, we get little emotional interiority beyond strategic thought, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot follows a well-contained arc with clear stakes, method, and resolution within the tight word limit; the pacing and logic of the plan are tight, though the outcomes remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The palace’s sensory-rich garden and moonlit setting are evocative and enhance the mystical tension; the tone and atmosphere are tightly interwoven with the narrative’s emotional and thematic layers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story’s allegorical layering and vivid prose create substantial thematic depth and turn the core concept into a poetic mechanism; a subtle, satisfying ending reinforces the butterfly motif, though humor remains faint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The butterfly method and “figuratively literal” plant concept show cleverness and voice, though some phrasing verges on ornate, and a few metaphors feel slightly overengineered; emotional nuance is strong but not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive with nearly all elements serving story and tone; creative, layered, and stylistically consistent, though it leans more cerebral than emotionally moving.</comment>
