<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara is vividly sketched with a consistent and compelling motivation, though Torin's development is thinner and remains largely reactive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds a moment of emotional climax effectively but lacks a fully satisfying arc or resolution; it feels more like a vignette than a complete narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sensory-rich, atmospheric setting is immersive and enhances tone; the longhouse and era feel authentic and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor are strong with layered emotional subtext, but the lack of conflict or narrative shift weakens overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Many metaphors shine, but occasional overwriting and slightly formulaic emotional beats diminish its freshness; some "AI shine-through" in ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and aesthetically deliberate, with creative integration of elements, but emotional resonance is moderate rather than profound.</comment>
