<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mostly avoids AI tropes and purple prose; style is lyrical yet controlled, though the "elixir to save the world" motif borders on conventional without significant subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of elements with strong thematic unity; while not flawless, it leaves a lasting impression and balances tone with ambition exceptionally well for the format.</comment>
