<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's quiet hunger and wistful curiosity are well portrayed and evolve naturally with the discovery, though his internal arc could benefit from sharper emotional peaks to solidify transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The overall arc is clear and thematically unified, but the pacing is slightly diffuse—transitions between discovery beats could be more narratively dynamic to heighten tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The magnetic mountain and abandoned theater are atmospheric and symbolically resonant; sensory details like flickering projections and dust-laced murals are immersive and support mood and character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong layers of metaphor and symbolism enrich the narrative; the use of the spoon and murals is inventive, and the final emotional shift is thematically satisfying but slightly over-explained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mostly avoids clichéd phrasing and demonstrates stylistic originality; some phrasing flirts with purple prose, and a few transitions feel slightly too polished or archetypal to feel fully human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Excellent thematic fusion and imaginative vision; feels intentionally compact rather than constrained, though stylistic polish could be refined for maximal impact in a top-tier venue.</comment>
