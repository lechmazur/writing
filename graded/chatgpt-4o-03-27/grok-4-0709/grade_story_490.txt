<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is richly developed; his fading state and ritualistic behavior are deeply tied to his motivation, creating a poignant, believable portrait driven by paradoxical desire and detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is conceptually tight with a complete arc—ritual, escalation, climax, resolution—but relies slightly too much on atmosphere over external conflict or tension to drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Magnificently immersive worldbuilding—setting, time, and object are seamlessly interwoven through sensory language that enriches tone and character psychology.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original voice and imagery; avoids cliché and purple prose with purposefully melancholic lyricism. Some metaphor stacking pushes the limit but mostly enhances depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive use of assigned elements; layered with subtext and thematic unity—death, obsession, entropy, and curiosity woven into a compact yet expansive narrative.</comment>
