<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias is a well-realized character whose layered motivations—redemption, guilt, hope—clearly inform his actions; “dishonest honesty” adds nuance and consistency, though some emotional turns feel slightly compressed due to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound with a satisfying emotional resolution; a few threads, like the abandoned nest and construction zone, could feel incidental rather than essential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy is richly rendered with tactile atmosphere and sensory detail; the setting enhances tone and character psychology effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ember, music), consistent tone, and emotional layering; the yodel-as-signal turned redemption motif is thematically resonant, though slightly on-the-nose in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Impressively original in imagery and concept blending; leans occasionally into poetic abstraction, but mostly avoids formulaic AI patterns or generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherent, emotionally resonant, and inventive; a few minor elements feel slightly shoehorned but are handled with care and narrative purpose.</comment>
