<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Al/Dr. Thorne is distinct and his motivation is clear, but his "suspiciously trusting" trait is underdeveloped and mostly implied through exposition rather than dramatized action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and maintains coherence, but the transition from raking leaves to decoding sigils in a mirror maze feels slightly abrupt and under-justified.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with strong sensory detail; the setting enhances the tone and supports the character’s mission effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Well-crafted and cohesive with a lingering sense of mystery; the story feels complete and purposeful within its constraints.</comment>
