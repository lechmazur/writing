<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character is vividly rendered through action and internal conflict; his silence, limp, and reverence for the past all reinforce his motivation, though his emotional arc could be deepened slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the harp-bridge sequence is inventive, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt given the buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and original, with strong sensory and conceptual integration; the digital wilderness and classroom hush create a haunting, effective atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (harp, chip, ghosts), with emotional resonance and thematic depth; however, the prose occasionally leans toward overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally avoids clich√©s and shows stylistic flair, but some phrases verge on purple prose and the harp metaphor, while unique, strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich; the story feels complete and lingers in the mind, though a touch more clarity in stakes would elevate it further.</comment>
