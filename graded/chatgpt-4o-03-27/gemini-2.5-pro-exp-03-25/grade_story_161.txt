<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn, her grief and obsessive focus deeply rooted in her past as an orchardist; her motivations are consistent and compelling, though her emotional arc could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and satisfying within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution; however, the climax feels slightly rushed and the conspiracy reveal could use more buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospherically distinct, with strong sensory details that reinforce Elara’s emotional state and the story’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (orchard tending, phoenix, peacock patterns); the story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, though the final confrontation borders on didactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise and voice, with fresh metaphors and a unique setting; a few moments verge on overwritten or slightly mechanical, but overall the style is distinctive and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally grounded, and thematically rich; the story feels complete and lingers after reading, though a touch more subtlety in the reveal would elevate it further.</comment>
