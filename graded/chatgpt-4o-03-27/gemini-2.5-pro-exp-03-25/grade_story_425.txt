<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s personality is sharply defined—his morose demeanor, sense of duty, and obsession with restoration are consistent and drive his actions; the scavenger encounter further reveals his rigidity and desperation, though the scavenger remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc—setup, disruption, conflict, and resolution—within the word limit; the blackout and flare energy are well-integrated, though the scavenger subplot could use more payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and thematic resonance; the observatory’s decay and the cosmic backdrop enhance the tone and character motivation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong prose with evocative imagery and subtle symbolism (needle, light, decay); the ending is quietly powerful, though emotional depth is more implied than deeply felt—some moments could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original blend of sci-fi and mythic tone; avoids clichés and purple prose, with fresh metaphors and a consistent, distinctive voice—though the scavenger’s role feels slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and atmospheric; the story feels complete and thematically unified, with creative use of elements—minor character imbalance and slightly abrupt resolution prevent a perfect score.</comment>
