<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo’s phobias and self-destructive motivations are deeply embedded in his actions and internal arc; his confrontation with fear through tactile ritual is psychologically rich and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc from discovery to resolution, with a clear internal transformation; however, the leap from garage sale to pyramid strains plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotion is conveyed through action and setting rather than exposition; the story avoids clichés and demonstrates a unique voice, though a few phrases verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically resonant, and emotionally affecting; it lingers in the mind and uses its brevity as a strength rather than a constraint.</comment>
