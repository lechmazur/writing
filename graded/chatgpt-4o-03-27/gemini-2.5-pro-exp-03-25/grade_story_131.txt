<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness and orphan status are subtly but effectively conveyed through her actions and internal conflict; her motivation to transform fear into courage is consistent and drives the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with logical cause-effect progression; however, the cryptic message feels slightly under-integrated into the plot's momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garage setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details and the gravitational anomaly enhancing mood and theme; the surreal physics are well-woven into the emotional tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (stones, anomaly), emotional resonance, and subtext; the ending is quiet but purposeful, though the message delivery device (lottery ticket) feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids clich√© and formulaic phrasing; the tone is consistent and the emotional nuance is well-handled, though the cryptic message and anomaly risk feeling like genre tropes without deeper subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Well-crafted, emotionally resonant, and thematically cohesive; the story lingers after reading, though a few elements (message, anomaly) could be more organically integrated.</comment>
