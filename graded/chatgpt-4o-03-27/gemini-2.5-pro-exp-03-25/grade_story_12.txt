<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen is well-drawn, with his aloofness and deeper yearning consistently reflected in his actions and reactions; Elara is less developed but serves her narrative function effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotional resolution; however, the transition from anomaly to emotional connection feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The futuristic mall is vividly rendered with strong sensory and conceptual detail; the cracked tile and holographic sky are particularly evocative and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (cracked tile, digital rivers); emotional resonance is present, though the dialogue occasionally leans toward the overly poetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids clich√© and demonstrates originality in concept and execution; a few phrases verge on ornate, but overall the voice is distinct and emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Well-crafted and cohesive, with a lingering emotional impact and thematic depth; a few moments could benefit from more restraint or clarity, but overall highly effective.</comment>
