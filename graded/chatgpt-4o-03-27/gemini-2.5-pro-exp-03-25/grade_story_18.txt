<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Galen is a compelling, well-developed character whose telepathy and stillness contrast with his emotional depth; the scribe adds a subtle but effective foil, though her arc could be slightly more defined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional climax; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the resolution leans more thematic than plot-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steam-powered city is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the oppressive mood enhances the themes of hidden truth and emotional repression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative prose, rich symbolism (e.g., the hair tie), and emotional resonance elevate the story; the calligraphy metaphor adds depth, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original concept and voice with minimal clich√©; some metaphors verge on purple, but overall the story avoids formulaic patterns and shows nuanced emotional insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic clarity; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though a slightly tighter integration of all assigned elements would enhance impact.</comment>
