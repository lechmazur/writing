<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motivation is clearly established and consistent, and his actions align with his past as a swordsman and his desire for escape; however, his emotional depth and internal conflict could be more fully explored to elevate the character beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a strong sense of cause and effect, but the climax feels slightly rushed and the resolution leans more toward atmospheric ambiguity than narrative closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and stylistically distinct, with fresh imagery and a unique premise; some phrases verge on overwrought, and a few transitions feel slightly mechanical, but overall the voice is compelling and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, with a strong conceptual core and stylistic ambition; minor clarity issues and a slightly diffuse ending prevent a higher score.</comment>
