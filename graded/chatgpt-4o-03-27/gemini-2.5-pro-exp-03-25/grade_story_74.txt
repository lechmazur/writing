<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet rebellion and yearning for unpredictability are well-aligned with her minimalist bard identity; her motivation is clear and consistent, though her emotional depth could be more fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a satisfying arc and logical progression; the sequence of numbers as a method is slightly underdeveloped in execution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original concept and voice with minimal cliché; some phrasing borders on overly formal, but the story avoids formulaic patterns and maintains a distinct style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and thematically rich; the story lingers with its quiet defiance and poetic tone, though a touch more emotional immediacy would deepen its resonance.</comment>
