<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jax is vividly drawn with consistent motivation rooted in grief and longing; his emotional arc is clear and compelling, though slightly underexplored in terms of internal conflict evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a strong emotional throughline and a satisfying arc, but the pacing falters slightly near the climax, where the tea leaf reading feels rushed and under-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details that enhance tone and character mood; the decaying spaceport mirrors Jax’s internal desolation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolic layering (chopstick, tea leaves, waterfalls); the ending is poignant, though the tea ritual could be more thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and demonstrates a distinct voice; some metaphors verge on overwrought, but overall the writing feels human and emotionally nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Well-crafted and emotionally rich, with a cohesive blend of elements; minor integration issues with the method and timeframe prevent a higher score.</comment>
