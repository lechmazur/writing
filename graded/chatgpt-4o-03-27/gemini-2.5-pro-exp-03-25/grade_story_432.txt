<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s paradoxical nature—heightened senses from poison tasting and a death wish—adds depth and complexity; his motivations and actions align well, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear climax and resolution; the method of interpreting psychic calls is imaginative but strains plausibility slightly within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The subterranean setting is richly rendered with vivid sensory detail; atmosphere powerfully supports the character’s internal state and the story’s mystical tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive, atmospheric, and emotionally layered; the story feels complete and deliberate, though one or two elements feel more decorative than essential.</comment>
