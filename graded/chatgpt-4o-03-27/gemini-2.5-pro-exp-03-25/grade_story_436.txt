<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical progression, with the action of bifurcating the dust driving the climax; however, the resolution is more symbolic than concrete, leaving some narrative tension unresolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory details and a tone that enhances the character’s emotional state; the floating fortress and desert backdrop feel integral to the story’s atmosphere.</comment>
