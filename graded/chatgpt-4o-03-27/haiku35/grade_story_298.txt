<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a strong climax; however, the cold-case-solving element feels underdeveloped as a plot driver.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and emotionally compelling; the story lingers in the mind, though a slightly clearer integration of the mystery-solving method would enhance clarity.</comment>
