<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is a well-drawn character with a clear internal conflict and motivation; his mime performance as a language of reconciliation is both original and emotionally resonant, though Sebastian remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, with the climax arriving abruptly and the resolution feeling slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere that enhances the emotional tone and supports the narrative’s themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (gauntlet, coral texture), with a poignant emotional payoff; however, the story leans slightly on exposition over subtext in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally avoids clichés and shows stylistic flair, but some phrasing feels slightly overwritten or too polished, and Sebastian’s reaction is a bit too convenient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotionally satisfying and thematically cohesive, with creative use of elements; minor issues with pacing and secondary character depth prevent a higher score.</comment>
