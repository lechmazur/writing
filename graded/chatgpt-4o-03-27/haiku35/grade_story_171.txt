<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with a clear obsession and emotional drive, though his internal arc could be more dynamic or challenged to deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds toward a moment of revelation, but lacks a strong narrative arc or clear conflict-resolution structure; the climax is more atmospheric than plot-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory detail and a surreal tone that enhances the magical realism; the carnival and orchard imagery are evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong prose and atmosphere, but the emotional payoff is muted; the story leans heavily on mood and concept without fully grounding the reader in stakes or transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original in tone and concept, but some metaphors verge on overwrought and the narrative occasionally feels like a collage of ideas rather than a cohesive whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inventive and atmospheric with a strong thematic throughline, but lacks the narrative clarity and emotional resonance required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
