<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from a self-serving mercenary to someone willing to confront a cosmic threat is compelling, but his internal conflict could be more deeply dramatized to fully earn the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds tension and stakes effectively, but the arc feels more like a prologue than a complete narrative; resolution is implied rather than delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the prose avoids clichés and shows stylistic ambition, some phrasing veers into overwrought territory, and the emotional nuance occasionally feels stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, but its reliance on atmosphere over action may limit its accessibility; it feels like a strong excerpt rather than a standalone piece.</comment>
