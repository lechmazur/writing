<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria is vividly drawn with a strong internal logic; her motivations align with her past and her symbolic use of the plush adds emotional depth, though her "zealot" aspect could be more sharply defined in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is conceptually complete and thematically coherent, but the lack of external conflict or stakes makes the plot feel more meditative than dynamic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coral reef city is richly imagined and atmospherically immersive, with bioluminescent flora and engineered ecosystems enhancing the philosophical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism elevates the narrative; the plush elephant and moral ambiguity are handled with subtlety, though the emotional arc could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept and tone, but some phrasing veers toward ornate abstraction, and the "reversed echoes" method feels underdeveloped or metaphorical rather than concrete.</comment>
