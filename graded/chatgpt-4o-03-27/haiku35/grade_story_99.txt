<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus has a clear motivation and a consistent internal logic, but his personality lacks depth beyond his mystical purpose; the "strictly casual" trait is mentioned but not meaningfully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc and builds toward a revelation, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the flashback mechanism feels underdeveloped as a structural device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric with strong sensory detail; the carnival booth and ambient sounds effectively support the tone and theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically ambitious, but its execution leans too heavily on abstraction at the expense of emotional immediacy and character nuance.</comment>
