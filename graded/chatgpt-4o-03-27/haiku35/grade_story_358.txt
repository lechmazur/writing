<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on overwrought and a few transitions feel formulaic, but the voice is mostly consistent and the imagery often striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Despite minor flaws, the story is cohesive, imaginative, and lingers in the mind; the elements mostly serve the narrative rather than feeling imposed.</comment>
