<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei Lin is vividly drawn with a compelling internal logic; her motivations are clear and consistent, and her actions reflect a deep alignment with her role and beliefs. Her "reliably unreliable" nature is subtly but effectively conveyed through her subversive work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution. The pacing is well-managed, though the "kink" in the plan could be more concretely dramatized rather than abstractly described.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and symbolically resonant, with strong sensory detail and a seamless integration of tone, time, and place. The kaleidoscope studio and chipped tile are especially evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with layered symbolism and a strong central metaphor. The prose is elegant without being overwrought, though the ending could land with slightly more narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice. Some phrasing borders on ornate, but overall the language is purposeful and avoids clich√©. The story feels authored, not templated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic unity across all elements. The story feels complete and deliberate, with a lingering emotional and intellectual impact. A few moments verge on abstraction but do not undermine the whole.</comment>
