<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is a well-drawn character with a clear arc from vengeance to redemption; his motivation is consistent and his internal conflict is effectively externalized through the tattoos and interactions with the therapist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a satisfying arc and resolution; however, the transition from espionage to spiritual unraveling feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (yarn, tattoos, unraveling); the story evokes reflection and emotional resonance, though some dialogue edges toward the overly poetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While original in concept and execution, a few phrases verge on ornate or overly formal, and the tone occasionally slips into generic mysticism; still, the story avoids cliché and shows stylistic intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and creativity; the story feels complete and leaves a lasting impression, though a few transitions could be smoother for maximum clarity.</comment>
