<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with a clear internal logic—his prophetic calm, symbolic use of the skateboard, and revolutionary intent all align well; however, his emotional arc remains somewhat static, limiting deeper transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story builds a compelling arc of preparation and purpose, but lacks a concrete external event or climax to fully resolve the tension; the pacing is strong, yet the plot feels more like a prologue than a complete narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The steampunk setting is richly evoked with sensory detail and metaphor, enhancing the mood and supporting the character’s mission; the atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., skateboard as weapon of transformation), with a consistent tone and layered meaning; however, the lack of dialogue or dynamic interaction slightly limits emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in concept and voice, with fresh metaphors and a unique protagonist; some phrasing borders on overwrought, and the narrative occasionally leans into abstraction over specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite its introspective tone, the story feels cohesive and purposeful, with a strong thematic throughline and stylistic unity; it lingers in the mind, though it stops short of full narrative catharsis.</comment>
