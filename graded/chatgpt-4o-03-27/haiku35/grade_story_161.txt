<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in personal loss; his meticulous nature and symbolic use of the peacock's tail deepen his character, though his emotional arc could be more layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds toward a satisfying resolution, but the pacing feels slightly compressed, and the climax lacks a dramatic turning point to fully elevate the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard and study are vividly rendered, and the atmosphere supports the tone and theme well; however, the paper airplane facility feels underutilized as a setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (peacock tail, orchard), with a compelling emotional core and thematic resonance; the ending is satisfying but could benefit from more subtextual complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh and purposeful, but a few phrases verge on formulaic; the writing avoids clich√©s overall but doesn't fully escape familiar narrative beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with creative integration of elements and a clear theme; minor tonal inconsistencies and underused elements prevent a higher score.</comment>
