<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's character is sharply defined through her obsessive collecting, intellectual rigor, and internal struggle with despair; her motivation is consistent and compelling, though her emotional arc could be more subtly rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution; however, the metaphysical board game structure, while intriguing, borders on abstract and could benefit from more grounded stakes.</comment>
