<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn, with his gambler's mindset informing both his scientific risk-taking and emotional volatility; his motivations are clear and consistent, though Harriet's depth is more symbolic than fully developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot builds effectively toward a climactic moment, with a strong sense of arc and pacing; however, the resolution leans on ambiguity rather than concrete consequence, slightly weakening narrative closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory detail and tone tightly interwoven; the coastal station, candlelight, and storm all reinforce the story’s emotional and thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (especially the candle mold), with emotionally resonant prose and layered subtext; some dialogue veers toward the theatrical, slightly undermining realism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally avoids cliché and formula, with fresh imagery and a distinctive voice; a few moments feel slightly overwritten or verge on purple prose, but overall the style is purposeful and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally charged, and thematically cohesive; the story lingers after reading, though a touch more narrative specificity would elevate it to top-tier literary excellence.</comment>
