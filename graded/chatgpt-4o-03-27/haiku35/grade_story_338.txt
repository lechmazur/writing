<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria is vividly drawn with a clear, consistent motivation and a distinct personality; her detachment and eccentricity are well-integrated, though her emotional arc remains subtle and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story builds tension effectively and maintains internal logic, but lacks a fully satisfying resolution or narrative arc; it ends on a moment of anticipation rather than closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original and stylistically distinct, with fresh metaphors and a cohesive tone; a few phrases verge on ornate, but overall avoids clich√© and formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive and cohesive, with a strong conceptual core and stylistic confidence; the story lingers in the mind, though it leans more on mood than plot resolution.</comment>
