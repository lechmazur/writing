<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Morrigan is vividly drawn with consistent motivations and a distinctive personality; her obsession with soil patterns and solitude feels authentic and quietly compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot has a contemplative arc and satisfying cyclicality, but lacks dynamic tension or change that would elevate the narrative beyond atmospheric observation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The unusual setting of a giant’s boot and the integration of agricultural radio chatter create a strong, immersive atmosphere that supports the protagonist’s eccentric mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolism (the whip, the boot) enhance the poetic tone, but the story remains more meditative than emotionally resonant or thematically profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effectively original in setting and mood with fresh metaphor (e.g., whip as serpent), though some repetition and slightly mechanical transitions hold it back from full distinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, unusually textured story with creative integration of elements and a memorable protagonist, though lacking a moment of true transformation or narrative urgency.</comment>
