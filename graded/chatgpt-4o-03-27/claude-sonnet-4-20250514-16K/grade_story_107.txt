<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s arc from stranded host to reluctant guardian is nuanced and believable; the "strangely always" phrase, though occasionally forced, adds dimension, and his motivation aligns compellingly with his past persona and current burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story maintains narrative cohesion with a clear beginning, middle, and transformative end; some transitions (fever to meeting Elena) are abrupt but serviceable within the limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The insect amphitheater and atmospheric soundscapes are richly evocative, deeply enhancing tone and theme; sensory immersion is a major strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors ("bitter honey," "sweetest poison") elevate the prose; the subtext around fame, fate, and stewardship adds depth, though a slightly clearer resolution would heighten impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling avoids clichés with fresh imagery and emotional nuance; the symbolism of the crystal and insects feels organic, not imposed, though one or two phrases flirt with over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece is cohesive, inventive, and resonant; while not flawless, it demonstrates literary ambition and emotional intelligence rare in flash fiction.</comment>
