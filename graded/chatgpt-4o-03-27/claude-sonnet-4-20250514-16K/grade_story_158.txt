<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bernadette’s personality—optimistic and politely chaotic—is clearly established and consistently reflected in her actions, from addressing ice formations to transmitting warnings; however, more backstory or interaction could further deepen her psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative has a coherent arc driven by Bernadette’s mission to warn her sister, and it concludes with thematic resonance; still, the high-concept metaphysics slightly obscure causality at moments, risking interpretive ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with ethereal sensory details enhancing mood and the metaphysical tone; frost patterns, light-tears, and unnamable colors all contribute to a vivid, haunting atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong literary craftsmanship with compelling metaphors and poetic prose; the story conveys existential dread and hope with nuance, though some phrases veer close to overwrought or obscure abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, blending speculative science with lyrical surrealism; while a few abstract references could benefit from grounding, the concept is refreshingly novel and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>This is a cohesive, imaginative piece with strong thematic unity, inventive use of elements, and lingering emotional depth; minor overindulgences in language slightly temper its overall clarity.</comment>
