<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias has a strong personality and consistent motivation, but the voice is somewhat distant, lacking the emotional depth or complexity expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a strong arc, but some transitions (e.g., from fog to control of the crowd) feel too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is imaginative and tonally consistent, and the fog imagery is vivid, though some atmospheric elements (like tactile sensations) could be richer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story is cleverly constructed with thematic depth and subtle worldbuilding, but lacks emotional resonance or moral ambiguity that would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inventive in premise, but much of the writing and some metaphors feel slightly mechanical or derivative, with moments of generic phrasing and overly neat resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tightly structured and imaginative, with satisfying integration of elements, though not quite transcending genre into literary excellence.</comment>
