<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arc is complete and coherent with a strong cause-and-effect chain; the transition from failure to improvisation flows naturally without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally satisfying, and cohesive; most elements are integrated naturally, though some (e.g., "chalkboard notes") feel incidental.</comment>
