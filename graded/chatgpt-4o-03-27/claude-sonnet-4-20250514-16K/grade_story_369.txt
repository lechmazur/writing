<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magnus is distinct and psychologically rich; his obsession with puzzles and “optimistically bitter” nature are well intertwined with his motivations, though his arc edges on thematic rather than dynamic development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The structure is clear and coherent with a compelling arc—beginning with anticipation, building mystery, and ending in revelation. However, the climax feels slightly more suggestive than conclusive, leaving a subtle gap in narrative closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vividly evoked and metaphorically resonant; sensory detail and tone amplify the mood. The atmosphere is immersive and reinforces the thematic weight of isolation and discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong literary craft—symbolism (string, maze), metaphor ("secrets like barnacles") and tone reinforce emotional and thematic depth. Ending is suggestively powerful but not fully earned in terms of emotional catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stylish and avoids AI cliché with fresh images and emotional nuance. A few phrases verge on the ornate, but overall tone and originality remain intact. The metaphors and setting integrate well into the narrative's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegant integration of elements with a cohesive voice; the story feels like a deliberate narrative rather than a constrained exercise. Leaves the reader with contemplation while maintaining narrative unity.</comment>
