<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Joaquín is rendered with subtle complexity—his steady nature, inherited role, and emotional connection to tradition are all well-integrated and drive his actions plausibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot unfolds in a tight, satisfying arc with clear cause-effect relationships, a strong inciting incident (María’s confession), and a poetic resolution; only slight contrivance in the confession's catalyst detracts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout strength—rich sensory details (copal, marigolds, whispering wind) and a layered setting unify past and present smoothly, evoking vivid immersion and tonal coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story evokes reverence and melancholy with elegant metaphors and subtextual commentary on cultural erasure and restitution; emotional resonance is strong, though dialogue is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Language is mostly fresh and specific, with original metaphors and consistent tone; a few phrasings approach over-ornateness, and the ending slightly teeters on predictable redemptive closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between character, setting, and concept creates a compelling, literary narrative; the story lingers through its theme and atmosphere, meeting high editorial standards.</comment>
