<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kenji's inner life is richly rendered—his motivations are deeply tied to memory, ritual, and unspoken affection—but Yuki remains distant, limiting the emotional reciprocity essential to fully realized character interplay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete and elegant arc within the limit, gracefully connecting past and present; however, the culmination risks subtlety overriding narrative tension, leaving resolution overly understated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, poetic, and emotionally resonant piece that honors its brevity with clarity and nuance; minor risk of thematic repetition diminishes momentum slightly.</comment>
