<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina is a clearly motivated, emotionally resonant character whose loneliness and yearning shape every action she takes; her voice and moral clarity drive the narrative, though a bit more internal conflict would deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and emotionally complete within the word limit, with logical progression from setup to resolution, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax and leaves minor connective gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is deeply immersive and tonally aligned with the story’s themes; strong sensory detail supports both the villa’s ancient setting and the ghostly phenomena, enhancing mood and emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative prose, striking imagery, and layered metaphor (ghosts as analogues for digital-era disconnection) give the story emotional depth; the ending is satisfying and thematically cohesive, though slightly more subtextual subtlety could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite flirting with familiar tropes (ghosts, digital loneliness), the execution is original and the metaphors fresh; occasional over-formality slightly betrays a crafted rather than lived voice, but emotional nuance predominates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly constructed and thematically rich, the story’s components are in strong alignment and produce an emotionally resonant whole, though its literary ambition slightly exceeds its word count’s ability to fully develop every facet.</comment>
