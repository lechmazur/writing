<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyra is vividly drawn with consistent, compelling motivation; her recklessness, secrecy, and symbolic attachment to the compass enrich her arc, though her emotional evolution remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story arc is tight and coherent with a strong beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant ending; the override action logically drives the story, though the leap from polaroid DNA to neural essence strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through tactile detail, and the contrast of sterile lab with relics of the past enhances tone and theme; setting and timeframe are deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical layering and narrative voice foster emotional impact; the compass as symbol and the theme of directionlessness are well executed, although resolution remains more poetic than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality is high with fresh metaphor (e.g., “navigator lost between worlds”); minor traces of stylized phrasing and occasional over-formality slightly hinder authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive, artistically ambitious, and thematically rich; the narrative’s compactness serves rather than restricts, leaving a haunting aftertaste—but it risks poetic abstraction over full emotional investment.</comment>
