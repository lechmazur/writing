<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marina's personality and motivations are clearly rendered and consistentâ€”her instincts, background, and actions align well. However, her emotional arc remains mostly implied rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tight and purposeful with a clear resolution, and the scavenger hunt structure supports the arc well. Some transitions between clues and discoveries feel slightly telescoped or overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The museum setting is vividly realized, and atmospheric elements like "dusty starlight" and gravity-defying skateboarding deepen tone and mood. The sensory world is tactile and supports the theme strongly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ending offers satisfying revelation and thematic resolution. Imagery and metaphor are effective, but tension and character interiority could be pushed further for deeper resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Inventive premise with a fresh blend of elements. Occasionally leans on slightly familiar genre beats, and some phrasing teeters on the stylized or overly smooth side.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong unity of form and theme; the short length feels deliberate, not truncated. The story resonates beyond the text, though slightly more character depth could elevate it to a higher echelon.</comment>
