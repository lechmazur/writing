<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenjiro is rendered with quiet depth—the transition from swordsman to sacred assembler is elegantly motivated, though his internal world could be slightly more individuated with a unique voice or tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves elegant circularity and cohesion within its tight frame; the plot flows through symbolic action rather than conventional conflict, which suits the tone but might feel too diffuse for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and textured, with Neo-Tokyo’s recycling center brought to life through sensory detail and symbolic resonance; setting and tone interlock seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic and layered, the story evokes reflection and emotion through symbolism and subtext; the mandala metaphor and the pottery’s warmth are especially resonant, though some may find the resolution almost too subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story resists formula—its blend of mysticism, futurism, and ritual feels fresh, with metaphors that are sharp and specific; only occasional abstraction slightly dulls impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, graceful whole where elements cohere into a meditative reflection on creation and renewal; the story lingers emotionally and conceptually, despite eschewing overt conflict.</comment>
