<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena is a well-developed, emotionally resonant character with clear motivation tied to her sculptor’s struggle; her actions and reflections align with her creative transformation arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot flows logically with a satisfying arc of inner realization, but the central "action" remains largely internal and lacks external tension, slightly muting narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocatively rendered with tactile and visual detail—bones, bark, tent shadows—and it supports both theme and emotional resonance exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story employs rich metaphor and symbolism, especially around the puzzle ring and fossil imagery; the resolution is thoughtful though slightly introspective-heavy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>There’s genuine emotion and originality, though a few metaphor choices come close to overwriting; still, the voice and concept feel human, not templated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and mature in theme, with organic integration of elements and emotional payoff; a few moments edge toward abstraction but overall very strong.</comment>
