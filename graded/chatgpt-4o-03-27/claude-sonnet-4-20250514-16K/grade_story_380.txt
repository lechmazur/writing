<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira’s internal conflict is compelling and her fractured identity is richly explored, though her motivations (especially the thunder) verge on symbolic abstraction rather than concrete clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and structurally sound despite the surreal tone, but the leap from inner reflection to physical plunge feels abrupt and slightly under-earned as climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive; the post-human silence, decaying treehouse, and gray sky all reinforce the desolate, introspective tone with sensory precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is thematically resonant and poetically rendered, with strong symbolic weight and memorable language, though occasionally teetering on the edge of overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Extremely original and emotionally textured; minimal cliché present, and metaphors are inventive. Slight lapses into vagueness detract from full clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A layered, thought-provoking piece with emotional and thematic gravity; all elements serve the narrative, though the symbolism may alienate some readers seeking plot-driven clarity.</comment>
