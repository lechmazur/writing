<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc with clear cause-and-effect; the pacing is tight and deliberate, but the final combustion sequence feels just slightly rushed given its symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive, with thematic complexity and emotional weight that linger; a few transitions could be smoothed for even greater clarity and elegance.</comment>
