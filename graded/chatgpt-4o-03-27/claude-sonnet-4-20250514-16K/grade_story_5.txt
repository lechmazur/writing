<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe is evocatively drawn with a consistent intellectual voice and a distinct emotional restraint that aligns with her guarded apothecary role; her motivation to preserve wisdom through morally ambiguous means is well-integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stylistically mature, thematically cohesive, and emotionally resonant with originality in concept execution; not flawless, but nearly publication-ready.</comment>
