<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miriam's internal conflict and gradual shift from inherited ritual to personal conviction is convincingly drawn; her stage fright adds believable vulnerability, though some development feels condensed due to space constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story arc—crisis, confrontation, resolution—is satisfyingly compact yet impactful; the transition from ritual to authenticity is logical and emotionally resonant, though the key-turn moment feels slightly under-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with visceral use of zero gravity and debris; tone aligns well with emotional stakes, and the setting meaningfully reinforces the themes of detritus and legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional control of tone and theme; metaphor and subtext elevate the central conflict beyond genre norms, and the final note of transformation feels earned and poignant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and strong conceptual execution suggest human authorship; a few phrases (e.g., "drifting debris of ancestors' falsehoods") verge on overused imagery but overall feel specific and deliberate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive; assigned elements serve narrative rather than burden it, and the story lingers through emotional and thematic resonance well beyond its word count.</comment>
