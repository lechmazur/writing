<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within its word limit, using the misplaced letter to initiate introspection and resolution; one or two transitions feel slightly lyrical over logical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphorical lens on redemption avoids cliché, with emotionally specific imagery and a distinctive tone; only slight signs of familiar exile/redemption tropes persist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, elegant fusion of elements, and emotional depth create a compelling whole; easily publishable with minor refinement for peak literary polish.</comment>
