<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is distinct, layered, and internally consistent; his guilt ties across lifetimes, and his actions—especially in placing the toy soldier—organically emerge from his arc; his voice is strong and unique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a compact, coherent arc—from a quiet quest for absolution to a moment of release—but the central conflict arrives late and relies heavily on exposition via setting rather than event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten recipe library and the storm create a vivid, offbeat atmosphere; sensory detail and metaphysical layering elevate the setting beyond mere backdrop—it feels integral to tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story masterfully weaves metaphor, symbolism, and subtext around guilt and transformation; the final gesture with the toy soldier resonates, and the prose is stylistically bold yet controlled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original metaphorical framework with little reliance on genre crutches or clichés; the goldfish motif and reincarnation are familiar but handled with quirky inventiveness and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is thematically resonant, emotionally textured, and stylistically coherent; it uses its brief length purposefully rather than restrictively, though a slightly stronger middle beat would improve flow.</comment>
