<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira is sharply drawn; her backstory, motivations, and transformation are compelling and consistent. Her quiet resolve, tied to personal and cultural betrayal, credibly drives every action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc and uses its limited space efficiently, with clear stakes and escalation. Some transitions (e.g., split of suspicious strangers) feel narratively convenient but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sensory immersion—herbs masking electronics, tea as ritual—builds a vivid, layered world. The vault’s oppressive atmosphere contrasts beautifully with Mira’s subversive warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose, strong symbolism (tea, rivers, seeds), and emotional resonance drive a quiet but powerful revolution narrative. The climax subtly delivers a satisfying thematic payoff.</comment>
