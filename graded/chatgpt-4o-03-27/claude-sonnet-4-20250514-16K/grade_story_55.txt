<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra's backstory and motivation are compelling, her emotional arc from exile to purpose is clear, though her transformation could benefit from more nuance beyond regret and redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc is tight and elegant within word limits, with a satisfying sense of purpose driving the plot; pacing is strong, but the final revelation could gain from sharper narrative tension earlier on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imaginative and immersive, with sensory cues (light, silence, architecture) effectively enhancing mood and theme; the emotional resonance of place is particularly strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poetic prose, strong thematic cohesion, and understated symbolism elevate storytelling; slightly heavy-handed with exposition in a few places, but lyrical craft mostly enhances rather than overwhelms.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and evocative detail suggest originality, though a few phrases verge on conceptual vagueness or try too hard; the story avoids clich√©s but occasionally flirts with over-stylization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and complete, with a satisfying arc and emotional payoff; its brevity feels deliberate, though the balance between lyricism and clarity could be slightly better managed.</comment>
