<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivations—rooted in academic rejection and personal redemption—are compelling and consistently portrayed, with her actions (memorizing letters, returning to the reef) aligning organically; her personality shines through nuance, though a touch more dialogue or interaction could heighten dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is elegant and complete within the word limit, with a clear emotional progression; the final resolution feels earned, though plot momentum relies heavily on introspection over dramatic action, which may slightly dull tension for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisitely immersive setting—the coral station, bioluminescence, and vintage elements cohere masterfully with Maya’s emotional state; sensory language artfully reinforces the atmosphere and motifs of healing and remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The metaphor-rich prose, poetic cadence, and emotional resonance are exceptional, revealing subtextual layers around identity, forgiveness, and transformation; the subtlety of theme and imagery merges with craft for lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Language is lyrical without tipping into purple prose, and emotional beats feel earned rather than stated; a few metaphors veer close to the overly familiar, but the voice remains distinct and deftly human throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant, cohesive, and emotionally layered—each assigned element serves the narrative without feeling artificial; limitations of length are transformed into a strength by the structural economy and thematic clarity.</comment>
