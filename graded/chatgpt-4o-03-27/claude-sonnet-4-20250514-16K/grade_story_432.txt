<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot arc is clear and concludes effectively under the word limit, but the ritual’s mechanics and cause-effect pacing verge on abstraction and reduce tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A strong, cohesive story with poetic resonance and atmospheric richness; creative use of elements, though not all are fully integrated or essential to narrative momentum.</comment>
