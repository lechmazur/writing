<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mayaâ€™s character arc is clear and emotionally compelling, evolving plausibly from isolation to engagement; her motivation, rooted in connection, aligns well with her actions and transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc with effective pacing and resolution; however, transitions between memory, realization, and action feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered, with sensory detail and strong atmosphere that supports theme and character; the neon-soaked, rooftop orchard juxtaposes nature and cyberpunk effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story delivers a touching message with strong symbolism (the key, the orchard); subtext around systemic neglect and human connection is well-executed, though prose sometimes verges on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong originality in concept and execution; while a few phrases risk feeling slightly polished or programmed, emotional nuance and metaphor remain human and fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Overall, an evocative, well-structured short story with meaningful emotional and thematic payoff; a few moments feel narratively neat, but the piece lingers memorably.</comment>
