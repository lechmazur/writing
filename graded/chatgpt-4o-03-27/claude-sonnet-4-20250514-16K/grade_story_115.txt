<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kiraâ€™s emotional arc is strong, with motivation clearly rooted in her history with Vex; her growth unfolds naturally through action and memory, though some nuance in her internal conflict could go deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and satisfying within the word count, but the climax unfolds a bit too smoothly; some friction or complication in the reassembly process would heighten dramatic payoff.</comment>
