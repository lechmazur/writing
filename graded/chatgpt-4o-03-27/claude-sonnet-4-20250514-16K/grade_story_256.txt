<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus is subtly drawn, with internal tension around duty vs. aspiration; however, his motivations are more thematic than psychological, lacking emotional specificity that would deepen reader investment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arc is present and concludes decisively, but the story leans on poetic abstraction over narrative logic; transitions are smooth yet donâ€™t fully satisfy plot-level causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The surreal world is vivid and immersive, with strong sensory metaphors; the setting enhances mood and theme, though at times emotional texture overshadows practical clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor and subtext with a poetic rhythm, but the emotional payoff is slightly diluted by over-reliance on lyrical ambiguity; symbolism is compelling yet could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and evocative, with thoughtful thematic unity; imaginative conceptually, but literary polish occasionally veers toward abstraction at the cost of emotional immediacy.</comment>
