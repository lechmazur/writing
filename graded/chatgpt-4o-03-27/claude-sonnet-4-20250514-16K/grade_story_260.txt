<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Professor Eldridge is compelling and consistent—his cryptic crossword obsession believably underpins his methodical rewriting, and his redemptive drive feels genuine, though his inner conflict could be further explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story progresses with a clear arc—action is logical, pacing effective, and the ending is emotionally resonant; however, more tangible narrative tension would deepen engagement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong originality and mostly fresh metaphors, though some phrasing ("noble chaos," "starless sky") skirts the line of purple prose and could be more grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, beautifully crafted piece that lingers in the mind with its redemptive theme, though slight tonal refinement could elevate it to flawless.</comment>
