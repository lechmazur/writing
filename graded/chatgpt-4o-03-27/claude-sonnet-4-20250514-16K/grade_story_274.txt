<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The characterization of Vera, a sentient houseplant, is surprisingly rich and layered, with deeply felt but wordless emotions driving her transformation; motivations are coherent and compelling given the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot flows smoothly and cohesively, with a clear arc from bond to breaking point to redemptive return; the plantâ€™s journey mirrors a classic emotional trajectory despite the surrealism.</comment>
