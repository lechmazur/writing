<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s internal conflict is vivid and emotionally authentic; his evolution from envy to wonder is well-motivated and subtly portrayed through his interaction with others and symbolic use of the ruler.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story’s arc is clear and well-contained within the word limit, with a beginning rooted in self-doubt, a middle discovery, and a cathartic resolution; however, the plot shift hinging on a fingerprint feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting—a cathedral-like beehive—is richly imagined and metaphorically resonant, enhancing both the mood and the thematic underpinnings of human connection and rediscovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbolism, metaphor, and emotional subtext are used powerfully, and the central theme of rediscovered human connection is conveyed with poetic restraint; however, occasional exposition weakens some emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and formulaic phrasing; its metaphors are original and purposeful, though a few transitions verge on overly literary abstraction that may hint at performative depth rather than emotional necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thought-provoking, with strong interplay between elements; the lingering emotional and philosophical resonance elevates it to near top-tier, despite minor narrative convenience.</comment>
