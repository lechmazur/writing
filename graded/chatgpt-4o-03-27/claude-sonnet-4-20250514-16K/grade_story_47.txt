<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena is deeply realized, with motivations, traits, and behaviors that cohere into a compelling arc; her jaded resolve and personal connection to sleight-of-hand lend authenticity and depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-structured with a clear mystery-to-reveal progression, though the climax edges toward theatricality, slightly pushing plausibility within the tone set.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Complex themes are harmonized with plot, tone, and setting; the story feels intentionally brief rather than constrained—and leaves a resonant impact.</comment>
