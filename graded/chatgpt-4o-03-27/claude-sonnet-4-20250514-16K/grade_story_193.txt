<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aldric is compelling and emotionally resonant; his motivations are clearly linked to his exile and loneliness, and his transformation is well-earned though secondary characters could be developed more.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong with a clear beginning, middle, and end; pacing is mostly effective, though the resolution teeters on the edge of feeling conveniently symbolic rather than fully earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through sensory detail—the storm, the abandoned customs office, the tactile use of tools—creating a setting that enhances theme and emotion organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story effectively balances emotional resonance with literary craft; themes of isolation and destiny are subtly layered, and the symbolism of tools, weather, and healing are thoughtfully orchestrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the premise leans on familiar tropes, it refreshes them through lyrical prose and thematic introspection; language occasionally skirts purple, but remains controlled and purposeful overall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive, emotionally satisfying, with a meaningful thematic arc; crafted with discipline within the word count, though risks a touch of over-sentimentality in closure.</comment>
