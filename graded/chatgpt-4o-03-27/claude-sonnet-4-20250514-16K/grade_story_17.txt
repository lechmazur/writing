<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn with consistent internal conflict and layered nuance; his guilt and drive for redemption are compelling and align with his actions, though a slight increase in emotional texture would deepen immersion further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story arc is clear and cohesive, with a solid emotional climax and resolution; however, the shift from mystery-solving to self-reflection feels slightly abrupt in pacing and could benefit from a transitional moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive, with strong sensory details; the eerie yet introspective tone of the witch’s chamber and morning light is evocative and supports the character’s arc well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original and specific in its blending of profession and mysticism; avoids clichés, though the monologue-heavy introspection edges toward predictability in parts without new insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A haunting and quietly powerful story with thematic cohesion; highly effective within its brevity, though just shy of transcendent due to occasional tonal overbalance.</comment>
