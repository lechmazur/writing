<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is strong, with her motivations and reactions aligning well with her soft-spoken yet driven nature; however, the partner remains underdeveloped, and Maya’s emotional arc could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc with purposeful structure and escalation; the blackout effectively catalyzes the climax, though some transitions (like reaching the vest’s activation) feel slightly rushed or convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imaginative and immersive, blending sensory cues and atmospheric tone with finesse to support the eerie, majestic mood and heighten tension during the blackout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative prose and strong use of metaphor (e.g., “scream of silent plains”) enhance emotional resonance and theme; the ending is memorable though leans slightly toward telling over showing in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original concept and imagery elevate the narrative, though occasional overwriting and poetic abstraction verge on purple prose; largely avoids formulaic plotting or clichéd emotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of surreal setting, scientific wonder, and emotional tension creates a cohesive, lingering story; slightly marred by minor exposition dumps and occasional narrative strain.</comment>
