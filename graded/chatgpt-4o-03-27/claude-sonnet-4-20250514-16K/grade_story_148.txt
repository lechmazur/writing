<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is a well-developed character with consistent motivations rooted in emotional trauma and memory; his internal struggle is mirrored in his actions and reflections, though his distinct 'voice' could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is clean and emotionally progressive, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. There’s tight cohesion between setup and resolution, though transitions could be more surprising.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The alpine setting and atmospheric sensory details are vivid and immersive, enhancing both mood and thematic development powerfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant with strong symbolic layers (carousel, tongs, storms), though some moments lean toward telling rather than showing; minimal dialogue weakens tension slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Generally avoids cliché and feels humanly authentic, but a few lines near the end verge on sentimental convention rather than fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unifies all elements with emotional clarity and narrative elegance; ends on a resonant, earned note of catharsis that justifies its brevity.</comment>
