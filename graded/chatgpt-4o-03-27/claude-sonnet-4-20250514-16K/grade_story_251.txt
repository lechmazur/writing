<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Zara's contradictory personality—bashful arrogance, happily sad—adds intrigue, but her internal conflict and transformation could benefit from sharper emotional escalation or clearer stakes driving her hesitation and ultimate choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story builds to a satisfying moment of change, and the cause-effect chain mostly holds, but some beats feel slightly abstract or symbol-heavy, occasionally obscuring narrative clarity with too much metaphorical layering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lunar colony is sketched with a compelling sense of isolation and otherworldliness; the artificial moonlight and humming machines help establish tone, though more sensory specificity would further enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and emotional tone; the cracked marbles and puzzle edges symbolize deeper themes effectively, and the resolution feels meaningful—though a touch more tension or ambiguity could elevate impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece harmonizes its elements with impressive unity, embracing poetic logic over strict realism; not flawless in momentum, but conceptually rich and emotionally cohesive at a high artistic level.</comment>
