<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is sharply defined; his calm exterior hides a calculating mind, and his motivations are consistent with his past as a soldier turned observer—though an extra layer of emotional complexity would elevate the realism further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story reveals a strong arc within the word count, surprising the reader with a sinister twist that recontextualizes earlier details, though a minor uptick in pacing would refine its flow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and confidently literary with few signs of formulaic construction; metaphors like the nail marker are original and layered, and the piece subverts expectations while avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Creative, tightly woven, and thematically dense, the story elegantly combines setting, mood, and twist—but a touch more unpredictability in its conclusion would elevate it to perfection.</comment>
