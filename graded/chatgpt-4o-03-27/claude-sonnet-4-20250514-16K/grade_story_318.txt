<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara is somewhat distinctive with a strong emotional arc, but her 'aloofness' is underdeveloped and her transformation is overly neat given the complexity of the conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Well-contained arc with a clear beginning, middle, and emotional resolution, though the progression feels slightly too smooth for the stakes involved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and tactile, with the memory crystal library and spoon symbolism well-integrated into mood and meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s, and the spoon's emotional weight is uniquely handled, though some emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherence and thematic unity are strong; a few phrases verge on abstraction but overall leaves emotional and intellectual impact.</comment>
