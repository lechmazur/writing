<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Melody's motivation is deeply tied to her personality and role as a "slapdash bard," and her arc—from desperation to transformative defiance—is well executed and emotionally resonant, though her voice remains somewhat distant without deeper interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong cause-effect structure with a symbolic and satisfying arc; the action of disrupting the sacred tradition flows logically and climaxes meaningfully, though the cosmic elements challenge clarity at points.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The surreal tectonic setting and imagery-rich atmosphere amplify the emotional and thematic stakes; excellent use of sensory metaphors and cosmic aesthetics to evoke tension and wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism and emotional resonance, especially in the hourglass motif and final transformation; occasional abstract language slightly clouds impact but doesn’t undercut the craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Displays strong originality and cohesion of metaphor and theme; the writing avoids clichés and shows fresh language, though some repetition of motifs (e.g., hourglass imagery) edges near excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is well-sculpted with impressive cohesion and imaginative depth; the brevity feels deliberate, though a few transitions verge on ornamental abstraction over precise clarity.</comment>
