<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya is distinct and internally consistent, with her quietly loud personality, detached demeanor, and curiosity all feeding naturally into her role; Marcus is less developed, but serves the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story arcs cleanly from mystery to resolution, but the infiltration and underground world feel a bit compressed and under-explored within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and hauntingly textured—abandoned base, mess hall, tunnels, and glitchy digital hauntings blend into a vivid noir-like mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Well-crafted with memorable imagery and thematic resonance around ghosts of the digital age, but ending resolution is a hair too tidy and fast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh concept and voice, though a few lines veer into stylistic cliché ("feeding her curiosity with life's raw edge") that dilute overall originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inventive premise executed with restraint and cohesion; despite minor compression, it leaves a lasting impression and thematic depth.</comment>
