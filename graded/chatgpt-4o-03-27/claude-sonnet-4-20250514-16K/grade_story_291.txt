<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara is rendered with striking clarity; her motivations are consistent and layered, especially through her symbolic interaction with the rope, but a touch more dialogue or internal conflict would deepen emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The internal journey through the maze mirrors a coherent trajectory—past to present to self-acceptance—though the narrative leans into introspection at the cost of external tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park and dying orchard evoke a haunting, immersive mood with rich sensory texture and metaphorical resonance tied tightly to the character's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor, symbolism, and resonant prose—deliberately poetic but controlled; the story lingers emotionally and thematically, though tension could be slightly more dynamic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original and emotionally grounded; the rope-as-memory metaphor and mirror maze metaphor both feel fresh, though some syntactic flourishes verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thematically elegant, with character, setting, and conflict harmonizing into a poignant whole; just shy of perfection due to slight thematic over-insistence.</comment>
