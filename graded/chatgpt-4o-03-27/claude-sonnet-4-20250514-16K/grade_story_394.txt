<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clearly articulated and rooted in personal legacy, with her actions and tools (bent fork, bow) consistently reflecting her internal struggle and compassion-driven goal; however, her emotional depth and ‘voice’ remain a touch abstract and distanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning, rising tension, and resolution, though transitions between mystical insights and action are sometimes abrupt, risking slight disconnection in pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and symbolically rich, with textured sensory detail (leaves, cracked floorboards, rusted fork) and tone that enhances the protagonist’s mission and internal conflict—immersive and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and original imagery support a resonant theme, though the emotional impact, while strong, is sometimes dulled by overly abstract phrasing and lack of concrete character interaction or dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While many symbols are fresh and metaphorically layered, the prose occasionally strays into slightly ornate or ritualistic language that can feel performative, detracting faintly from emotional authenticity and specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Well-balanced integration of assigned elements with a coherent arc and lingering resonance, though a slightly more grounded emotional tone and narrative clarity could elevate it to elite literary standard.</comment>
