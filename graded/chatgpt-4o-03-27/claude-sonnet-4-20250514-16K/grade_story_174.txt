<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kenji's motivations are clearly rooted in regret and longing, and his meticulous nature as a fireworks designer ties emotionally and intellectually to his quest; however, his personality remains largely implied, which slightly weakens depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure gracefully holds a compelling arc within the short form—beginning with discovery and culminating in catharsis; the transitions are smooth, and the pace is well-managed despite complex elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is rich and immersive, from the frost-veined windshield to the misted yet dry library; mood and sensory details effectively enhance both the character’s internal journey and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is emotionally stirring and thematically elegant, with layered metaphors (leaves, frost, memory); while slightly leaning on nostalgia, it mostly shows rather than tells and rewards re-reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Though metaphorically rich and purposefully lyrical, moments push toward ornate phrasing; originality is high, but a few emotional beats feel slightly idealized or simplified, risking sentimentality.</comment>
