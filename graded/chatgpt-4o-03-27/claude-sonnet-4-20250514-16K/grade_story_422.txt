<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character is vivid and distinctive, with her mutism, optimism, and relationship with Marvin forming a coherent psychological portrait; motivations are clear and consistent but family resolution feels a touch idealized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot arc is mostly effective and emotionally satisfying, but the resolution is perhaps too neat and thematically overexplained, softening its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is imaginative and evocative, especially the aurora-lit beach and dimension-hopping through a coffee sleeveâ€”setting and object are deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically rich; brilliant imagery and symbolism (weather-emotion metaphor), though some dialogue edges into overt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly inventive premise with refreshing metaphors and stylistic cohesion; however, emotional beats occasionally veer into sentimentality rather than subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Well-executed fusion of concept and setting with a strong emotional core; ending is a bit on-the-nose but the story lingers in memory due to its originality.</comment>
