<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are emotionally resonant and clearly tied to her grief and lineage; the oracle, while mostly silent, is effectively portrayed and her transformation is believable. Both characters are distinct within the short span.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>There is a well-defined arc with a beginning, middle, and emotionally satisfying end. Some transitions between scenes and actions feel a touch abstract, but the internal logic mostly holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating desert fortress, the dream catchers, and the sensory-rich descriptions create a strong, immersive atmosphere deeply entwined with the themes of memory and sorrow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully uses metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the plastic spoon, meteor stone), and the subtext of healing through connection is powerful. Emotional payoff is strong, though slightly heavy-handed in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of magical realism with familial grief is fresh and layered. A few phrases verge on overly lyrical, but overall, the story avoids AI tropes and presents a unique structure and emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Extremely cohesive and emotionally rich; all elements feel purposeful and interwoven. A lingering sense of thematic depth and originality elevates it beyond surface craft despite minor abstraction.</comment>
