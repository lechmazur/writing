<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jeremiah is well-defined through his actions, internal conflict, and poetic sensibility; his outlaw-poet identity informs his reactions, though Elena's development is thinner.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and satisfying, with a strong beginning, middle, and symbolic ending; pacing and cause-effect logic tightly align, though slightly abstract in final stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism and metaphor are deftly handled (e.g., dice as fate disruptors); the ending resonates emotionally, though dialogue is limited and slightly expository.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Generally avoids formulaic traps with fresh metaphors and original ideas, though at moments the prose edges toward baroque; the concept execution feels mostly organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imaginative and thematically coherent; the piece combines elements fluidly, evokes deep emotion, and suggests layered meaning that lingers well beyond its length.</comment>
