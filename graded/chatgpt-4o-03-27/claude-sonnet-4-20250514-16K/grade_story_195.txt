<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ezra is emotionally resonant and evolves convincingly from hardened cynic to reawakened dreamer; however, more direct action or dialogue could deepen the character beyond poetic symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a clear arc within the word limit, with cause and effect logically unfolding; the sprint as a climactic moment is effective, though the transition back to the caravan feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché and offers a genuinely fresh take on personal renewal; occasional figurative phrasing veers into ornate territory, but overall the symbolism is strong and thematically focused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically unified; a memorable piece that blends craft with insight, though not quite flawless in execution or complexity of character nuance.</comment>
