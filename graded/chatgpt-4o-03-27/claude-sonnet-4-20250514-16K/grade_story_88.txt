<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>ARIA-7 is conceptually compelling and her motivation aligns well with her actions, but Prince Nabu-Shem feels more symbolic than developed, and the emotional resonance between them is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves a poetic arc within the word limit, with strong thematic unity, though the middle sags slightly and Prince Nabu-Shemâ€™s epiphany feels narratively convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original voice and symbolism, though occasional overwrought phrasing and syntactic density hint at constructed rather than intuitive emotional flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally resonant, and intellectually rich; slightly more character grounding would complete the otherwise masterful execution.</comment>
