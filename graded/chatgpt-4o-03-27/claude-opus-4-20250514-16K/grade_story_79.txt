<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear and emotionally grounded, and her actions align with her rebellious intent; however, she lacks some interior complexity and distinctive dialogue or voice, limiting deeper dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story presents a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution; pacing is strong, though "tracing the path of falling stars" as a method feels metaphoric rather than plot-driving, slightly weakening causal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and atmospherically immersive, blending scientific surrealism with poetic mystique to amplify tone and plot; sensory detail is precise and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative effectively uses metaphor, tone, and symbolism to evoke mood and theme; the concept of silenced memory returned through sound is deeply moving, though a bit more subtextual layering would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong originality in concept and aesthetic, though some phrasing borders on ornate and could benefit from sharper restraint; metaphors largely feel fresh but occasionally tip toward abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Richly imagined and emotionally resonant; the story integrates elements well and offers a haunting, complete narrative that lingers, though minor polish to character depth or thematic integration could lift it to greatness.</comment>
