<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Martian biodome is vivid and immersive—twilight, dust-heavy bookshops, brass-etched memory objects—each element reinforces the isolation and eerie hope. Atmosphere coheres impeccably with tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical yet purposeful, with metaphors smartly tailored to character and setting.
