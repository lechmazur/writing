<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot arc has a clear beginning, transformation, and epiphany, but transitions between key moments (especially the climax) are slightly rushed and could be more organically developed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story avoids formula and shows originality in concept, but certain metaphors verge on overuse and shifts in tone can feel slightly mechanical or orchestrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and imaginative, the story leaves an impression, though stronger character depth and more grounded pacing would push it from compelling to unforgettable.</comment>
