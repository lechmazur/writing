<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus is highly compelling: a former corporate lawyer turned fugitive preserving dying languages. His motivation is clear, consistent, and complex, revealed through his symbolic actions and inner conflict. A few emotional beats feel slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story arc is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a strong midpoint and resolution. A clear progression from introspection to decision. Slightly too expositional near the middle, occasionally softening the forward momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The biodome's setting is richly imagined, with sensory detail and symbolism supporting the theme of unnatural preservation. The atmosphere enhances Marcus’s isolation and quiet purpose. Minor moments could use more concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story delivers lasting emotional and thematic resonance. It balances metaphor and meaning expertly, especially in the final paragraphs. Subtle, layered insight into cultural memory and accountability. Slight lack of dialogue reduces dramatic immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and generic phrasing. The language is elegant but restrained, and the metaphors (ghosts, morning glory, gift tag) are fresh and symbolically coherent. A few moments verge on overwritten introspection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive and haunting narrative that uses its constraints to deepen rather than limit its impact. Tightly woven elements, purposefully structured prose, and an emotionally resonant close. Achieves high literary merit with minimal exposition waste.</comment>
