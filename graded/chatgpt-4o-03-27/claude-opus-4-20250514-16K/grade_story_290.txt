<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kess is vividly rendered with a consistent motivation and distinctive voice; the tension between her boredom and revolutionary zeal adds depth, though the archaeologist is less fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc with a satisfying climax; the pacing is tight and purposeful, though the shift to alliance feels slightly convenient given the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and immersive—rain, harmonic caves, and strange relics evoke a fully realized world that feels alive and supports the narrative theme effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with every story element working toward a clear thematic and narrative goal; brief length feels deliberate and potent, not restrictive.</comment>
