<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's personality—introverted, methodical, emotionally cautious—is vividly established and consistently informs his actions, thoughts, and eventual shift, though the customer’s presence could be more richly used to reflect deeper contrast or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story features a clear arc, smoothly transitioning from internal stasis to revelation and subtle transformation, with strong cause/effect logic; the grandmother’s message is a pivotal and well-integrated turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The diner setting and late-night mood effectively underscore Marcus’s isolation; atmospheric touches like humming lights and chrome reflections are evocative, though the encrypted archive's physicality could be more vividly grounded.</comment>
