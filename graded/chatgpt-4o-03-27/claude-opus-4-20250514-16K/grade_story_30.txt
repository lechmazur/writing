<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera is distinct and complex—her philosophical pragmatism and emotional ties to family and heritage clearly drive her decisions; however, Korvash is somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution; however, transitions between memory, dialogue, and exposition are occasionally abrupt within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric—whispers, holographic stars, and tactile memory all evoke a mood of mysticism and high-stakes negotiation in deep space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and subtext—dragons as solar collectors, flame as nurturing; strong emotional resonance and thematic layering, though a touch more dialogue variety could elevate naturalism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original integration of all elements into a mythic sci-fi framework; metaphors are fresh, and tone is consistent without falling into purple prose or cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Compelling, emotionally textured, and cohesive; shows creative synthesis of disparate elements with a lingering thematic impact—rare at this length.</comment>
