<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivations are clear and rooted in empathy, and her actions consistently reflect her character. However, some emotional depth—beyond her compassion—feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fleeing sequence is well-paced and logically structured, with compelling cause-and-effect. The use of shadows as safe zones ties elegantly into the plot, though the resolution is a touch abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story blends all elements into a compact, emotionally charged arc with thematic coherence. Some polishing would elevate it to a top-tier publication standard.</comment>
