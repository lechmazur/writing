<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Margot is richly developed through dialogue, journal habits, and interaction with Bjorn; her motivations are internally consistent and deeply tied to her identity as a collector and seeker of solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot unfolds naturally within the constraints, offering a full arc with momentum; however, the invitation arrives late and doesn't significantly alter events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The frost giant’s lair is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail; the atmosphere aligns beautifully with the story’s meditative tone and themes of quiet resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story layers metaphor (despair as a predator), quiet humor, and subtle tension well; dialogue is efficient and character-revealing, though the thematic payoff is gentler than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Unusual conceit (frost giants, solitude, board games) handled with emotional nuance and subtle originality; style avoids cliché, and metaphors feel precise and fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive with layered themes and elegant use of assigned elements; it resonates emotionally and intellectually, though lacks a stronger narrative jolt.</comment>
