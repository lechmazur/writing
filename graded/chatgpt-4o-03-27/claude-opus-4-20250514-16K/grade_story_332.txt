<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief and transformation are convincingly portrayed with internal consistency; her motivation—resurrecting her daughter through art—is both original and emotionally grounded, though her "voice" remains more poetic than distinctively personalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story progresses with elegant inevitability from solitude to discovery to a clear resolution; pacing is strong and the arc complete, though some transitions verge on overly lyrical, slightly blurring plot clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden is lushly rendered with sensory and aesthetic detail that evokes a sense of wonder and heartbreak; the setting enhances thematic depth and mirrors the liminal themes of life, death, and art.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotionally evocative and skillfully layered with metaphor and symbolism; the story's poetic voice and thematic ambition elevate it, though the final emotional beat skirts sentimentality rather than pushing further into ambiguity or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative subverts a standard death-and-loss trope with dimensional transformation through art; while poetic and carefully crafted, some metaphors veer toward predictability or abstraction rather than tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly composed, emotionally resonant, and intellectually thematic; the combination of elements feels organic rather than assembled, with strong cohesion and lingering emotional impact.</comment>
