<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara is well-drawn, with consistent motivation and a voice that merges intellect and empathy; her actions align with her skillset and hint at deeper internal conflict, though Captain Vega remains underdeveloped as a foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves surprising completeness and clarity in limited space, with a strong arc from mystery to revelation; a few transitions into the memory sequences are abstract, risking brief disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered—blending sci-fi and poetic surrealism—while mood and sensory details (chipped dice, fading stars, quantum foam) amplify tension and atmosphere beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical yet controlled, using metaphor and subtext masterfully; the ending is subtly emotional, unforced, and thematically resonant, though dialogue is minimal and largely expository.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and elegant prose suggest genuine voice; emotion emerges through image and nuance, though moments like “ancestry’s mirror” skirt cliché and thematic repetition slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly integrates multiple elements with imagination and narrative economy; feels like a complete, deliberate short fiction piece, though complexity flirts with obscurity at times.</comment>
