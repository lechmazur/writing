<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is well-rendered with clear internal conflict, distinctive behavior, and consistent motivation rooted in guilt and a drive to comfort; his use of the tape dispenser and world-weariness add layered authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story builds a full arc with clarity and momentum despite the word limit; the séance structure drives the emotional logic and is resolved with resonance, though slightly reliant on exposition over escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dystopian farm is vividly evoked with sensory and emotional precision; the toxic twilight, pesticide floods, and withered crops blend atmosphere with character psychology beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emotional payoff is strong, bolstered by symbolic language and subtext about grief and deception; the prose is controlled and layered, with subtle irony and tragic empathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., the tape dispenser as conduit), believable emotional nuance, and non-generic voice elevate this well beyond cliché; minor moments veer close to over-description but recover quickly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotionally immersive, conceptually unified, and rich in character and theme; the piece manages both clarity and depth in a short span, with minor narrative shortcuts forgivable given overall cohesion and purpose.</comment>
