<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zara's guarded empathy is convincingly portrayed; her actions—reluctant but consistent—reveal depth and conflict rooted in hardship and code, making her emotionally coherent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cyberpunk night market is vividly and efficiently rendered with neon, grit, and atmosphere that reinforce the tone and character’s alienation, enhanced by tactile, sensory detail like the storm’s aftermath.</comment>
