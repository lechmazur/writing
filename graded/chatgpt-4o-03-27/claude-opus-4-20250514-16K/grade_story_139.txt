<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brother Aldric is well-drawn, with clear motivation rooted in grief and suspicion; his stubbornness and methodical nature are consistent, though some emotional depth is implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and complete within the word limit; the twist of the imposter is compelling and logically delivered, though the transition from dream to revelation could be slightly more fluid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive concept (decoding tooth marks as secret twin language) and fresh imagery illuminate the narrative; writing avoids clich√© and shows emotional nuance through specific detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive use of elements, strong central conflict, and layered symbolism make for a memorable narrative; slightly more emotional immediacy would elevate it further.</comment>
