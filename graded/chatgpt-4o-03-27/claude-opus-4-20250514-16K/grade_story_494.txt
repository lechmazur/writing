<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jian's transformation from arrogance to humility is sharply rendered and emotionally resonant; his guilt and love for his sister drive the narrative convincingly, though his sister remains more symbol than character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story arc is remarkably complete given the word constraints—strong setup, emotional climax, and resolution—all clearly linked by cause and effect, with a few minor pacing compressions near the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The courtyard setting, tactile imagery, and atmospheric tone evoke a serene but emotionally charged world; the use of mist, ink, and silence is especially effective in building mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich with symbolism (veil, song, darkness), the story evokes strong emotion and subtext through gesture and restraint, though Jian's final understanding flirts with being slightly overstated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original synergy of cultural motifs—calligraphy, swordsmanship, blindness, song—offers nuanced emotional depth and avoids cliché, though a touch more specificity in the sister’s portrayal would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive, moving, and artfully constructed, the story integrates its required elements organically and offers a satisfying emotional and thematic arc within a compressed form.</comment>
