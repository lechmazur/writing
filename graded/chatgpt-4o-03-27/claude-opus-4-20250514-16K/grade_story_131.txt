<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s emotional arc is clearly rendered, and her guardedness gives way to vulnerability in a believable progression; her actions reflect a coherent internal transformation, though there is room for sharper differentiation in her voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-contained and complete given the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, certain transitions (e.g., from discovery to epiphany) feel a touch rushed or metaphorically overloaded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is vividly imagined and consistently used to reinforce the story’s surreal, liminal atmosphere; sensory details enhance immersion while connecting place to theme and character growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The symbolic weight of the stones and Mira’s surrender is emotionally resonant; strong thematic unity and metaphoric coherence, though a bit more tension or specificity could deepen impact further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story avoids tropes and feels emotionally sincere; while there is slight poetic overreach in places, the originality of setting and metaphor largely counterbalance any formulaic lapses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A compelling, emotionally layered piece with clear intent and polish; while not flawless, it achieves a rare balance of grounded character work and surreal metaphor within its constraints.</comment>
