<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The archer’s motivation is noble and consistent, but her internal voice is underdeveloped—her passion, while referenced, feels abstract rather than embodied in her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is structurally coherent with a clear arc and resolution, though the climax is slightly rushed; connections between action and result are strong but could use more tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive—moonlight, ruins, and flickering light all contribute to a haunting, emotionally charged tone that enhances the narrative depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphor (e.g., swirling dust motes as memories) elevate the prose; the ending delivers emotional weight and thematic resonance, though stakes could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly creative and original interpretation of classic tropes; metaphors are fresh, and the execution avoids clichéd AI patterns—style feels intentional and human-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and artistic vision with a lingering thematic note; high literary merit, though slight detachment in character voice holds it back from perfection.</comment>
