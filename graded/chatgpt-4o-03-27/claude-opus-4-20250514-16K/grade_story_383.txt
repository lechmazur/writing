<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harrow’s arc is strikingly clear—burnt out, skeptical, then slowly awakening through the camera’s lens that reframes fear as absurd rather than rational. His voice is distinct, and his transformation feels believable and well earned, though slightly accelerated by narrative constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has a tight internal logic and satisfying arc despite limited space. The introduction of the camera provides narrative momentum and thematic depth. However, the resolution borders on tidy, given the philosophical weight of the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world-building is immersive and inventive, filled with cosmic, sensory, and emotional texture. Specifics like “seaweed from nebulae” and “liquid starlight” elevate the surreal diner into a believable emotional waystation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism—fear as arcs, a jester-king, the absurdity of reason. The imagery is compelling and layered. Dialogue contributes meaningfully, and the theme is clear but not heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original blend of high-concept sci-fi and emotional realism. Clear personal voice and fresh metaphors. Avoids AI-like patterns; emotions are nuanced, metaphors specific, and tropes are subverted with wit and subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally resonant. The elements of setting, character, and concept are well-integrated. Leaves the reader with questions about logic, fear, and wonder—an impression of something greater beyond the final line.</comment>
