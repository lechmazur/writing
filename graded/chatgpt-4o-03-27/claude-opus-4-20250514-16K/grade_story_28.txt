<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marisa's drive to preserve cultural memory is vivid and credible, and her evolution from hopeful recorder to determined archivist is emotionally resonant; however, her "sly" attribute is interpreted metaphorically and could be more textually grounded in action or behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is satisfyingly circular, beginning and ending with urgency and resolve; the action of recording ties tightly into the climax, though the pacing rushes toward the end under pressure from the word limit.</comment>
