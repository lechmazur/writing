<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cheerless duelist is rendered with strong internal consistency—her pride, isolation, and eventual shift toward healing are effectively linked, though her emotional transformation feels slightly compressed given the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc is coherent and emotionally resolved, with a satisfying shift from conflict to transformation, but the pacing between discovery and catharsis might benefit from more space to deepen tension before resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive; the sensory details (humming servers, pulsing ink, light from chrysalises) reinforce themes of liminality and metamorphosis beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism is rich and deft—the mutated recipes and chrysalises evoke emotional weight, though a few metaphors border on overwrought; overall, strong craft with a resonant thematic core.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original in combining dueling with alchemical recipe-forgiveness metaphors; voice and style are distinct though occasionally veer into lyrical excess that slightly detracts from emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally compelling, and stylistically cohesive—the story achieves narrative closure and leaves a lingering mood, though it is slightly constrained by its brevity in conveying deeper relational contexts.</comment>
