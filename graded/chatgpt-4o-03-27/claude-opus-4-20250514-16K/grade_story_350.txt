<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thalia is vividly sketched—her puppeteer’s past, tactile relationship with objects, and reflective solitude anchor her motivations; however, she remains emotionally distant, with minimal internal conflict or dynamic development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The transformation from puzzle to ritual is logically and stylistically coherent; the arc is complete and well-structured. Slight risk of over-abstraction may hinder immediate accessibility to the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple's atmosphere is immersive and supports the tone and themes masterfully; elegant sensory cues evoke silence, age, and ritual. Minor enhancement needed in sensory variety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor, symbolic layering, and subtext; the parallels between puppetry, ritual, and hidden knowledge are subtly powerful. The emotional impact is intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While some metaphors verge on ornate, the layered symbolism and originality of concept are rare and compelling; no obvious clichés or machine-patterned breaks, though occasional phrasing tilts toward poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with a clear, resonant theme and lingering emotional flavor. The constraints are used to the story’s advantage, though a touch more grounded tension could elevate the impact.</comment>
