<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character voice is strong and distinct; Morrigan’s fear of sound, ambivalence, and ritualistic instinct are well-established, though her transformation could use one more moment of interior clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is elegant and emotionally complete, but the shift from dread to resolution feels slightly compressed; the climactic chant resolves tension a bit too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen orchard is vividly rendered with rich, specific sensory detail; atmosphere mirrors Morrigan’s conflict beautifully and reinforces the mood with consistency and depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and poetic with layered symbolism (e.g. safety pin); the moment of song is cathartic and thematically coherent, though slightly more subtlety in the final lines might elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Generally avoids cliché with fresh metaphors and voice, though the “ghosts/spirits awaken to song” is familiar; subverted by tone and setting, but still borders on expected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, elegant integration of elements with literary finesse; memorable tone and beauty in language elevate it, though the theme is just shy of transcendent.</comment>
