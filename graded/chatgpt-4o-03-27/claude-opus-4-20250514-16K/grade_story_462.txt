<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal motivation—escaping mental confinement—is rendered with subtlety and insight, and her reactions reveal a consistent, complex psychology; however, some emotional beats hint at thematic overreach rather than organic growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story has a strong narrative arc with a clear emotional climax and resolution, but the ambiguity of certain transitions—like the sudden appearance of the stained glass—slightly disrupts logical flow despite lyrical momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story brims with layered symbolism and emotional subtext, and the prose is lyrical without tipping into excess; however, the final dialogue risks cliché and could benefit from more tonal restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, nuanced emotion, and vivid imagery elevate this beyond formula, though occasional phrases brush against overwrought abstraction and could be pared for clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with powerfully intertwined elements and a sophisticated emotional arc; the story lingers and provokes thought, though the stained glass could be more organically introduced.</comment>
