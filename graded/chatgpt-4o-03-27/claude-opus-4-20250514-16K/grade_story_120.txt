<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is surprisingly complete with a clear shift from futility to release; minor jumps in logic around the boy’s sudden recovery slightly blur causal coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece achieves uncommon depth in brief format, integrating theme, structure, and emotion seamlessly to deliver lasting impact.</comment>
