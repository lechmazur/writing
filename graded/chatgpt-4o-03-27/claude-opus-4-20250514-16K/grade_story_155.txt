<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina is textured and distinct, with her "patiently impatient" duality reflected in both her day job and secret actions; her motivations are clear and emotionally resonant, though her internal conflict could be more deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot flows coherently with a clear arc and satisfying resolution despite the brevity; the sequences of cause and effect mostly make sense, though the final mechanics of the crossing feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive; the broken planetarium repurposed as a nightclub is original, atmospheric, and symbolically resonant with the fractured timelines motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and subtext around generational legacy and time-as-medium enrich the narrative; the ending is poignant and thematically earned, but emotional stakes could be heightened slightly earlier.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impressive originality in integrating time manipulation, welding, and inheritance; metaphors are inventive and specific, though a few transitions hint at slight mechanical structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A rich, memorable piece with a unique premise, strong thematic unity, and vivid atmosphere; slightly more emotional depth or tension would elevate it to elite-tier status.</comment>
