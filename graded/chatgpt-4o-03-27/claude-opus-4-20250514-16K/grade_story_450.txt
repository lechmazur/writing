<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s characterization is rich and consistent—her linguistic struggle, physical intelligence, and inherited trauma all guide her actions plausibly; however, her internal motivation could be slightly more emotionally nuanced beyond the prophecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is remarkably coherent for its brevity, with a satisfying arc and well-executed twist; a few transitions verge on hazy due to abstract language, but the momentum never falters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The surreal, sensory-rich setting is evocative and thematically aligned; the chamber’s liminality and the photos' symbolism add deep atmospheric resonance to Marina’s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally potent and conceptually bold, the story uses physical movement as metaphor and plot mechanism, building to a revelatory crescendo that earns its philosophical weight; minor abstraction in places dilutes clarity slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imaginative synthesis of dance, prophecy, and generational memory; fresh metaphors and structural originality elevate it well above formula, though hints of stylistic overreach blur precision at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, vivid, and lingers meaningfully; its complex integration of theme, action, and setting is masterful, marred only by occasional opacity in prose.</comment>
