<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s "loudly introverted" nature is conveyed through her solitary journey and internal transformation, though her arc is slightly compressed by the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong cohesiveness and a clear arc from solitude to emotional catharsis; the CD and fireflies provide a coherent, symbolic throughline driving the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon cathedral, fog, and mechanical fireflies create an evocative, immersive post-human atmosphere that reinforces the story’s tone and separates it from cliché dystopias.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive metaphors ("neon tubes...forgotten prayers") and specific imagery outweigh a few slightly ornate phrasings; the perspective and voice feel distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The integration of tone, symbolism, pacing, and character arc forms a cohesive, emotionally satisfying whole that avoids formulaic beats and leaves a lasting impression.</comment>
