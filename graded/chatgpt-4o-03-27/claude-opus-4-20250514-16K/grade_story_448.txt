<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s distrust and cautious magic align with her past persecution and inform her actions throughout; however, while consistent and compelling, her change of heart at the climax feels slightly abrupt given the word count and her deep-seated isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot flows logically with a satisfying arc, well-paced within the word limit; the mechanical cue of the sewing machine stopping provides a strong narrative fulcrum, though the final transition could benefit from more emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The guild hall is richly textured, with atmospheric detail enhancing tone and mood; the integration of soot, machinery, and shell gives the setting both tactile immediacy and thematic resonance.</comment>
