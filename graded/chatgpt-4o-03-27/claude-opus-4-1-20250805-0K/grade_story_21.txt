<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chen's transformation is powerful, her motivations emotionally grounded and clearly drive the action; her arc is compelling, though slightly rushed near the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; pacing is strong, but some transitions (esp. the virus trap setup) feel slightly compressed within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and immersive—musty scents, broken windows, drum circles all create a textured, lived-in atmosphere that reinforces theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and thematic depth; elegant use of symbolism (fox tail, synthetic neurons) and an ending that lands with gravitas and poetic irony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and imagery fresh; a few phrases border on slightly over-ornate, but the originality in theme-texture integration far outweighs minor stylistic blemishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive; all elements—character, plot, setting, and theme—serve a larger purpose with emotional and intellectual weight; minor pacing tightening would elevate it further.</comment>
