<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lady Meridian’s motivation is clearly rooted in her telepathic pursuit of truth, with her actions aligning closely to her internal traits; the child is less developed, but effectively catalyzes Meridian’s transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story establishes a tight arc—awakening, confrontation with the lie, and resolution—without feeling rushed; some transitions are a bit smooth to the point of underexplaining, but the structure holds elegantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The steam-powered square, the bronze statue, and sensory-laced atmosphere cohere richly; the world is immersive and supports the narrative’s emotional tone and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant with layered symbolism (the statue, the hair tie, forged calligraphy); the ending delivers satisfying thematic reversal and resolution with restrained but potent imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in the central conceit and voice, though some phrasing leans toward poetic excess; the use of detail and metaphor largely avoids cliché and shows strong authorial intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements, emotionally weighty payoff, and stylistic consistency mark this as near-publishable; a few overly flowery moments slightly soften its otherwise strong clarity and cohesion.</comment>
