<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is both vividly drawn and drives the entire story; her mortician's demeanor informs her respectful yet transgressive actions. Her motivations are clear and consistent, though more depth on what personally compels her beyond professional frustration would add richness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc has strong cohesion and a satisfying progression, though some leaps (e.g., why mimicking a dance reveals journals) stretch internal logic slightly. The pacing is elegant and complete within the limit, with a resonant resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is lush, immersive, and deeply entwined with theme and mood. The mangrove labyrinth, spirit songs, and sensory details create a vivid world that enhances the plot without overwhelming it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>There is strong emotional and thematic resonance, with layered metaphors and a memorable concept. The use of literary devices is intentional and effective; only mild abstraction in logic prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original imagery and conceptual fusion (mortuary science + spirit dance) avoids cliché and formula. The voice is distinct and purposeful, with elegant phrasing that never tips into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels fully realized despite brevity, with all elements working in service of theme. It leaves a lingering impression of philosophical depth and emotional yearning, even if full clarity is elusive.</comment>
