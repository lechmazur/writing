<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Margot is well-rendered with a distinct personality—her poetic disposition and formal rebelliousness authentically inform her actions and motivations; her voice is clear throughout. Slightly more development of her emotional journey would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a strong internal logic and coherent arc within its word limit; the progression from letter to revelation to guardianship flows naturally. The resolution is poetic but slightly abstract, leaving a faint sense of incompleteness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmospheric depiction is exceptional—rich sensory detail and a haunting yet grounded world where ivy holds memory, time stands still, and the past whispers tangibly. The mood is immersive and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story elicits quiet reflection and uses metaphor and symbolism with grace. Themes of memory and resistance are layered without overt exposition. Its emotional core—loss, remembrance, and purpose—lands powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in tone and execution; avoids clichés and instead delivers fresh metaphors and purpose-driven language. Some phrases veer toward ornate, but overall this is deeply human and stylistically distinct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally resonant, and poetically crafted, the story weaves assigned elements into a compelling whole. A few minor ambiguities aside, it reads as a finished, memorable piece with lasting impact.</comment>
