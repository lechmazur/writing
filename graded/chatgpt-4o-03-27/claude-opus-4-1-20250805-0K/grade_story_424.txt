<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn, with a consistent voice and internal logic; his motivations—legacy, understanding sacrifice—align with his actions, though nuance in his emotional evolution could be deepened further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant arc from contemplation to decisive action; emotionally and thematically coherent, though the climax (rejection of investors) lands a touch softly given the philosophical buildup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, emotionally resonant, thematically rich; all elements intertwine gracefully, though slightly more narrative tension or surprise could heighten memorability.</comment>
