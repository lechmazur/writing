<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus’ emotional transformation is convincing and thematically integrated—his motivations trace a clear, believable arc from isolation to vulnerability, though the woman’s role borders on symbolic rather than fully developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc with clear emotional progression and cause-effect logic; however, the transition between theater, carnival hallucination, and return to reality is slightly abrupt at times, risking slight disorientation in the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and layered—the clock tower, phantom carnival, and theater cohere into a symbolic landscape that enhances the tone and theme without feeling overexplained; sensory detail is evocative without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and subtext—“the carnival only exists at near distance” encapsulates the central conflict with elegance; moments of dialogue feel lightly abstract but serve strong thematic resonance and emotional depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fresh metaphysical imagery and self-referential surrealism feel authorial rather than derivative; nothing feels templated or clichéd, and emotion is conveyed with subtlety rather than blunt exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An emotionally resonant and stylistically mature piece—compact yet complete; only minor clarity issues around transitions keep it from a perfect score.</comment>
