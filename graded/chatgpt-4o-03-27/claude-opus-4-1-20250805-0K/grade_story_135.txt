<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kess’s motivations are clearly rooted in her loyalty to linguistic preservation, and her actions—risking her life, crafting the straw, deciphering bruises—align with that. Distinct voice and internal logic are maintained, though further emotional depth would elevate it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Efficient arc within tight constraints; clear beginning, middle, and end. Stakes are well established. The Trial and Repository organically emerge from the plot, but some transitions, particularly to the poster discovery, feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and immersive, with exceptional sensory integration. The atmosphere of decay and frozen time mirrors the theme of linguistic preservation. Strong tonal consistency throughout, reinforcing mood and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Engages intellectually and emotionally through rich metaphor (language as entropy resistance). The storytelling avoids exposition dumps, using tactile and auditory imagery effectively. Resolution is subtle but satisfying; central conflict clearly defined.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally original integration of elements—no clichés, rich metaphor, and inventive world. Language is expressive but rarely overwrought. A few lines verge on ornate, but most details feel organic and thematically appropriate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>All elements work harmoniously; nothing feels tacked on. Style is confident and distinct, and thematic resonance lingers. The brevity feels purposeful, with dense, poetic economy of language supporting narrative depth.</comment>
