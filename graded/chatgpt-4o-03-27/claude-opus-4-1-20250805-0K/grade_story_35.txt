<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—rooted in silence, memory, and emotional fluency—is deeply coherent and compelling, with her actions and inner world interwoven beautifully; still, her arc is more reflective than transformational.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story loops elegantly from discovery to emotional resolution, maintaining thematic coherence; while it lacks overt conflict, the internal arc is subtly effective, though the climax is emotionally diffuse rather than sharply defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting—both literal (rooftop garden, translation center) and metaphoric—is richly imagined and layered with symbolism; sensory details like birdcalls and plant textures create a meditative, immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotionally evocative with resonant symbolism (seed, ravens, silence)—the poetic prose and thematic unity shine, though some images drift toward abstraction and could use grounding for greater impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imagery and voice feel distinctive and organic, not generic or formulaic; a few moments edge into poetic overreach, but overall the emotional nuance and conceptual freshness elevate the piece above convention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A thematically cohesive meditation on language, memory, and longing—crafted with care and subtle innovation; it doesn't quite reach universality or narrative perfection, but it lingers meaningfully.</comment>
