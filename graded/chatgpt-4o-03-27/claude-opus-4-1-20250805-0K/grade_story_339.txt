<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina is a fully realized character; her motivations and internal conflict are layered and her guilt subtly informs all aspects of her behavior, voice, and decision-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and emotionally satisfying, though the exact sequence of the theft and its aftermath could be more economically structured; the pacing is deliberate but on the edge of overextended.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is rich and symbolic—the prismatic lake and construction site mirror her shifting emotional state and internal rebuilding; excellent atmospheric control throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s emotional gravity, poetic imagery, and symbolism (e.g., seesaw, drawer knob) are expertly rendered; it evokes reflection without overstating theme, and the closing lines resonate deeply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotion is conveyed with nuance, imagery is fresh, and clichés are avoided; while voice is strong, a few phrasings border on overly literary affectation rather than authentic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant, resonant, and filled with quiet emotional power; the story integrates all elements organically and leaves a lasting impression without feeling confined by length.</comment>
