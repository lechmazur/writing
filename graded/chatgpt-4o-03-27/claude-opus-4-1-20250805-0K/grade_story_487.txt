<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnus is deeply characterized through contrast—his bulk and gentleness, intellect and emotional restraint—with his motivations emerging poignantly through the baton’s legacy and his mother’s fate; still, he verges on archetypal, slightly limiting complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure builds momentum with clear rising action and a transformational climax, ending in a haunting emotional resolution; however, some transitions (e.g., from Morse drumming to corpse-flower reveal) feel slightly rushed or overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is viscerally rendered with multisensory detail—whispers, stench, acidity—blending the grotesque and lyrical to powerful effect; the surreal atmosphere supports theme and tone remarkably well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor, mythic resonance, and poetic imagery, the story evokes sorrow, awe, and transformation without exposition; emotional beats are well-earned through carefully embedded symbolism and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh concept with nuanced use of emotion-as-language and a unique twist on resurrection myths; a few phrases flirt with purple prose, but overall the language is vivid and precise, avoiding AI clichés.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally persuasive tale that blends character, mythos, and setting with striking originality—its brevity feels like a deliberate, effective constraint rather than a limitation.</comment>
