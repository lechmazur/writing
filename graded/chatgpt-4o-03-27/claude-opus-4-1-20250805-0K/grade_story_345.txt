<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly rendered through introspective prose, and his transformation feels authentic—his confusion is not just stated but embodied in how he engages with the world; his motivation unfolds organically, though a touch more emotional range would enhance depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is abstract but coherent; Marcus's journey is internal, yet mirrored in the external labyrinth. Some transitions feel poetic over functional, slightly muddying causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is haunting and layered, with sensory details and metaphor richly enhancing theme and mood; the bean stalks and snow construct a surreal but immersive world fully aligned with the story’s metaphysical ambitions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Literary devices and symbolism are skillfully employed, particularly around the abacus and snow. The ending feels earned and contemplative. Occasionally verges on over-explaining its metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking originality in imagery and concept—bean stalk mythology meets sacred geometry is inventive. Some phrasing slightly overwrought, but largely avoids AI-generic pitfalls; voice and style are consistent and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Holistically cohesive and emotionally resonant. The assigned elements integrate unusually well. A few moments of heavy metaphor slow clarity, but overall the story succeeds in its literary ambitions.</comment>
