<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marcus is vivid and consistent, his bitter humor and lingering guilt grounded in rich internal logic; the emotional shift feels earned, though Dr. Chen could use more depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete within the word count, with a clear emotional turn and satisfying resolution; the weather-as-catalyst feels slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice and clever concept execution; the goldfish caretaker idea feels fresh, with strong metaphorical integration and human nuance—nothing feels templated or AI-generated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and poignant; each element serves the story’s emotional arc without excess, leaving a lasting impression without overreaching its scope.</comment>
