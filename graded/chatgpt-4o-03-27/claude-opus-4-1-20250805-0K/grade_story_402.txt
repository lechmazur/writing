<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Baron's evolution from isolated survivalist to committed archivist feels believable and thematically resonant, though his identity as a “Baron” is underdeveloped and contributes little to his motivation or psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a full arc with a clear shift in purpose, anchored by the discovery of the archive and Baron's decision; pacing and transitions are smooth, though the raft subplot is only lightly tethered to the main thread.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional resonance, layered symbolism, and a contemplative tone; the use of imagery and metaphor is restrained but effective, and the ending feels earned and thematically satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Demonstrates originality in concept and integration, though a few phrasings ("luminous doubt") veer toward the overly poetic; overall, avoids cliché and maintains narrative discipline.</comment>
