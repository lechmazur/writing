<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marlowe’s character is consistently portrayed through subtle actions and memory; her transformation feels earned though her emotional interior could be deepened further for maximal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is elegantly self-contained and thematically coherent, though the transition from physical weaving to metaphysical awakening flirts with abstraction that slightly softens narrative tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stylistic voice is original, metaphors are fresh, and tropes are subverted with sincerity; shows emotional depth rather than telling, though a few lines risk excess ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, inventive, and emotionally resonant within tight constraints; the story lingers thoughtfully, though the metaphysical leap could use marginal grounding for ultimate clarity.</comment>
