<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot threads—vault as sanctuary, cultural reconnection, analog rebellion—are well-woven and coherent, achieving a complete arc within the tight word count, though the climax could carry more singular tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative narrative where all elements serve the theme; brief yet expansive, leaving behind emotional and intellectual echoes with remarkable economy of prose.</comment>
