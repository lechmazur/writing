<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s character is richly motivated and consistent, with his rejection of corporate telepathy aligning with his intellectual and philosophical quest; small details like his milk-steaming inefficiency reinforce his traits subtly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative is tightly coherent with a clear arc—from Marcus’s quiet purpose to his moment of epiphany—though resolution edges on abstract and could benefit from stronger plot-driven tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and uniquely atmospheric; sensory detail and metaphor build a grounded yet metaphysical tone perfectly suited to the theme of hidden knowledge in mundane places.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor and subtext with a strong emotional and intellectual impact; the glacier-as-memory structure motif is both poetic and conceptually striking, though some moments veer close to over-narration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative is highly original with fresh metaphors and a distinctive narrative voice; the idea of weather as distributed memory is compellingly strange in the best way, though one or two transitions feel slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An imaginative, emotionally resonant micro-narrative that feels complete despite its brevity and cleverly integrates disparate elements into a cohesive artistic vision.</comment>
