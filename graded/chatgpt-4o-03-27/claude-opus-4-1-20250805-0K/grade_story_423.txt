<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aldric is subtly but clearly motivated by lineage, tradition, and memory; his emotional response to the greenhouse and the inscription enriches his development, though his 'earnestness' could be explored with greater complexity or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong structural cohesion and resolution within tight constraints; the celestial alignment driving plot progression is elegant and purposeful, though the path from discovery to denouement is perhaps too clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is textured and immersive—sunlight, sand, ruin, and memory interlace beautifully with the setting’s decay and latent hope; sensory materials are deployed with restraint and depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic prose, thematic resonance, and emotional payoff are all strong, but metaphor occasionally verges on overuse, and the ending, while satisfying, lacks true surprise or risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Several moments are highly original in imagery and structure (e.g., star-holes in the ceiling), though some metaphors and emotional beats err toward safe or familiar territory typical of genre-fantasy hybrids.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically controlled; every element feels necessary, though some edges could be sharpened for a more lasting impression.</comment>
