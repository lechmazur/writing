<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s heretical stubbornness and emotional drive are clear and consistent, anchored by the teddy bear and the promise to his sister; his voice is distinct, though his emotional growth could be more dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a strong arc and uses the constraints well—beginning, revelation, and transformation are all clearly tied; the pacing is swift but generally effective, though the climax could be slightly more earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setup feels fresh, and most symbols avoid cliché, though some lines flirt with preciousness or mildly predictable metaphor; emotional complexity and voice are largely authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The integration of theme, character motive, and setting is strong and memorable; minor polish in pacing and dialogue would raise it to top-tier publication standard.</comment>
