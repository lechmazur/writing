<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a complete arc—her discovery, decision, and sacrifice form a tight emotional loop—but pacing feels slightly rushed at the climax, where the broadcast and painting occur nearly simultaneously.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The exo-atmospheric garden, zero-gravity roses, and Earth-as-pearl imagery form a poetic and immersive world that enhances the story’s melancholic tone and thematic focus on disconnection and fragile beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates subtle literary mastery—powerful symbolism, emotional subtext, and a final image that lingers. Ending is poignant, though slightly abstract in its execution.</comment>
