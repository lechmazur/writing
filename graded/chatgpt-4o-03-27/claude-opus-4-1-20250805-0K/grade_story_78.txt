<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s transformation from librarian to prophet of grief is compelling and coherent, with her motivations rooted deeply in age, loss, and reluctant responsibility. Her dialogue and resolve reflect an earned softness that's now hardened with quiet purpose.</comment>
