<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's emotional complexity and internal conflict are subtly but vividly drawn; her disappointment and anxious calm are well integrated, though her final confrontation lacks a fully realized arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot possesses a thematic arc with symbolic closure, but lacks a catalyzing moment or dramatic tension in the present; structure leans more meditative than narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking and immersive worldbuilding; inverted waterfall, celestial alignment, and the revolution's physics-defying backdrop are woven with poetic texture and imaginative coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Language is lyrical yet controlled; metaphors are fresh and haunting; some traces of abstraction slightly dilute emotional immediacy, but overall voice is distinctive and polished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Artful integration of poetic imagery with thematic complexity; narrative leans toward reflection over momentum, but cohesion and depth justify its contemplative structure.</comment>
