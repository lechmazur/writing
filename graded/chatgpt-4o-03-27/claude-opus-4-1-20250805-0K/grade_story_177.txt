<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara is a vividly drawn character with a compelling internal motivation—her role as obituary writer for the living is psychologically rich and metaphorically resonant, though her emotional arc might have benefitted from deeper grounding across such a surreal landscape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear arc within the word count, from her quest to the climax of manifestation and identity shift; pacing is brisk but purposeful, though the resolution verges on being slightly too abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is strikingly original and immersive—the giant’s bookshelf, cathedral-sized books, and swirling dust-motes build a surreal yet cohesive atmosphere that elevates the theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story conjures striking imagery, deep metaphor, and emotional resonance; the organ scene is particularly memorable. Slightly more subtextual nuance in the ending would bring it to perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Language is precise yet lyrical without tipping into purple prose; the metaphor of obituary-as-creation is layered and fresh. The surrealism is well-contained, with few signs of formulaic phrasing or AI convolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Each element serves the narrative's deeper theme, and the whole piece retains clarity and unity despite its density—leaving the reader with a sense of wonder and subtle introspection.</comment>
