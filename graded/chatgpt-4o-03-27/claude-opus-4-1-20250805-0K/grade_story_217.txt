<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's character is richly developed through her actions, environment, and dialogue, with her motivation to awaken wonder in Daniel aligning seamlessly with her background; however, Daniel is more of a symbol than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a self-contained arc with a symbolic resolution, though pacing is slightly uneven near the transition from tension to climax; the developer thread feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric, richly layered with sensory detail and metaphor; the funhouse mirrors and salvaged parts reflect the characters' inner landscapes and enhance tone powerfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphor and emotional resonance, especially in the final beat; writing is lyrical but purposefully grounded, though symbolism occasionally leans close to being overt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking originality in concept and motif (culinary intimacy in a ruined funhouse), though some metaphors walk the line between evocative and slightly over-stylized; mostly avoids tropes and formulaic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative shaped by strong themes and well-integrated elements, though some tertiary threads (like the phone call about developers) feel slightly ornamental.</comment>
