<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is clear and sustained, with her ordinariness contrasting powerfully against her cosmic ambition; however, emotional nuance is somewhat abstracted by the elevated prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arc is elegantly contained within the word limit, with a clear transformation and resolution; minor ambiguity in cause-effect doesn’t fully hinder clarity but slightly mutes narrative propulsion.</comment>
