<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivations are clear, emotionally grounded, and consistent, with strong symbolic use of the clothespin; however, her arc slightly lacks deeper psychological complexity or unexpected nuance that would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot has satisfying progression and resolution within constraints, and the storm-forced detour is well-executed, though the transition into the seed vault discovery could benefit from tighter causality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story impressively integrates all elements into a cohesive whole with poetic tone and sustained thematic depth; not flawless, but very near top-tier readiness.</comment>
