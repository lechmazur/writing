<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dr. Collective and Torres are distinct, their dialogue and behaviors revealing layered motivations—the former fragmented but composed, the latter unraveling but driven. Torres's reaction to the plug is especially telling, yet his personal arc could be deepened slightly for a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc is coherent and compelling: a conversation preluding an experiment, anchored by evocative symbols. Cause and effect are mostly logical, but the pacing verges on cryptic, slightly hindering narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—wax-coded messages, fractured time, and subtle dread coalesce within a surreal yet tactile setting. Sensory details are sparing but intentional, supporting the theme of fractured identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor, symbolism, and restraint converge to deliver emotional and thematic resonance. The candle, the plug, and hindsight weave together in layers of subtext. Dialogue is sharp, though resolution leans abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high—the concept of a hive-mind therapist recording future-coded sessions with wax is inventive. Emotion is shown through imagery and subtle cues, though a few abstract phrases weaken precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tightly woven and thematically ambitious, the story delivers more than its length suggests. Complex ideas are handled with surprising clarity, though accessibility suffers slightly due to dense metaphoric execution.</comment>
