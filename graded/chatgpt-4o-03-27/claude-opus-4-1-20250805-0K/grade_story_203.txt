<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s characterization is mostly successful—her stage fright informs her method and emotional journey, and her inner conflict is well-aligned with the inheritance theme—though her voice could be a touch more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent, tightly structured within the word limit, and culminates in a satisfying resolution. The action is logically paced and cause-effect is mostly seamless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Well-balanced and evocative; every element feels purposeful. Lingers with emotional weight and symbolic cohesion—just shy of perfection due to slightly underdefined voice.</comment>
