<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The watchman's motivations and personality are richly implied through his ritualistic behavior and connection to Grimwald; lacking only slightly in interpersonal contrast or development arcs but well-drawn within the reflective frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is conceptually complete and thematically resonant, though its structure leans more atmospheric than driven; minor risk of stasis over evolution in the middle stretch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is immersive and poetically rendered, with sensory and symbolic elements harmonizing elegantly—the sailor's graveyard is both literal and metaphorical terrain, beautifully executed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The symbolism of knots, yarn, and economic metaphysics is arresting and fresh; strong control over rhythm and tone but lacks minor emotional dynamism or character friction to fully elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impressively original in metaphor and fusion of commercial and esoteric motifs—“market wisdom” mystified through divination is inventive; language occasionally skirts purple but mostly avoids formula.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive, lyrical, and conceptually bold; while slow-burning, it lingers after reading and displays voice, control, and unexpected thematic synthesis of commerce and cosmology.</comment>
