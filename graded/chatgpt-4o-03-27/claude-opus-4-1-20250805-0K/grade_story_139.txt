<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's stubbornness is skillfully woven into both plot and resolution, and his motivations—rooted in guilt, redemption, and spiritual duty—are clear and compelling; however, the story could afford slightly deeper emotional nuance to elevate his arc further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot unfolds coherently with a strong arc and satisfying resolution; the parallel gondola and dream-premonition create a compelling temporal structure, though a few transitions could be slightly smoother.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Employs strong symbolism (flute, tooth marks, shipping label prayer), effective metaphor, and a satisfying subversion of expectations; slightly more emotional resonance or vulnerability would deepen the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Conceptually inventive with layered metaphysics and thematic inversions; some phrasing teeters on the edge of being overly ornate but mostly avoids predictability or cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A creative, emotionally intelligent story rich in texture and subtext; while very strong, minor stylistic tightening could achieve even greater clarity and depth.</comment>
