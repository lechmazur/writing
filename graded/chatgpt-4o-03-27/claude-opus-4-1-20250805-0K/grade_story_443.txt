<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The reaper’s sorrow and weariness are convincingly rendered through evocative description and symbolic action. Her transformation is emotionally resonant, though some of the emotional transition feels idealized rather than complicated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a poetic but coherent narrative arc, moving elegantly from descent to discovery to rebirth. Cause and effect are subtly implied, yet clear. The emotional logic holds even as the literal logic bends toward metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is immersive, richly sensory, and symbolically aligned with the narrative—limestone, moss, flower-light, all support the themes of memory, decay, and renewal. Atmosphere heightens emotion without overwhelming it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emotionally powerful with effective metaphor and layered symbolism; the story invites reflection on mortality, memory, and creation. The final image lingers. Minor risk of overwrought phrasing in places, but nearly always justified by tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and motif integration. A few moments flirt with poetic excess or archetypal abstraction, but the inventive symbolism and emotional specificity elevate it above genre convention or AI mimicry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant interplay between theme, character, and setting; the story feels deliberately crafted not constrained. It leaves a lasting impression and exhibits literary ambition with polish.</comment>
