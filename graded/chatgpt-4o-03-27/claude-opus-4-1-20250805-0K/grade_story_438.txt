<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's motivations are emotionally grounded and consistent, her actions directly tied to her character's backstory and psychological state; her voice is compelling, though her arc could benefit from more complexity or interpersonal tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot builds with clarity and resolution within the word limit, with a satisfying arc; however, transitions feel slightly too smooth, and stakes, while present, remain largely internal and could be heightened.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lab environment is richly imagined with vivid sensory detail, effectively merging science and mysticism; the atmosphere supports tone and character motivation, though expanded external interaction would deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors, layered symbolism, and a resonant final image elevate the narrative; subtext about memory, inheritance, and ambition is strong, with a deft use of showing over telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original blend of speculative science and mysticism with specific, non-generic imagery; language is purposefully stylized but avoids purple prose, though one or two phrases veer close to over-description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong cohesion with creative integration of theme, setting, and tone; story lingers with thematic depth and poetic resonance, though a touch more narrative tension would enhance memorability.</comment>
