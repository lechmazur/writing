<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grimaldi’s character is vividly drawn through unique details and contradiction—his absurd yet effective logic, his jester’s garb, and his reverence for ritual make his motivations distinctive and organic to the world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc is coherent and satisfying within the word limit—establishing stakes, deepening the world, and culminating in a meaningful transformation; minor pacing compression in the resolution slightly mutes impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—sensory detail (bells, steam pipes, copper bowl) builds a setting that feels both symbolic and tangible; the submarine as sanctuary is powerfully rendered.</comment>
