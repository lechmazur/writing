<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization of Mordecai is poignant and textured—his arc from repression to catharsis is emotionally credible, with consistent voice and motivation; Thessaly functions more as a catalyst but adds thematic depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional arc and internal logic; plot progresses naturally from mystery to revelation to quiet resolution, though the pacing leans slightly on poetic tempo over narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric setting of the crystal scrying room and starlit mandala is evocative and immersive, supporting mood and theme without over-description; sensory details transport.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant prose with rich symbolism (names as ghosts, mandala as psyche); themes of grief and transformation are handled with subtlety and resonance; emotional payoff is real.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and purple prose; metaphors are fresh and integrated, though some transitions risk a faintly lyrical sameness that flirts with formulaic rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poised, mature piece with a fully rendered emotional shift; compact while feeling complete, and lingers with cathartic weight—ready for top-tier consideration with minimal polish.</comment>
