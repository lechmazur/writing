<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus is clearly motivated by his moral code, which comes through in both internal reflection and action; his distinct ritual with tea and signature hacking precision adds texture, but emotional depth remains slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc with tight pacing; the retrieval of Serviliaâ€™s name drives the narrative with purpose, and the ending provides resolution, though some elements (like anonymity of her followers) could be more fully integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The reimagined Forum Boarium is vividly portrayed with rich sensory details; the fusion of ancient Rome and digital archaeology is immersive and thematically relevant, enhancing atmosphere and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, with elegant use of metaphor (e.g., artifacts as memory carriers); the ending is powerful and meaningful with subtext that lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh concept executed with originality; minor phrasing ("confident uncertainty") borders on trope, but overall the narrative avoids formulaic patterns and engages with nuance and specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story blends its elements into a cohesive whole with literary precision; its brevity feels intentional, and the message endures after reading, despite a slightly neat moral resolution.</comment>
