<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is compelling, with clear motivation rooted in emotional stakes; his backstory as a clerk becomes meaningful in an elegant way, though some of his internal voice and transformation could be more deeply rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story delivers a coherent arc with deft pacing and a satisfying conclusion; the trajectory from trivia night to harvesting a cure is logically presented, though some transitions, particularly in dimensional shifts, could be slightly more grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The undersea greenhouse is vividly imagined and atmospherically rich, with sensory cues (bioluminescence, water pressure, shimmer) supporting the sense of fragile, interdimensional liminality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact through metaphorical resonance (mail clerk as reality sorter); excellent use of thematic and symbolic layering, though some phrasings verge on over-explanation rather than letting subtext breathe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of philately, quantum theory, and emotional stakes; a few moments feel slightly too polished or conceptually dense, hinting at engineered rather than organic voice, but overall strikingly inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, resonant, and layered with meaning; each element serves the narrative with purpose, and the story lingers afterwards, though a slightly more daring tonal risk might elevate it further.</comment>
