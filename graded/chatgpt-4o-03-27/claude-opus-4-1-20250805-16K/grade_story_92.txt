<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivations are subtly rendered through action and subtext; his “carefully careless” behavior aligns with his fear and underlying empathy. Mrs. Blackwood also conveys depth, though more internal conflict or ambiguity could heighten complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story presents a coherent arc with effective pacing and a deliberate beginning, middle, and haunting close. The blood drive anchor could be more integrated across the narrative for full cohesion, but overall structure is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere—details like fading amber light, frost-bitten windows, and shadowless servants establish a deeply immersive, gothic tone that enhances both mood and tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Powerful mood, deft use of symbolism (e.g., pressed flowers of death), and elegant subtext elevate the narrative. A few lines verge on melodrama, but overall the storytelling is emotionally rich and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and specific imagery avoid genre clichés, though one or two phrasings feel overly stylistic. Narrative voice is distinctive and cohesive, reflecting human nuance and restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A darkly lyrical, self-contained narrative with emotional depth, atmospheric precision, and thematic clarity. Slight tightening of conceptual integration (notably the blood drive) could push it higher.</comment>
