<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jack’s personality and motivation are clearly conveyed through action and voice, and his defiance is rooted in an authentic sense of subversive purpose; secondary characters are less developed but functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tight, with a clear arc, effective rising tension, and a satisfying twist. Cause and effect are well-executed, and pacing within the word limit is expertly managed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and layered symbolism (roses, diary, confessions); compelling emotional arc and ending, though slightly more depth in subtext would push it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inventive premise with fresh imagery and voice; some elements could risk trope familiarity, but overall the narrative avoids predictability through clever integration and subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, stylistically assured, and emotionally resonant within a tight space. Creative blending of elements enhances rather than distracts. Memorable and thematically rich.</comment>
