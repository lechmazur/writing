<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is a vividly rendered character—his fanatical dedication to puzzles, grief-stricken solitude, and conflicted hope make his motivations credible and deeply human. His reactions are nuanced, and his internal logic consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, progressing clearly from mystery to emotional revelation. The puzzle deliveries anchor the structure well. The only minor critique is the slightly abrupt shift into the metaphysical at the end, though it remains earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is rich, immersive, and thematically potent—the lighthouse's isolation, the lethargic sea, and the tactile details all reinforce Elias’s internal state. The atmosphere amplifies both tension and melancholy beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story leaves emotional resonance through symbolism and metaphor (e.g., the string, the rotating beam). The writing is elegant but purposeful, and the reflection on grief and communication is layered and poignant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Aside from occasional flirtation with familiar tropes (e.g., mysterious letters), the treatment is original, intimate, and emotionally nuanced. Imagery like “salt crystals” and “mechanical spider” feels both fresh and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful, the story weaves its elements with care and restraint. It’s a quiet, literate piece that achieves depth without overstatement, and it lingers meaningfully after the last line.</comment>
