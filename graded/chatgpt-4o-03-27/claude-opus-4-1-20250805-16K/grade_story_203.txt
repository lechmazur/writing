<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation and internal conflict are clear, and her stage fright adds dimension, though more specificity in her character arc or distinct voice could elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a beginning, conflict, climax, and resolution—all within a short span; a few beats feel slightly compressed but overall flow is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with poetic sensory detail and a haunting, atmospheric tone that enhances both tension and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism (flowers, toy birds, starlight), layered with emotional resonance and thematic subtext; dialogue is minimal but purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original blend of space opera and spiritual horror; rich use of specific, fresh imagery avoids clichés and formulaic AI hallmarks, though one or two phrasings verge on poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally potent, the piece integrates all elements cohesively and lingers through its final image; an excellent model for flash with literary ambition.</comment>
