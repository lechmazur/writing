<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mage's internal conflict and mannerisms are well-drawn, with his purposeful aimlessness aligning with his quiet desperation. His interaction with the child deepens his humanity and motivation, though his history remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with a clear arc from mystery to revelation, and the pacing remains tight. Some leaps in logic—particularly the transition from the coffin fragment to multiversal greenhouses—strain coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse is vividly rendered, its sensory contrasts (heat/cold, plants/ice, laughter/dread) enhancing the surreal mood. The setting is integral to tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism and metaphor are rich and layered, particularly around cultivation and mirrors. The ending resonates emotionally. Dialogue is minimal but impactful. Subtext is strong if enigmatic at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh and specific—"compressed time," “growing futures from seeds of the past.” Some phrases risk veering into purple prose, but mostly language is controlled and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story feels complete and deliberate despite its brevity, with layered meaning supporting a strong emotional undercurrent. The concept’s ambition nearly overwhelms the structure but largely succeeds.</comment>
