<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus is a compelling, emotionally layered character with a clear arc—from haunted guardian to cosmic voyager—but his motivations, while resonant, could use slightly more grounding in decision-making detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story has a strong internal logic and ends with emotional closure, though the transition from memory-haunted realism to cosmic fantasy is abrupt and could be more smoothly integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, with sensory detail and surreal imagery enhancing both setting and tone—setting is fully integrated into mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly lyrical and evocative; the symbolism is meaningful, and the central metaphor (protector vs. transformation) lands, though parts verge on overly ornate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While largely original in tone and metaphor, some imagery ("cotton candy laced with lightning") is borderline purple; emotional nuance largely avoids cliché but just skirts the edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Achieves thematic resonance and narrative cohesion; vivid, poetic prose sustains emotional impact, though some metaphors feel slightly overworked.</comment>
