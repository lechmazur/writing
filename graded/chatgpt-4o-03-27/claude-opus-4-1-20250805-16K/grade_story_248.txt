<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc is compelling and emotionally resonant—the transformation from bitter exile to self-sacrificing guardian is clear and aligns with her established traits. Her motivations are well-rooted in the betrayal she suffered, and her reactions uncover deeper facets of her personality. Minimal dialogue, but voice is distinct through internal narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong structural arc within a limited word count, with coherent cause-effect chains and a satisfying resolution.

Its meditation on memory, agency, and martyrdom enriches its speculative premise beyond genre tropes.</comment>
