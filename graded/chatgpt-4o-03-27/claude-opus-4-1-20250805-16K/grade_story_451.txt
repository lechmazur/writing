<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena’s motivations are deeply entwined with the prophecy and her quest for identity; using actors as extensions of fractured selves was rich and inventive, though her emotional arc could be more sharply defined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is surprisingly coherent and complete given the complexity; the buildup to the twist is well-paced, though some transitions (e.g., from market to summit) could flow more smoothly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered—the crystalline summit, singing warnings, and hidden cave build a compelling world that enhances the mood and aligns closely with theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism in the baseball and fractured identities; emotional resonance is strong, though some metaphors verge on overwrought; the ending lands thematically but could deepen its human element slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive concept handled with finesse—twist was fresh and not formulaic; a few descriptions tilt toward the ornate, but emotional nuance and voice remain distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive, original, and emotionally compelling; its brevity feels elegant rather than limiting—lingering questions about identity and unity add depth beyond surface.</comment>
