<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is subtly well-drawn—her quiet persistence and analytical nature are clear, and her motivations align smoothly with her past and actions, though her emotional depth could be pushed further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is impressively complete given the word limit, with clear stakes and a satisfying resolution; the pacing is tight and cause-effect logic is strong, though one or two transitions feel slightly too convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly evocative; the control tower, the rain, and the after-party detritus contribute to a vivid sensory experience that enhances tone, theme, and character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story strikes a compelling balance of imagery, theme, and subtext, with poetic metaphors and strong emotional resonance; dialogue is minimal but effective, though the resolution feels a touch too clean.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original concept and craft—clever use of poetic environmental logic (rain unlocking data), and no cliché or formulaic phrasing; tone and imagery feel fresh and deliberate throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally resonant, and built from its elements rather than constrained by them; its brevity feels intentional, not deficient—an elegant, small-scale triumph.</comment>
