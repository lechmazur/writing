<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Itzel is vividly rendered with consistent motivations, a strong voice, and a deeply rooted sense of purpose; Carlos’s arc is compact but effective, though slightly rushed as secondary character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a surprising amount of structural coherence and narrative depth in few words; the shift from mystery to revelation is fluid, though the ending skirts resolution slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric layering of ancient and modern—conch shells, diesel, marigold, and obsidian—creates a stunning sensory world that carries both tone and theme seamlessly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Impressively original fusion of speculative elements and cultural detail; vocabulary and metaphor are specific and purposeful, avoiding cliché or artificiality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A near-publishable work that weaves ancient cosmology with modern caretaking in a unique voice; needs only slight sharpening to reach the highest tier.</comment>
