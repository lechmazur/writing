<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira is sharply defined through her contradictions—an underwater explorer afraid of small spaces, a scientist who tastes emotions in jam. Her motivations and actions cohere beautifully, though secondary characters remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story has a distinct arc and emotional resolution, but its structure leans heavily on atmosphere over causality. While cause and effect are metaphorically logical, the narrative lacks traditional conflict escalation.</comment>
