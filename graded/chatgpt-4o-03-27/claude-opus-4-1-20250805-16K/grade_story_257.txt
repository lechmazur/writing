<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and evocative—autumn air, thrifted postcards, dusty chalk, and fireflies create a wistful, tactile world that reinforces the story’s themes and tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensitive use of metaphor and symbolism (chalk dust, postcards, light) support a resonant theme about belief and reinvention; the cathartic climax and understated prose elevate the story’s impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements work in service of a cohesive, emotionally layered story that achieves depth and elegance in under 500 words; it leaves a lasting impression without resorting to sentimentality.</comment>
