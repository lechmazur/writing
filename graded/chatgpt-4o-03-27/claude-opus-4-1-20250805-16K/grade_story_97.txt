<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera’s transformation is emotionally coherent and nuanced, with her shift from logic to empathy convincingly portrayed; however, the 'desperately casual' attribute is under-explored in her behavior beyond one mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story maintains an elegant arc within tight constraints—beginning with fracture, continuing through emotional retracing, and resolving in newfound balance—though a few transitions verge on impressionistic abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The unstable dimension is rendered with vivid metaphor and internal logic that mirror Vera’s inner turbulence; immersive, emotionally resonant world-building enhances theme and mood.</comment>
