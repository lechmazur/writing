<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's fading cognition and former glory as a memory athlete shape her actions and motivations effectively, with the corn husk and origami swan symbolically echoing her fragmented identity; however, her 'voice' could be more distinct to deepen emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story delivers a coherent arc with a metaphysical transformation resolving the protagonist’s goal, though the abstract layering of events occasionally strains clarity and dampens causal precision.</comment>
