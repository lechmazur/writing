<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story moves with a quiet but deliberate arc—from mission onset to emotional revelation to transformative resolution—though the folk remedy mission itself feels underutilized in driving dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich subtext and symbolism elevate the narrative; the mitten as a motif bridges lost innocence with reclaimed humanity, and the final line strikes an emotionally potent, satisfying end; metaphor and sensory craft are strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotion is nuanced and shown, not told; metaphorical language feels organic; minor moments veer toward the sentimental or expected, but originality is high in conceptual execution and thematic layering.</comment>
