<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya is vividly rendered through layered traits—her rational impulsiveness, empathy, and haunted professionalism all support her intense embodiment method and bring emotional weight to her motivation; slightly more personal insight outside performance might deepen her beyond function and role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves clarity and coherence within its tight limit, using the performance arc to structure events; the twist revelation is earned yet efficient, though some transitions (especially the emotional pivot post-reveal) feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The post-oil Forbidden City as solar theater is richly imagined and organically layered with symbolism and sensory detail; the debris-filtered light and historical decay enrich both mood and metaphor without becoming mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegant prose, emotional undercurrents, and layered metaphor (sunlight as memory, performance as justice) give the story lasting resonance; despite brief length, there's thematic density and evocative weight, though some emotional beats could breathe more.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of speculative and literary ideas with striking metaphor and concept synergy; slightly familiar structural rhythms (ghost-channeling detective trope) mildly dull its originality, but execution is impressive and fresh in tone and texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Compelling, beautifully written, and conceptually cohesive; the elements feel deliberate, and the protagonist's gift/curse tension lingers powerfully—a rare example of layered storytelling without overflow or contrivance.</comment>
