<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kess is vividly drawn, her motivation to preserve music is both clear and emotionally compelling, expressed through action and symbolism. Slight lack of internal conflict or revealed history limits further depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from infiltration to payoff, with tight cause-effect progression. The ending feels earned and satisfying, but the initial setup is slightly rushed for maximum impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is lushly imaginative and integrally tied to theme and tone. Atmospheric details like invisible ink and windcrafting elevate the sensory immersion. Minor abstraction in factory mechanics weakens clarity slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism, with strong emotional and thematic resonance. The transformation of the factory into a cultural beacon is a powerful image. Could benefit from one more moment of tension or ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is poetic yet largely controlled—few lapses into over-ornamentation. Most imagery feels fresh, though one or two similes edge toward cliché. The originality of concept and lyricism is strong overall.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements cohere around theme and tone with rare clarity. The story carries lasting emotional and symbolic weight. A few narrative choices feel slightly safe, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
