<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story flows smoothly, with an organic introduction, development, and resolution; the emotional arc and underlying conflict (protection, purpose) are resolved with restraint and maturity, though initial stakes could be slightly more defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory detail anchors the setting; the longhouse and fjord are atmospheric and meaningful, seamlessly supporting tone and theme, though just shy of perfect due to slight over-reliance on familiar imagery.</comment>
