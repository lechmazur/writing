<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brother Cornelius is vividly rendered with clear psychological depth; his arc from rigid certainty to vulnerable insight is believable and emotionally resonant, though Margaret remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot has a strong internal logic, symbolic resonance, and satisfying transformation within tight word constraints; minor ambiguity around Lady Pemberton’s role slightly blurs narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original, with arresting metaphors and surreal imagery; avoids formulaic structure and reveals the author’s unique voice; one or two phrases flirt with overwriting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive and sophisticated piece blending theme, character, and setting; a few elements verge on opacity, but overall the story achieves outstanding literary quality.</comment>
