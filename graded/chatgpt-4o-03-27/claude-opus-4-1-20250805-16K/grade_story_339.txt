<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marina is a fully realized character with layered guilt, history, and purpose; her motivations are consistent and emotionally authentic, though some internal transitions could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-contained with a clear emotional climax and resolution, but a few pacing moments—especially the transition from memory to present action—feel slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—prismatic lake, oil rainbows, and the decaying amusement park form a vivid, symbolic backdrop that enhances the emotional tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the drawer knob, the lake, the seesaw) gives the story psychological depth and emotional resonance; ending is quietly devastating and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Writing is largely original and avoids cliché; metaphors are purposeful and fresh, though a few phrases edge toward poetic excess that could feel engineered rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion of elements with deliberate pacing and thematic clarity; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually despite its brevity.</comment>
