<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus is subtly but effectively drawn; his absent-mindedness and tactile connection to brewing ground his motivations. His shift from resignation to purpose is believable, though supporting characters are thinner.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc flows smoothly within the tight word count, from inciting moment to resolution. The plot hinges deftly on a small moment, though the train encounter strains plausibility slightly under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and viscerally rendered, from the humming servers to the aching silence of extinction. The archive is a resonant metaphor for memory and loss, reinforcing tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant with poetic turns of phrase and layered subtext. Symbolism (e.g., the knocker) enriches the narrative. The theme of preservation—of sound, craft, and meaning—emerges organically and powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and human nuance elevate the storytelling. The sensory language feels lived-in; emotional beats are earned. Only minor reliance on thematic tropes holds it back from full originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a poetic, thought-provoking tale. The story leaves a lasting trace of melancholy and renewal. Minor plausibility issues prevent a perfect score, but it's nearly publication-ready.</comment>
