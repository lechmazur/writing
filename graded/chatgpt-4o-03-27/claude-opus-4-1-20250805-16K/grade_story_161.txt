<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is sharply defined, with his obsessive punctuality and grief clearly informing his every action; his motivations are consistent, layered, and emotionally resonant, though minor characters like Dr. Havens remain more archetypal than fully developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is cohesive, builds tension effectively, and resolves with clarity, though the intricate conspiracy exposition slightly strains under the tight word count, verging on implausible in places.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The facility and orchard imagery are effective and symbolically rich, but sensory details are somewhat limited, and the atmosphere could be more deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storytelling is compelling with strong symbolism (e.g., the dove, the spiral), emotional depth, and a powerful arc; the ending resonates, though occasional exposition could be more subtly integrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking originality in the use of paper airplanes and peacock patterns, though some stylistic flourishes verge on melodrama and a few narrative connections feel slightly engineered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Overall, a taut, emotionally potent narrative with literary ambition; just shy of top-tier due to minor plausibility strains and a few underdeveloped atmospheric elements.</comment>
