<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marta is richly portrayed, her motivations are clear, deeply human, and aligned with her actions; her reverence and perseverance emerge naturally through the ritual, though lack of dialogue slightly limits dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is well contained with a strong arc—setup, rising tension, emotional climax, and resolution; the ritualistic pacing feels deliberate and earned, though the central twist requires some suspension of disbelief.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric—sensory details evoke the biting cold, the radiance of the aurora, and isolation; it elevates both action and concept into mythic territory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story succeeds at evoking wonder and grief, using metaphor and symbolism effectively; the aurora, the dough, and the saffron become powerful conduits of memory and resistance, though a minor tonal shift might broaden emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive premise and evocative imagery avoid cliché; while mystical, the narrative maintains internal logic and emotional depth—minor overreliance on lyrical phrasing risks veering into purple prose at moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the central idea cohesively; the story lingers emotionally, weaving history, ritual, ancestry, and resistance with a confident narrative voice.</comment>
