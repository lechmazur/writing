<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hermit's motivations are clearly aligned with her traits and actions—her rebellious interpretation of the comet, her mindful methodology, and her symbolic use of the flower album reflect a distinct and consistent character arc, though more internal conflict would deepen her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story presents a tight, cohesive arc with strong beginning, middle, and resolution; the comet’s arc mirrors the plot’s own transformation arc effectively. Cause and effect are symbolic yet coherent within the world’s metaphysics, with pacing well-controlled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The ghostly orchard under a burning comet is richly realized, evoking vivid sensory and thematic resonance. The atmosphere is immersive, poetic, and perfectly entwined with the protagonist’s purpose and the story’s tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotion, symbolism, and theme are masterfully interwoven. Metaphor and subtext drive the narrative. The ending offers both narrative closure and philosophical depth. A rare example of showing through imagery rather than telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original concept that subverts apocalyptic tropes with a meditative and unique approach. Metaphors are specific and fresh, though a few phrases verge on elevated abstraction that risk distancing the reader slightly from emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive and imaginative piece where all elements serve a unified thematic vision. Elegantly composed within the constraint, it leaves a lingering emotional and intellectual impression.</comment>
