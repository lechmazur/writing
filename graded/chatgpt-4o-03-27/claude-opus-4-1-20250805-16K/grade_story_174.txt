<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kira's regret-driven motivation is deeply compelling, and her emotional arc is clear and resonant. Her transformation through grief is believable, but her voice could be slightly more individuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-balanced, with a clear beginning, development, and resolution. The blending of emotional and magical logic makes the plot coherent despite its complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—the hidden library, the frost-mapped chemistry, and memory-laced fireworks all enhance tone and depth beautifully. Exceptional sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emotionally powerful with layered metaphor and image use. The ending transcends sentimentality through symbolic resonance. Minor reliance on exposition over dramatization slightly limits immersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Almost entirely free of cliché, with inventive use of concept. A few phrases border on over-elaborate, but the originality of emotional alchemy and firework-memory fusion is strong and fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Extremely cohesive and imaginative. The elements serve the story, not vice versa, and the emotional and conceptual depth lingers. Slight polish needed in prose precision for top-tier readiness.</comment>
