<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly sketched—a compelling blend of intellectual posturing and performative humility whose motivations are coherently deceptive yet oddly sincere; his voice is distinct and laced with irony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure is tight and complete, with a coherent arc from sewer to sermon and back; the pacing is elegant, though one or two transitions feel slightly orchestrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is strikingly immersive, juxtaposing rot and reverence; sensory details like moonlight on a punctured cup and branch-seats evoke a decayed beauty that enhances the tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The metaphors are mostly fresh, particularly the leaking cup; though some language edges toward crafted cleverness, the originality of the premise and its execution stand out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Artful, immersive, and thematically rich within constraints; strong interplay of tone, concept, and character drive lasting resonance.</comment>
