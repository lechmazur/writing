<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict is powerfully aligned with her role as a shy diviner—a reluctant agent of enormous consequence whose actions, though emotionally fraught, reflect consistency and purpose; her lack of dialogue robs us of a slightly fuller individual voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arc is compact and effective, transitioning fluidly from discovery to ritual to consequence; cause and effect are clearly traced, though a few timeline mechanics could be slightly more precise or layered without sacrificing brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is haunting and immersive, with vivid sensory details creating a convincingly drowned world; the setting is tightly woven into the plot’s emotional tone and function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional resonance and moral tension through restrained language and evocative imagery; the ritual's symbolism and concluding regret are impactful, though occasional abstraction distances the reader slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original concepts (timeline shopping, memory erosion via social media) feel fresh; a few phrases border on familiar, and emotional reactions could be more textured to deepen human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive, stylistically confident, and emotionally resonant; the story lingers with thoughtful weight and accomplishes much within its constrained form.</comment>
