<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Martha’s motivation is clear and compelling, and her "cynically gentle" demeanor is effectively shown through her quiet rebellion; she’s distinct and purposeful, though her internal conflict could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arc is impressively complete for the word count, with a satisfying beginning, middle, and end; the cause-effect logic holds well, but a few temporal elements edge toward the abstract, risking minor confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world is richly evocative, with shadows, lunar harvesting, and sensory detail all enhancing mood—though the time machine garage feels slightly underdeveloped in sensory or mechanical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is layered with metaphor and evokes emotional resonance through poetic imagery and implied trauma; Martha’s bread becomes a symbol of justice, though some moments flirt with overwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tone is distinctive and lyrical, with original metaphors and subversions of tropes; a few phrases verge on purple prose, but overall it feels purposefully constructed, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive and imaginative piece that blends mysticism, vengeance, and empathy; minor abstraction in the science-fantasy elements keeps it just shy of perfection, but it lingers effectively.</comment>
