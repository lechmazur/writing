<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Katarina is vividly drawn with a compelling mix of maternal desperation and methodical precision; her unique methods reflect her personality and trauma, though her arc's emotional climax borders on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and well-contained, progressing cleanly through setup, tension, climax, and resolution while tying directly back to the initial image; minor compression at the end slightly hinders full emotional development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and emotionally resonant; the piece feels like a complete whole rather than a stitched-together prompt match, with strong creative synthesis of disparate elements.</comment>
