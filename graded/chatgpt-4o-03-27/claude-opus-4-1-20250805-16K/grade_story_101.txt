<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot is thematically coherent but structurally diffuse; it leans heavily on mood and metaphor, with minimal tangible progression or resolution, which undermines narrative satisfaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Conceptual boldness and language elevate the piece, though abstraction limits accessibility; cohesion is impressive, and the story provokes reflection beyond its length.</comment>
