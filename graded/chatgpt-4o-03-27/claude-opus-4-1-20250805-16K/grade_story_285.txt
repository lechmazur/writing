<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's awkwardness and hesitation are effectively woven into both physical and metaphysical struggles, with motivation evolving organically; however, deeper psychological nuance or more vivid internal voice would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is clear and thematically cohesive, with strong cause-effect logic; the ending resolves the character's arc and the stakes meaningfully, though the shift from internal conflict to ritual resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail and symbolic resonance, enhancing the tone and theme; the geothermal-steam-ice contrast deepens the narrative’s liminality without overwhelming it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors are layered and potent, especially the hermit crab imagery and veils between worlds; the emotional arc is compelling but lacks dialogue or interaction to further ground the experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and exhibits a distinct stylistic voice; however, phrases like “ephemeral yet sharp” and some mystical flourishes teeter on the edge of purple prose, threatening clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A strong, cohesive story where all major components serve theme and tone effectively; the result is emotionally evocative, though some ambiguity in mystical mechanics slightly muddles clarity.</comment>
