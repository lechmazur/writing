<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlene is richly drawn—her grief, ritualistic devotion, and darkly absurd hope are consistent and compelling throughout; her voice is distinct, and her motivations are emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story forms a complete arc within its constraint, effectively structured around the ritual and postcards; minor ambiguity in narrative causality slightly diminishes coherence but suits the magical realism tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is haunting and evocative, with the fog, forgotten orchard, and warm forge deeply enhancing tone and theme; sensory detail is precise and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotionally rich and thematically layered, with confident use of metaphor, symbolism, and poetic language; the surreal yet grounded ending lingers powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is highly original with fresh metaphors (“teaching a fish to waltz”), and the concept evolves unpredictably; language is elegant but purposeful, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and tonal balance; elements feel chosen to enrich character and theme rather than fulfill prompts—story resonates beyond its word limit.</comment>
