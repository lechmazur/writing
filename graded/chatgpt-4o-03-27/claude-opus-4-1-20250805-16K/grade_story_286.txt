<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as a "wildly reserved" apologizer is effectively conveyed through her ritualistic actions, restrained emotional palette, and reflective tone; her motivations are consistent, though further interpersonal detail or backstory could deepen emotional connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a strong internal arc and thematic resolution, with the broken record serving as a symbolic catalyst; however, the climax is more atmospheric than active, which mutes narrative momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The nanobotanical garden is rendered with luminous texture and layered sensory cues, deeply intertwined with the narrative's emotional and symbolic architecture; the world feels both alien and intimate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Beautifully cohesive with a striking thematic core; it balances worldbuilding, character, and poetic craft, though a slightly deeper emotional payoff could increase its lasting resonance.</comment>
