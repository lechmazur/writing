<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchardist and the child are both distinct and emotionally resonant; their motivations—connection and curiosity—are clearly conveyed through action and dialogue, though the child’s development is slightly less nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the discovery of the key and descent into the underlayers are well-paced and logically connected, though the climax resolves a bit too smoothly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cyberpunk rooftop garden and decaying underlayers are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the setting enhances the themes of disconnection and regrowth beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotionally evocative and thematically rich, with strong use of metaphor and symbolism; the ending is hopeful without being saccharine, though the central conflict could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story above cliché; some phrasing borders on overly poetic, but overall the voice feels authentic and human rather than formulaic.</comment>
