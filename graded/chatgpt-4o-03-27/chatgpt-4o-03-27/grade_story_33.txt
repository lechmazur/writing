<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The birdwatcher is vividly rendered with a distinct internal contradiction and symbolic motivation; his actions align with his philosophy, though his emotional arc could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the climax is more symbolic than dramatic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (scent of chlorophyll, marble reflections) enhancing tone and theme; the surreal elements blend well with the grounded setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the story lingers with its thematic depth and stylistic confidence, though not quite flawless in execution.</comment>
