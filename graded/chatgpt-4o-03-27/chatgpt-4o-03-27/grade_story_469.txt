<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian is vividly drawn with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in personal loss; his emotional restraint and methodical nature align well with his "logically emotional" trait, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the countdown adds urgency, and the cause-effect chain is logical, though the climax resolves a bit too smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While some phrasing leans toward the ornate, the story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in concept and execution; emotional nuance is shown rather than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements serve the narrative organically, and the story lingers with emotional and thematic weight; the brevity feels intentional, not limiting.</comment>
