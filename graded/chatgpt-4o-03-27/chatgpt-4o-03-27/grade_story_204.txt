<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict and transformation are well-rendered, with her prejudice and emotional evolution driving the story; however, her profession as a cuddler feels underutilized in shaping her personality or actions beyond the final gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotional resolution; the cause-effect chain is coherent, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details and metaphors that evoke a haunting, liminal space; the hangar and its decay mirror the protagonist’s internal shift effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, using metaphor and subtext to explore connection and prejudice; the ending is poignant and earned, though slightly abstract in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in concept and tone, some phrasing veers toward poetic excess, and the “phantom punch” risks feeling symbolic rather than grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally impactful, and thematically rich, with strong integration of elements and a lingering sense of transformation; minor underuse of some assigned elements prevents a perfect score.</comment>
