<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian is richly developed, with his guilt, obsession, and fractured identity driving consistent, emotionally resonant actions; his motivations are clear and deeply tied to his past and the symbolic photo album.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and cathartic end; the plunge of the album and the rain are well-seeded, though pacing slightly lingers in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply atmospheric, with strong sensory and symbolic resonance; the petrified oak and desert evoke a haunting post-human world that enhances the story’s tone and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotionally powerful and thematically rich, the story uses metaphor and symbolism effectively; the rain as catharsis is earned, and the writing style is lyrical without excess, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
