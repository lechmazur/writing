<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax is a well-drawn character with clear emotional depth and motivation; his internal conflict and gestures (trembling hands, the gauntlet, the map) reveal a layered personality, though his brother remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional climax; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the brother’s arrival feels a touch too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is richly rendered with sensory detail—steam, brass, citrus smoke—creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere that mirrors the emotional tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (coral, rust, gears) and subtext elevates the emotional resonance; the story shows rather than tells, and the ending is quietly powerful and thematically cohesive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh and specific, with minimal cliché; emotional nuance is handled with restraint, though a few phrases verge on poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically confident; it feels complete and lingers in the mind, though not quite flawless in originality or pacing.</comment>
