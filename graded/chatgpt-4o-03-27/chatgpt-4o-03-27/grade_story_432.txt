<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian is vividly drawn with a unique profession and existential motivation; his death wish and obsession with truth are consistent and compelling, though his emotional depth could be slightly more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, climax, and resolution; the collapse of the sculpture as a signal is effective, though the pacing near the end feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The subterranean setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details like icy mist and roaring water enhancing the mood; the world of the Undermind feels immersive and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism (spiral, poison, convergence), and a haunting resolution elevate the story; the emotional impact is strong, though the psychic-radio method is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite minor underutilization of one element, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically confident; it lingers in the mind with its surreal, mythic tone.</comment>
