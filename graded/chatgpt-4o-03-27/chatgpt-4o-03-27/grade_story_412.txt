<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian is a compelling, well-drawn character whose internal contradictions—bookish assassin, geographically challenged yet navigating by frequency—are consistently and meaningfully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the progression from static analysis to revelation is logical, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the wind-scoured ridge and static-laced dreams create a haunting, immersive world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., rubber key cover, static, fog); emotional resonance is high, though the theme could be more subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story; some phrasing edges toward the overly poetic, but overall it avoids cliché and formula.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and purpose; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though a touch more ambiguity might deepen its impact.</comment>
