<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vey is vividly rendered with a unique internal conflict and evolution; their transformation from flickering shapeshifter to fixed fulcrum is emotionally and thematically resonant, though some motivations remain abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and transformative climax; pacing is strong, though the final pivot to cosmic consequence feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined with immersive sensory detail—rain slicing through forms, caves singing, suspended droplets—creating a vivid, surreal atmosphere that enhances the narrative’s mythic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking use of symbolism and metaphor (figurine, sigil, rain), layered themes of identity and destiny, and a haunting final image; the story lingers, though some emotional beats could be deepened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of mythic and sci-fi elements with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; avoids cliché and formula, though a few transitions verge on poetic abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; the elements feel integral rather than imposed, and the story leaves a lasting impression of transformation and cosmic tension.</comment>
