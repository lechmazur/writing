<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin’s motivations are deeply felt and consistent, with his actions—setting up a forge, creating the phoenix—clearly aligned with his internal drive and grief; however, the daughter’s character is underdeveloped, limiting emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant end; pacing is strong, though the daughter's arrival feels slightly abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
