<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Corwin is richly drawn, with a clear internal motivation and a consistent emotional arc; his obsession and charm are well-balanced, though his transformation could use slightly more tension or resistance to deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically unified, with a satisfying arc; however, the pacing is slightly languid in places, and the climax, while poetic, lacks a sharper narrative pivot or external conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and lyrical, with vivid sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the firefly grounds and their transformation into a cathedral of memory are especially evocative and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and stylistically elegant, with layered symbolism and a strong thematic core; however, the lack of dialogue or interpersonal tension slightly limits dramatic dynamism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically resonant, and stylistically confident; it lingers in the mind and feels complete despite its brevity, though a touch more narrative friction would elevate it further.</comment>
