<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eliot’s internal conflict is well-rendered and consistent, with his poetic repression and fear of insignificance driving his actions; however, his transformation feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the “ambush” of vision is effective, though the pacing around the mural’s reveal could be more gradual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the overgrown city street enhances the theme of reclamation and forgotten beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically layered, with strong use of metaphor and symbolism; the mural and perfume bottle serve as powerful narrative devices, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in tone and concept, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; a few phrases verge on purple prose, but overall the story avoids formulaic patterns and cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally impactful, with all elements serving the central theme; the story lingers in the mind, though a slightly subtler ending might elevate it further.</comment>
