<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla is vividly drawn with a unique profession and a compelling emotional arc; her motivations evolve naturally from guilt to purpose, though her "intellectually spontaneous" trait could be more distinctly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc with a satisfying resolution; the comb’s fall and discovery of the glyph are well-seeded and pay off effectively, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stone circle is atmospheric and symbolically rich, with sensory and metaphorical detail enhancing mood and theme; the setting feels integral to the story’s emotional and narrative weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (flowers, watcher, comb); the story evokes reflection and emotional resonance, though some transitions verge on overly poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice elevate the narrative; minor moments of overwritten prose and slightly mechanical phrasing prevent a perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a layered, emotionally satisfying story with thematic depth and stylistic confidence; a few moments feel slightly ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
