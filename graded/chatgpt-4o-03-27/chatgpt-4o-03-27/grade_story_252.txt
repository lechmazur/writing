<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s arc from thief to penitent keeper is emotionally resonant and consistent, with his motivations clearly tied to past guilt and a desire for restoration; however, his internal voice could be more distinct to elevate character depth further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc—beginning in guilt, climaxing at the fracture, and resolving in redemption—though the pacing slightly compresses the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail and metaphor, enhancing the surreal tone and supporting the emotional and thematic weight of memory and preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Powerful use of symbolism and subtext, especially the toy block and petals; the story evokes deep emotion and reflection, though a touch more ambiguity could enhance its literary resonance.</comment>
