<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the symbolic release of the letter and artifacts provides closure, though the pacing occasionally leans toward the meditative at the expense of narrative tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, using metaphor and symbolism effectively; the ending is poignant and satisfying, though the lack of dialogue slightly limits dynamic tension.</comment>
