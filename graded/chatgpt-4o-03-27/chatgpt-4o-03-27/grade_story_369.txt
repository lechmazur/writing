<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emory is vividly drawn with consistent traits—his obsession, guilt, and introspection are well-aligned with his actions and reactions; however, his motivation for spiritual development remains abstract and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotional resolution; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the stakes remain internal rather than escalating.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric and deeply integrated into the story’s tone and themes, with sensory details and metaphors enhancing the mood and reinforcing the character’s isolation and introspection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, spiral, string), layered subtext, and emotional resonance; the story effectively shows rather than tells, though the ending could land with slightly more narrative tension or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in tone and metaphor, with fresh imagery and a distinctive voice; a few phrases verge on the ornate, and the emotional nuance occasionally leans toward the explicit rather than implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thematically rich, with creative integration of elements and a lingering emotional impact; minor abstraction in motivation and resolution keeps it just shy of perfection.</comment>
