<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character has a compelling symbolic role, but her personality and motivation remain abstract and underdeveloped; her "awkwardness" and "individually general" traits are not meaningfully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative and thematically ambitious, but the story leans heavily on abstraction and symbolism at the expense of emotional depth and narrative clarity.</comment>
