<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s motivations are present but underdeveloped; her emotional arc lacks specificity and her reactions to key events feel abstract rather than grounded in character psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot has a discernible arc, but transitions are vague and the resolution feels more thematic than narratively earned; cause-effect logic is often implied rather than shown.</comment>
