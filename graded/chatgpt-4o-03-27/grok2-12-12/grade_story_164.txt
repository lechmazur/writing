<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's wistfulness and subtlety are well-integrated into her motivations and actions, though her "drifting arrogance" is underdeveloped and lacks clear manifestation in behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and thematic unity, but lacks a strong narrative progression or conflict; it leans heavily on mood over plot movement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade is vividly rendered and contrasts effectively with Elaraâ€™s naturalistic focus; sensory details and atmosphere are immersive and thematically resonant.</comment>
