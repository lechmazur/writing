<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dreamer pilot has a distinct tone and internal logic, but her motivations—mourning and cognitive mapping—are more told than shown, and her emotional arc lacks depth and specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story has a beginning, middle, and end, but transitions (especially the shift to the language exchange) feel abrupt and underdeveloped, weakening narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting is imaginative and atmospheric, with the rustic kitchen and spice rack offering strong sensory anchors, though the interdimensional portal remains abstract and underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>There is thematic ambition and symbolic layering (e.g., spice rack as guide), but emotional resonance is muted and the prose occasionally veers into vague abstraction rather than concrete storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows some originality, but the language is sometimes overly formal or generic, and the emotional beats feel more conceptual than lived-in.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and conceptually rich, but lacks the emotional immediacy and stylistic precision required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
