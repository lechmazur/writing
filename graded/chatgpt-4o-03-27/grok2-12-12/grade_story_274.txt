<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Verdant's transformation from passive to purposeful is compelling, but its emotional arc lacks nuance and the "apathetically devoted" trait is underexplored beyond the initial premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, though the pacing is slightly uneven and the transition from house to drive-in feels abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Inventive and thematically cohesive, but the prose occasionally leans into abstraction at the expense of clarity and emotional immediacy.</comment>
