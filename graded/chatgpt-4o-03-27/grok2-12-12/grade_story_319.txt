<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elion’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal conflict ("resolutely wavering") is underdeveloped and lacks nuance; his voice is subdued and not particularly distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the escape feels too convenient; cause-effect logic is mostly sound but not deeply explored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but lacks the depth, stylistic precision, and narrative risk-taking expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
