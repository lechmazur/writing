<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elise's personality is lightly sketched but lacks depth; her forgetfulness is mentioned but rarely shown in action, and her motivation, while stated, feels more symbolic than emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions—especially the leap from foraging to negotiating with officials—feel abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in premise, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes (eccentric artist meets scientist) and lacks the stylistic nuance or surprise that would elevate it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and pleasant, but it doesn’t linger or provoke; it feels more like a well-structured sketch than a fully realized literary piece.</comment>
