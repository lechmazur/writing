<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thane’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond surface traits; his “brash” and “consciously wild” nature is told more than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the method of detonation via nautilus patterns strains plausibility and coherence, weakening narrative logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and earnest, but the integration of elements feels mechanical at times; it shows creative intent but lacks polish and emotional resonance for top-tier publication.</comment>
