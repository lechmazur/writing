<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a beginning, middle, and end, but the pacing feels uneven and the resolution too abrupt; the action of gloating is well integrated but the arc lacks tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and integrates most elements, but it feels constructed around prompts rather than organically developed; emotional impact is moderate.</comment>
