<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed and some transitions (e.g., postcard activation) are too convenient or underexplained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but its emotional and thematic resonance is muted by surface-level character work and occasional narrative shortcuts.</comment>
