<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Whisperer’s motivations are clear and consistent, but his internal development remains static; his spinelessness is told more than shown, and his emotional arc lacks depth or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a clear resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and the climax lacks narrative tension; the action of influence is present but not dynamically executed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail; the atmosphere supports the tone and theme well, though some elements feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the owl), and the theme of futility is clear, but emotional resonance is muted and the prose occasionally veers into abstraction without payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are evocative, but others feel generic or overwritten; the story avoids clichés but lacks a distinctive voice or surprising insight that would elevate it above the familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but it doesn’t fully capitalize on its imaginative premise; the execution is competent but not exceptional or deeply affecting.</comment>
