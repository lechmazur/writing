<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in the setting and emotional premise, but the narrative leans on familiar tropes (lost love, rebels, secret meeting) without significant subversion or surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, but lacks the stylistic precision, thematic depth, and originality required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
