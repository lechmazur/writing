<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels too abrupt and underdeveloped; his “sullen” nature is told rather than shown, and his emotional arc lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—key transitions (e.g., inspiration from stamps to life change) feel rushed and overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The underwater power station is evocative in concept but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the setting feels more like a backdrop than an active force in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>There’s thematic ambition and symbolic layering (stamps, quilt), but the prose leans toward exposition over immersion, and emotional beats are often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some metaphors (quilt, stamps) are promising but feel slightly generic; emotional shifts are stated plainly, and the writing lacks the nuance or surprise of truly original work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and earnest, but its execution is too safe and surface-level to meet the standards of top-tier literary fiction; it lacks the stylistic precision and emotional complexity required.</comment>
