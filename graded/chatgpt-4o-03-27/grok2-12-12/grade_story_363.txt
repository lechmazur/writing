<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The miner's grief and motivation are clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond his mourning and mission; his voice is subdued and indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and logical flow, but the action of coaxing insights feels abstract and underdeveloped in terms of narrative tension or progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is moody and evocative, but the setting lacks specificity and sensory richness; the parade and hall feel more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (the bell), but lacks a strong central conflict or memorable twist; the ending is quiet but not striking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in tone and concept, but the prose occasionally leans into generic phrasing and lacks the vivid specificity or surprise of top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, but not yet exceptional; it feels more like a promising draft than a fully realized literary piece.</comment>
