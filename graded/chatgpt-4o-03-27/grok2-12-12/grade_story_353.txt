<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her personality—especially the “cynically gentle” trait—is underdeveloped and mostly told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the time travel mechanics and the connection between moon patterns and the tyrant’s rise feel underexplored and overly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but lacks the depth, nuance, and stylistic precision required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
