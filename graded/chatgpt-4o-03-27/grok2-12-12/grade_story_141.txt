<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his transformation feels too abrupt and underdeveloped; Mara is more archetype than character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a beginning, middle, and end, but the scavenger hunt element is jarringly out of place and disrupts narrative coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>There’s a cohesive arc and some thematic ambition, but the story feels constructed around prompts rather than emerging naturally.</comment>
