<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his personality is distinct, but emotional depth and complexity are underdeveloped, limiting resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but transitions between elements (e.g., nightmares, coded letter) feel abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is imaginative and atmospheric, but sensory detail is sparse and the ossuary-restaurant fusion lacks grounding or vivid texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>There’s thematic ambition and metaphorical layering, but emotional impact is muted and subtext is hinted at rather than fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but several elements feel algorithmically combined rather than organically integrated; prose occasionally veers toward generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Creative premise with a cohesive arc, but the story feels more like a clever exercise than a fully immersive literary experience.</comment>
