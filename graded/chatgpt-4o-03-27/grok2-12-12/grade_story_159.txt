<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thales is distinct and consistent, with his earnest frivolity and philosophical drive well-integrated, but Eirene’s betrayal lacks sufficient foreshadowing or emotional depth to fully land.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the confetti-coded method feels underdeveloped and the betrayal, while pivotal, is abrupt and insufficiently built up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sandstone labyrinth and floating lanterns create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the story’s tone and metaphorical depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly the kaleidoscope and labyrinth, but emotional beats could be more deeply rendered for greater impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise and imagery, but some elements (e.g., confetti-coded proposals) feel whimsical without sufficient grounding, and emotional nuance is occasionally surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Inventive and thematically rich, but cohesion suffers slightly from underexplained mechanics and a betrayal that feels more functional than transformative.</comment>
