<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and his motivations are clearly tied to his actions, but his "unhinged zealotry" is more told than shown, and his voice lacks the depth or unpredictability such a character might demand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot feels more like a mood piece than a narrative driven by cause and effect; the action of "uprooting" is internal and subtle, which may undercut narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with creative integration of elements, but it leans heavily on atmosphere over narrative drive, limiting its broader impact.</comment>
