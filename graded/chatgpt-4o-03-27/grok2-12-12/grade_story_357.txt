<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clearly tied to her internal struggle with despair, and her actions—especially her decision to attend the party—align with her character arc. However, her "seldom odd" trait is underdeveloped, and her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with the party serving as a catalyst for internal change. The board game rounds provide structure, though the pacing occasionally feels static, and the climax is understated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The frost giant’s lair is evocative and metaphorically rich, but sensory detail is sparse. The setting supports the theme of isolation, yet the atmosphere could be more immersive and textured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The black rose is a strong symbol, and the story explores solitude with subtlety. However, emotional depth is more told than shown, and the prose, while competent, lacks stylistic distinction or memorable imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows some originality in concept, but the execution leans on familiar emotional beats. Some transitions feel formulaic, and the tone occasionally slips into generic introspection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a satisfying emotional arc. However, it lacks the stylistic daring or narrative risk-taking expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
