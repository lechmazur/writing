<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clearly tied to her whimsical yet serious nature, and her evolution from environmental chronicler to mortality-confronting artist is compelling, though her emotional arc could be more deeply rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and thematic resolution, but transitions—especially the shift to fortune-tellers—feel abrupt and underdeveloped, slightly weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inventive and thematically rich, with a cohesive tone and structure, though some elements feel more decorative than essential, slightly diluting overall impact.</comment>
