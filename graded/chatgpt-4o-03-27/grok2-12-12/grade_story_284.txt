<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Captain Sincerity has a defined motivation and a consistent demeanor, but his internal transformation feels more told than shown, and his stoicism lacks nuance or evolution beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the connection between the paper plane and the emotional climax feels tenuous; the wallet-return subplot overshadows the initial mystery without resolving it meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The beekeeper's sanctuary is evocative and sensory-rich, but the setting feels underutilized in shaping the emotional stakes or deepening the character's journey beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story gestures toward emotional depth and metaphor, but the prose leans on abstractions and lacks the specificity or tension needed to fully engage or resonate; the ending is neat but not earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clich√©s, it leans on familiar tropes (mysterious note, soulful stranger) without subverting them; some phrasing feels overly polished or generic, lacking a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but its emotional arc feels schematic; the elements are competently integrated but rarely surprising or deeply affecting.</comment>
