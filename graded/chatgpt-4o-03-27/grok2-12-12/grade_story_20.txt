<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archer's emotional arc is present but underdeveloped; his motivations are stated rather than deeply explored, and his transformation feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes (e.g., from waterfall to attraction) feel abrupt and slightly contrived, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial timeframe create a surreal, evocative atmosphere, though sensory detail is sparse and the setting feels more metaphorical than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, but emotional impact is dulled by telling over showing; the story gestures at depth without fully realizing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in imagery and concept, but the prose occasionally lapses into generic phrasing and lacks the stylistic distinctiveness of top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the polish, nuance, and emotional resonance required for elite publication.</comment>
