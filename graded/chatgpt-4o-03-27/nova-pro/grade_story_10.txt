<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The character's arc is emotionally resonant and thematically aligned, but his identity as a "cheerless duelist" is underdeveloped—his dueling past is never explored or connected to his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—some transitions feel abrupt, and the plot leans heavily on metaphor without grounding action in concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and evocative, with strong sensory cues like the rattling chest and humming servers, though the spaceport context could be more fully integrated into the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (maggots, mutated recipes) adds emotional depth, but the story occasionally tells rather than shows, and lacks a truly memorable or surprising moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and metaphor, but the language occasionally veers into generic abstraction, and the emotional beats feel slightly formulaic in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with a satisfying arc, but lacks the polish and narrative precision expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
