<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—some transitions feel abrupt, and the plot relies heavily on symbolic moments rather than concrete developments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, especially with the mirror and label, but the central conflict lacks urgency and the ending, while satisfying, feels slightly sentimental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on cliché; the writing avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on generic emotional shorthand rather than nuanced expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, with creative use of elements, but lacks the sharp originality or emotional depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
