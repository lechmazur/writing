<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story has a beginning, middle, and end, but the plot progression is more atmospheric than driven by clear cause and effect; the resolution feels symbolic rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Several phrases feel formulaic or overly ornate; the prose lacks the freshness and specificity needed to elevate it beyond genre tropes or AI-like constructions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive in tone but not in narrative depth; the elements are present but feel more assembled than organically integrated, limiting emotional and thematic impact.</comment>
