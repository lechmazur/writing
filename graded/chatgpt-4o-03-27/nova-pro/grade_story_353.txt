<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's personality is hinted at but underdeveloped; her motivations shift from curiosity to heroism without sufficient internal conflict or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions—especially from bakery to time travel—feel abrupt and underexplained, weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive and complete, but lacks the depth, originality, and stylistic precision expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
