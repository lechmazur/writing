<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The knight’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond the archetype; his cleverly naive trait is told rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the method of syncing with frequencies feels abstract and underexplained, weakening the logic of the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but its execution feels more like a well-structured concept than a fully realized literary piece with lasting resonance.</comment>
