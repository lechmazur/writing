<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, and his ghost-seeing ability ties into his internal conflict, but his “elegantly clumsy” trait is underdeveloped and has little narrative impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying emotional arc and thematic resolution, but the plot progression is more reflective than active, with minimal external conflict or stakes to drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sand castle preservation lab is a rich, symbolic setting that mirrors Leo’s emotional state, and the atmosphere is consistently meditative and melancholic, though sensory detail is sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally evocative and thematically layered, with strong symbolism (e.g., the flower crown), but it leans heavily on telling rather than showing, and lacks narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and has a unique premise, but some phrasing feels overly abstract or generic, and the prose occasionally lapses into vague sentimentality rather than grounded specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a clear emotional journey, but it lacks the narrative dynamism and stylistic precision expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
