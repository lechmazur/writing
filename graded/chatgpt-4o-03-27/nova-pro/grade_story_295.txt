<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s jovial nature and reluctant courage are introduced, but his internal conflict lacks depth and evolution; his motivation is stated rather than shown through meaningful choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions feel mechanical and the pacing is overly linear, with little tension or surprise to sustain momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competently structured and thematically coherent, but the story feels more like a well-executed prompt response than a fully realized literary piece.</comment>
