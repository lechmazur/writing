<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh and the tone is consistent, but moments of vague phrasing and slightly generic emotional beats suggest a lack of distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a gentle emotional resonance, but lacks the narrative tension or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
