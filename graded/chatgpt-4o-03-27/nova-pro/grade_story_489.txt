<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The observer’s motivation is clear, but their personality remains vague and underdeveloped; “aggressively kind” is not meaningfully explored or demonstrated through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The plot has a symbolic arc and a sense of resolution, but the cause-effect chain is tenuous and abstract, with the whistle’s impact on the dancer feeling metaphorical rather than narratively grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse and oceanic atmosphere are evocative and consistent, though sensory detail is sparse and the setting could be more dynamically integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story leans heavily on symbolism and poetic tone, but lacks emotional depth and specificity; the central conflict is abstract, and the resolution feels more conceptual than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows some originality, the language is often vague or overly lyrical, and the emotional resonance is muted by a lack of concrete detail or human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but its impact is dulled by abstraction and a lack of narrative tension; it feels more like a prose poem than a fully realized short story.</comment>
