<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archer’s emotional arc is present but underdeveloped; his transformation feels abrupt, and his motivation to chronicle social movements emerges too late and without grounding in earlier behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from personal regret to social activism is jarring and lacks narrative buildup; the bridge metaphor is strong but overused.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial imagery create a vivid, surreal atmosphere, though some elements feel ornamental rather than integral to the plot or character development.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>There is emotional resonance and symbolic layering, but the prose occasionally veers into cliché and abstraction, weakening the impact of otherwise strong imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others feel generic or AI-like; the tone shifts awkwardly, and the final twist into activism lacks authenticity and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but its thematic ambition outpaces its execution; the ending feels more conceptual than earned through character or plot.</comment>
