<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is intriguing and consistent, but her personality traits—particularly "meticulously impulsive"—are underdeveloped and not convincingly demonstrated through her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the central action (prediction) is abstract and lacks tangible stakes or consequences, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with a memorable theme, but lacks the narrative urgency or stylistic precision expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
