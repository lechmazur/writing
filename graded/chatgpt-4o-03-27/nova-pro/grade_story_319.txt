<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to escape her fate is clear and emotionally resonant, but her transformation from frail guard to empowered figure feels abrupt and underdeveloped given the limited internal conflict or resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven—Elara’s decision and the climax arrive too quickly, with little buildup or complication to deepen the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels slightly generic or overly poetic without precision; while not formulaic, the story leans on familiar tropes and lacks a distinctive stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally satisfying, but doesn’t fully transcend its premise or offer the depth and originality expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
