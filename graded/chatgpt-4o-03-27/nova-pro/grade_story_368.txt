<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and progression, but the pacing is uneven and some transitions feel abrupt or overly reliant on poetic abstraction rather than cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard temple is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, and the atmosphere supports the mystical tone, though some imagery verges on overwrought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the setting and object are intriguing, the prose occasionally lapses into generic phrasing and familiar tropes, with some signs of formulaic construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but lacks the polish, depth, and originality required for top-tier publication; it gestures at profundity without fully achieving it.</comment>
