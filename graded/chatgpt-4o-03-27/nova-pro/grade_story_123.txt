<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clearly stated and consistent, but her personality—especially the “gleefully morose” trait—feels underexplored and not meaningfully reflected in her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is overly even, lacking tension or escalation; the action of sweeping is symbolic but not plot-driving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the facility and its decay are evocative, though the timeframe “between empire transitions” is vague and underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and has some fresh imagery, it occasionally lapses into generic phrasing and overly ornate language that dulls its originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtfully constructed, but it plays it safe—missing the complexity, tension, or stylistic daring expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
