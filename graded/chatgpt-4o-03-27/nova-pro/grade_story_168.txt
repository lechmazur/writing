<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and her use of the comb is symbolically resonant, but her "ruthlessness" as a flower arranger is not meaningfully explored or reflected in her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the method of discovery (comb + road trip conversations) strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forest and stone circle are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail, and the atmosphere supports the mystery and introspection well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>There’s emotional resonance and thematic depth, but the prose occasionally veers into overwrought abstraction, and the central conflict lacks urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others feel generic or ornamental; the tone is mostly consistent, though the "spontaneous road trip" detail feels tacked on and artificial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, but not yet at a level of polish or originality required for top-tier publication; some elements feel more assigned than organic.</comment>
