<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elionâ€™s motivation to preserve craft and his emotional burden are clear, but his personality lacks depth beyond poetic melancholy; his voice is atmospheric but not distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is overly languid and the cause-effect chain between the bell and emotional resolution feels symbolic rather than narratively earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and emotional nuance, but the prose occasionally veers into purple territory and leans on familiar tropes without subversion; originality is present but not striking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, but lacks the narrative tension or stylistic precision required for top-tier publication; it lingers emotionally but not memorably.</comment>
