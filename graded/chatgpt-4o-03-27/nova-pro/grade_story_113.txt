<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bard’s internal journey is clear, but his personality and motivation remain abstract; “shyly loud” is poetic but underexplored in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and emotional resolution, but transitions between dream and reality are overly smooth, reducing tension and stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically resonant, but lacks the narrative sharpness or surprise needed for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
