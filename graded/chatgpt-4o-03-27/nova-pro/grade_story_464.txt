<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila has a distinct personality and motivation, but her role as a "sassy cook" is underdeveloped and disconnected from her actions; her academic mischief is mentioned but not meaningfully explored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but the character’s role and some elements feel loosely integrated, and the prose lacks the polish and precision expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
