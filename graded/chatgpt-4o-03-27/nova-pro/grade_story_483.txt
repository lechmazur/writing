<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tom’s weariness and desire for freedom are clear, but his emotional arc lacks depth and specificity; his transformation feels too sudden and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—Tom’s shift from despair to peace happens too quickly, and the plot relies heavily on symbolic rather than causal progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The contrast between the chaotic road life and the serene garden/meditation room is effective, but sensory detail is sparse and the lava lamp room feels more quirky than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Ace of Hearts is a strong symbol, and the story hints at deeper themes, but the emotional impact is muted by a lack of vivid scenes and subtext; much is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and has a gentle tone, it leans on familiar tropes (weary lawman, symbolic object, sudden peace) without subverting them or offering fresh insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the complexity, tension, and stylistic precision expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
