<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict is well-drawn and her motivations are emotionally resonant, but her “timidly bold” trait is more told than shown, and her arc, while poignant, lacks sharper turns or surprises.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and the climax—her decision to reclaim joy—feels more reflective than active, softening narrative momentum.</comment>
