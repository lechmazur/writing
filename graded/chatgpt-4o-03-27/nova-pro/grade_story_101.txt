<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mr. Thompson is warmly sketched but lacks depth; his motivations are implied rather than explored, and tenants remain faceless, limiting emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and thematic cohesion, but the parade detour feels more symbolic than causally integrated, weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
