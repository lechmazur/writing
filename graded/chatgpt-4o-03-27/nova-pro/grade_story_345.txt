<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Father Thomas has a clear backstory and internal conflict, but his motivations and emotional arc remain surface-level and underdeveloped, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but the resolution feels more symbolic than narratively earned, and pacing is slightly repetitive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The surreal orchard and snow-laced atmosphere are vividly rendered and immersive, though some imagery verges on overwrought and lacks grounding detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and mood, but emotional impact is dulled by abstract phrasing and lack of concrete stakes or tension; the ending is evocative but not fully satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others feel generic or AI-like; emotional nuance is often told rather than shown, and the prose occasionally lapses into purple territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the narrative sharpness and emotional resonance required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
