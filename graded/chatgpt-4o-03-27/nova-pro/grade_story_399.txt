<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thaddeus is distinct and consistent, with a clear arc from gruff isolation to introspective healing, though his transformation feels slightly rushed and underexplored emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—some transitions (e.g., from skepticism to deep introspection) feel abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and tone; the forest, crypt, and scrying room all enhance the mystical, introspective mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story evokes reflection and uses symbolism effectively, but lacks a truly memorable or surprising moment to elevate it beyond competent craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels slightly generic or overly poetic; while the story avoids clichés, it doesn’t fully subvert expectations or offer a strikingly original voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with a satisfying emotional arc, but it doesn’t quite reach the level of literary distinction expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
