<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber is a compelling, well-motivated character whose deceptive nature and quiet resolve are consistently portrayed through action and subtle cues; however, the young historian is underdeveloped by comparison.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a satisfying arc and resolution, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax and resolution into too brief a space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique protagonist; avoids clichés and demonstrates a distinct narrative voice with layered meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and imaginative, with all elements serving the story’s theme; the brevity feels intentional, though a touch more development in the climax would elevate it further.</comment>
