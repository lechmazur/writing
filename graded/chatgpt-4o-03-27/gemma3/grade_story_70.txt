<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the pacing is strong, though the adhesive analysis feels slightly under-integrated into the plot’s momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply atmospheric, with sensory details (ozone, damp stone, ethereal glow) enhancing tone and theme; the greenhouse and gravestones metaphorically support the story’s emotional undercurrent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elegant prose, layered symbolism, and emotional payoff elevate the story; the light bulb as a vessel of grief is a powerful metaphor, and the final realization is both subtle and moving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise avoid cliché; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, though a few phrases verge on ornate; overall, the voice feels distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements serve the narrative organically, and the story lingers emotionally; the cohesion and thematic clarity suggest deliberate, thoughtful construction rather than constraint-driven assembly.</comment>
