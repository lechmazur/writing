<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber’s grief-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and his calm, methodical demeanor aligns with his diplomat background; however, Silas is underdeveloped and lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a strong arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the pacing is tight and logical, though the climax feels slightly rushed in its resolution.</comment>
