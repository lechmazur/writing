<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the action of crafting the prophecy drives the plot, though the stakes remain subtle and internal rather than external.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details like dust motes and bergamot tea enhancing the mood; the palace’s silence and decay mirror Tian’s introspective task beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is memorable and layered with metaphor and subtext; the butterfly motif and floral energy suggest deeper themes of transformation and control over fate, though the tension is more philosophical than dramatic.</comment>
