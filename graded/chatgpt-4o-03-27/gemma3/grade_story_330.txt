<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s arc is emotionally resonant and consistent; his dejection, guilt, and vow-driven purpose are clearly conveyed through action and internal reflection, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing slightly falters in the middle, and the transition to the vow feels a touch abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original metaphors and a unique setting elevate the piece, though some phrasing borders on ornate and a few transitions feel slightly formulaic or AI-adjacent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite minor pacing and stylistic issues, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich, with a strong sense of purpose and closure.</comment>
