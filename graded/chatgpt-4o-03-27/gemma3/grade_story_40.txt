<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber is richly developed with a clear arc from resignation to emotional reawakening; Clara’s motivations are also well-drawn, though her character is less nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and emotionally satisfying, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the reincarnation detail feels underutilized and extraneous to the main arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail; the decaying library and storm enhance the mood and mirror the characters’ emotional states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with strong symbolism (toy soldier, pudding); the ending is subtle yet powerful, though some metaphors verge on overuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh voice and original premise; some elements (e.g., reincarnation) feel more ornamental than essential, but the emotional core is authentic and avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and emotional payoff; the story feels complete and thoughtful, though a few assigned elements feel lightly integrated rather than fully embedded.</comment>
