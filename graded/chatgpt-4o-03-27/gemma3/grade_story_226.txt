<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tiber’s grief-driven motivation is deeply felt and consistent; his actions—crafting boxes, bartering for spectral access—are aligned with his sorrow and obsession, though his emotional arc remains static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing slightly lags during the facility sequence, and transitions could be smoother.</comment>
