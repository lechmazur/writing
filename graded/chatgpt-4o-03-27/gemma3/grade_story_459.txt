<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arthur’s motivations are subtly and consistently developed, with his ghost-seeing and emotional detachment aligning well with his internal arc; however, his “elegantly clumsy” trait is underutilized and doesn’t meaningfully shape his actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional progression and resolution; the pacing is deliberate and coherent, though the ghost tour method feels under-integrated into the plot’s momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sand castle lab is vividly rendered and thematically resonant, with sensory details (lavender scent, brittle petals) enhancing the atmosphere; the setting deeply supports the tone and character’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose, strong symbolism (petal decay, silence), and a poignant emotional shift create a lasting impact; the story shows rather than tells, though the conflict remains subtle and may feel too understated for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story, though a few transitions (e.g., from ghost tours to flower crown) feel slightly mechanical; overall, the voice is distinct and avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich, with most elements serving the narrative organically; minor underuse of certain assigned elements slightly detracts from full integration.</comment>
