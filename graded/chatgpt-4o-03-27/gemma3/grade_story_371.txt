<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jax’s motivations are clearly defined and consistently reflected in his actions; his voice is distinct, and his emotional core—protecting kindness—adds depth, though more direct interaction with others could enhance dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc and satisfying progression; however, the marble-to-pressure-plate connection feels slightly underdeveloped and could benefit from more clarity or buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere that supports tone and theme; the market’s apathy contrasts effectively with Jax’s quiet hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite the constraints, the story feels complete and emotionally resonant, with a strong thematic throughline and creative integration of elements, though a few connections could be more organically developed.</comment>
