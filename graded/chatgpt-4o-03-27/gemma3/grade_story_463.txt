<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tiber is sharply drawn with consistent motivations rooted in grief and duty; his dry wit and rigidity contrast well with Elara’s fluidity, though Elara’s inner life is less developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with the rope incident catalyzing a shift; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the ending, while resonant, feels a touch abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric—salt, regret, nautical charts—and deeply entwined with the themes of memory and decay; sensory detail is evocative and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrent, layered symbolism (rope, lighthouse, list), and subtle subtext about grief and control; dialogue is spare but effective, though the theme could be slightly more distilled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in tone and metaphor, with fresh imagery and emotional nuance; a few phrases verge on the overly poetic, but overall avoids cliché and demonstrates clear authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive, with all elements serving the central theme of broken promises and emotional containment; the brevity feels intentional, not limiting.</comment>
