<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation is emotionally grounded and consistent, with his grandfather’s disappearance providing a compelling personal stake; however, his personality as a "bleary-eyed physician" is underutilized beyond the opening line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical progression, with the cutlass and coffee grounds leading naturally to the temple journey; however, the climax feels slightly rushed and lacks a strong resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory details and a mystical tone that supports the narrative; the digital nomad camp is underdeveloped but doesn’t detract significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cutlass, coffee grounds), emotional resonance, and thematic depth; the story effectively shows rather than tells, though the ending could carry more emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some elements (coffee divination, digital nomad camp) feel slightly ornamental or under-integrated, but the story avoids clichés and demonstrates a mostly original voice with fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Despite minor underuse of some assigned elements, the story is cohesive, emotionally engaging, and thematically rich, with a strong sense of purpose and atmosphere.</comment>
