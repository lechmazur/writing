<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber is a well-drawn character with a distinct voice, consistent motivations, and symbolic actions that align with his role as a dream-decoding underdog; Elara adds depth, though her arc is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the uprising's subtlety is well-executed, though the transition from dream analysis to map revelation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant; the decaying spaceport, flickering countdown, and filtered sunlight all reinforce the atmosphere of latent rebellion and forgotten potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., crimson feather, microscope, countdown); the story evokes quiet tension and thematic depth, though some emotional beats could be more sharply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors and a unique tone; avoids clich√©s and demonstrates stylistic control, though a few phrases verge on poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and layered for its length; the story lingers with a sense of quiet revolution and symbolic resonance, though a slightly more emotionally grounded climax would elevate it further.</comment>
