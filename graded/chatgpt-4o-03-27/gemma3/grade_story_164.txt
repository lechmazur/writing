<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber is vividly drawn, with his wistfulness and quiet defiance shaping every action; his motivation to "remember" lost nature is consistent and compelling, though the secondary character is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the introduction of the seed pod provides a subtle but effective resolution, though the pacing slightly lingers in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cyberpunk arcade is richly rendered with sensory detail and contrasts beautifully with the organic imagery; the setting enhances both mood and theme without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (dust as memory, seed as hope); the story evokes quiet emotion and reflection, though the dialogue is minimal and could deepen the impact with more interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original concept and execution; the dust-mapping method and botanical sketches feel fresh and specific, with no reliance on clich√© or formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant, cohesive, and emotionally resonant; the story feels complete and lingers in the mind, though a slightly stronger emotional climax could elevate it further.</comment>
