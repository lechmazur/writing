<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn through her physical expression and internal conflict; her muteness and mimicry are well-integrated, though her sharp-wittedness is more implied than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and emotionally resonant, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the prophecy and dance progression are well-paced, though the family photo element feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and symbolic, with strong sensory details (lavender, bubbles, metallic patch); the chamber’s psychological function enhances the mood and theme effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the elements serve the story rather than dominate it, and the narrative lingers with thematic depth and stylistic clarity.</comment>
