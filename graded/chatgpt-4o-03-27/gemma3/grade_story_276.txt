<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Both Tiber and Thorne are rendered with emotional depth and evolving motivations; their subtle transformations feel earned and consistent, though Thorne’s voice could be slightly more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear shift in Tiber’s role; however, the pacing around the climax (the thermos moment) feels slightly rushed.</comment>
