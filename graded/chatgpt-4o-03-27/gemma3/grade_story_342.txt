<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tiber’s motivations are clearly tied to his internal void and desire for order; his actions—following the postcards, interpreting memories—align with this. His voice is distinct, though his “careless pilot” trait is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc: mystery, exploration, revelation, and resolution. The pacing is well-managed, and the cause-effect logic of the postcards and memory-sharing grove is coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grove is richly atmospheric, with sensory detail and tone enhancing the dreamy, eerie mood. The setting is deeply integrated with the plot and character’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext; the story explores identity and memory with emotional resonance. The ending is subtle yet satisfying, and the prose is lyrical without excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original concept and execution; avoids clichés and shows stylistic control. Some metaphors verge on familiar, but overall the story feels fresh and human, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant. The elements serve the narrative rather than feeling imposed. Leaves a lingering impression of melancholy and quiet hope.</comment>
