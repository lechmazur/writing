<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara and Tiber are distinct, emotionally resonant characters with clear motivations and consistent actions; Elara’s empathic nature is well-integrated, though Tiber’s arc could use slightly more depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, though the marionette’s role as a map could be more clearly developed to strengthen cause-effect clarity.</comment>
