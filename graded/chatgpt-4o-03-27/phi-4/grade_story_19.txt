<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara has a clear motivation and symbolic actions, but her personality lacks depth beyond archetypal traits; her "feral ranger" identity is underdeveloped and not meaningfully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the plot is minimal and leans heavily on symbolism rather than narrative tension or development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but the writing occasionally veers into generic phrasing and lacks the nuance or surprise of top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but feels more like a poetic vignette than a fully realized narrative; it lingers, but lightly.</comment>
