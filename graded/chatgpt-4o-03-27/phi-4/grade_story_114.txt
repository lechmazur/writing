<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the logic connecting the coffee grinder, frames, and coral reefs is tenuous and overly abstract, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and thematic ambition, but moments of vague abstraction and slightly ornate phrasing suggest formulaic tendencies and lack of stylistic precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Inventive and thematically rich, but the story’s cohesion suffers from overly symbolic logic and a lack of grounded emotional detail; still, it leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
