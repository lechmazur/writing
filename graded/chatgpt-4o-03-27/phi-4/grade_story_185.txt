<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias is intriguing and consistent, but his emotional depth and transformation are underdeveloped; his motivation is poetic but abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story has a thematic arc but lacks a clear narrative progression or conflict-resolution structure; it reads more like a character sketch than a plot-driven piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and atmosphere, but the story feels more like a meditation than a fully realized narrative; memorable but not fully satisfying.</comment>
