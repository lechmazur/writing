<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jamie's motivation is intriguing and consistent, but the character lacks depth and specificity beyond the archetype of a fallen star seeking transcendence; emotional nuance is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and thematic resolution, but transitions between scenes (especially from chamber to cathedral) feel abrupt and underexplained, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cathedral is evocative and atmospheric, but the vibration analysis chamber is underutilized and disconnected from the rest of the setting, diluting immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly in the stained glass and ambition theme, but emotional stakes remain abstract and the prose occasionally veers into vagueness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and a unique premise, but moments of generic phrasing and tonal inconsistency suggest a lack of fully realized authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is conceptually rich and thematically ambitious, but uneven execution and underdeveloped transitions prevent it from achieving top-tier cohesion and impact.</comment>
