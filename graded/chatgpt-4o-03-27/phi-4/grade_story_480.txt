<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The exorcist’s motivation is stated clearly and aligns with their actions, but their personality remains abstract and underdeveloped; the “quietly loud” trait is not meaningfully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot lacks tension or stakes; the method of infiltrating clubs is mentioned but not shown, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and consistent, with strong sensory cues in the mess hall and music hall, though the setting could be more dynamically integrated into the action.</comment>
