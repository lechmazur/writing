<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The statue's motivation is clear and consistent, but its emotional arc remains static; the telepathy adds depth, yet the character lacks evolution or complexity beyond its symbolic role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is overly even—lacking tension or escalation—and the action feels more observational than dynamic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steam-powered setting is evocative and supports the mood well; sensory details are sparse but effective, and the atmosphere aligns with the statue’s emotional tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story evokes quiet reflection and uses metaphor effectively, but it leans heavily on exposition over dramatization, limiting emotional immediacy and narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the premise is original, the execution occasionally lapses into abstract or generic phrasing; some metaphors feel ornamental rather than integral to the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but lacks the narrative risk or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary level; emotional resonance is present but muted.</comment>
