<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her loyalty to her mission is well portrayed, but her personality lacks depth beyond her purpose, and her emotional responses feel somewhat generalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying resolution, but the connection between the poster, the straw, and the quest feels tenuous, and the pacing is slightly uneven in the middle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors and phrasing feel slightly generic or AI-like, and while the premise is original, the execution leans on familiar narrative beats without surprising turns or deep nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, with a clear theme and emotional undercurrent, but it doesn’t fully transcend its structure or deliver a lasting impression at the highest literary level.</comment>
