<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias has a consistent motivation and a gentle, reflective personality, but lacks depth or complexity; his whimsicality is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a beginning and end, but the middle lacks tension or progression; the plot feels more like a mood piece than a narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues, though the "reimagined" aspect of the temple is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some fresh phrasing and imagery, but also signs of formulaic structure and vague abstractions; lacks the unpredictability of human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Competent and cohesive, with a clear theme, but not striking or memorable enough for top-tier publication; emotional and narrative stakes are too low.</comment>
