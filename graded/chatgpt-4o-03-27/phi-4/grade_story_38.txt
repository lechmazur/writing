<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing feels uneven, and the connection between the attic and subway timeframe is conceptually interesting but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The haunted attic is richly atmospheric with strong sensory detail, effectively supporting the tone and theme, though the subway element feels more symbolic than integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but it doesnâ€™t fully transcend its premise or deliver a lasting emotional or intellectual resonance.</comment>
