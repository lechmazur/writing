<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Some phrases feel formulaic or overly polished; the story avoids clich√©s but lacks the unpredictability or nuance of truly original fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, but it feels more like a mood piece than a fully realized narrative; it leaves a faint impression rather than a lasting one.</comment>
