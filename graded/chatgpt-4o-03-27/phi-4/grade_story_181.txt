<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eliana has a clear motivation and a few distinct traits, but her personality feels more told than shown; her "blatantly secretive" nature is asserted but not dramatized through action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying resolution, but the pacing is uneven and the climax (the kiss moment) feels emotionally unearned and narratively abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting is evocative and sensory details are present, but the connection between setting and plot feels more aesthetic than integral; the atmosphere supports tone but lacks full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>There are moments of emotional resonance and symbolic imagery (e.g., the flower), but the story leans heavily on exposition and lacks subtext or tension; the kiss moment feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining elements, but the prose occasionally veers into generic phrasing and the emotional beats follow predictable patterns; lacks a distinctive voice or surprising insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and the elements are mostly integrated, but it feels constructed around prompts rather than organically developed; the ending is thoughtful but not deeply affecting.</comment>
