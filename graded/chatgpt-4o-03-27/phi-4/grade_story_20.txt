<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict is clear and her motivations are consistent, but her personality traits—especially "anxiously calm"—are more told than shown, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the transition from regret to clarity feels slightly rushed and overly tidy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inverted waterfall and celestial timeframe create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that mirrors Elara’s emotional state and enhances the story’s tone and symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly the comb and the bridge, but emotional impact is somewhat muted by abstract phrasing and lack of visceral detail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some originality in imagery and concept, but the prose occasionally leans into generic phrasing and lacks the unpredictability or nuance of top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its emotional and stylistic execution falls short of the polish expected for elite publication.</comment>
