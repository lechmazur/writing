<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliot’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his emotional depth and distinctiveness are underdeveloped; he lacks a truly unique voice or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is overly uniform and lacks tension; the “final countdown” feels abstract rather than urgent.</comment>
