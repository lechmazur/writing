<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, but her personality lacks depth beyond her symbolic actions; her voice is indistinct and largely filtered through narration rather than character-driven choices or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the storm as a catalyst feels more metaphorical than functional, and the pacing, while steady, leans on abstraction over concrete cause-effect progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some originality in the clothespin symbolism and storm ritual, but the prose occasionally veers into generic abstraction and lacks the specificity or surprise needed to elevate it above familiar tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but its emotional and narrative impact is muted by a lack of vivid detail, character nuance, and narrative risk.</comment>
