<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eli’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond archetypal yearning; “earnestly deceptive” is underexplored and not meaningfully integrated into his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but transitions between plot points feel abrupt and underdeveloped; the lantern’s mystery drives the plot but lacks a strong causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The biodome and Martian setting are evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail; however, the “bookshop mysteries” element feels more decorative than integral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and thematic ambition, but moments of generic phrasing and vague emotional beats suggest formulaic tendencies; “ephemeral cameo appearances” is underutilized and unclear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but lacks the narrative sharpness and emotional resonance required for top-tier publication; promising but not fully realized.</comment>
