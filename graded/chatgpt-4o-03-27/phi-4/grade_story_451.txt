<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Alex’s motivation is conceptually intriguing but underdeveloped; emotional depth and psychological nuance are lacking, and the actors remain flat, serving more as plot devices than characters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes (market to mountain) feel abrupt, and the logic of hiring actors to uncover identity is not convincingly integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Several elements feel formulaic or generically mystical; the prose leans toward vague abstraction, and the originality of the premise is diluted by predictable execution and transitions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story is conceptually ambitious and structurally complete, but lacks the stylistic precision, emotional depth, and originality required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
