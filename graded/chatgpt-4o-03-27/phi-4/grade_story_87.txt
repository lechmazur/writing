<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The character's emotional arc is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks specificity beyond abstract descriptors; her "hyperactively serene" trait is not convincingly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but the action is internalized to the point of near stasis; the pacing is meditative but risks monotony.</comment>
