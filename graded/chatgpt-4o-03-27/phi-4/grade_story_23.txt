<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s motivation is clearly stated and her actions align with it, but her personality lacks depth beyond poetic descriptors; her voice is lyrical but not distinctively human or emotionally complex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the concept is original, the execution leans into poetic generalities and familiar metaphors; some phrasing feels formulaic or overly ornate, reducing emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, but lacks the narrative tension or character complexity expected at the highest literary level; it feels more like a tone piece than a fully realized story.</comment>
