<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliot is sketched with some emotional depth and symbolic purpose, but his motivations and personality traits (like "professionally wild") are more told than shown, and his voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot feels more thematic than driven by action; the pacing is steady, though the emotional stakes remain low due to minimal conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but the execution feels safe and occasionally generic; metaphors are serviceable but not striking, and emotional nuance is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the narrative risk or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
