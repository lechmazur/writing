<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond archetypal yearning; her “openly private” nature is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transformation feels abrupt; cause and effect are mostly logical, though the pacing slightly rushes the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally told rather than shown; overall style is competent but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtfully constructed, with creative use of elements, but lacks the complexity or surprise needed for top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
