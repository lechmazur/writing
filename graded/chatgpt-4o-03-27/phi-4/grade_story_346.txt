<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thalos has a clear arc and motivation, but his transformation feels more symbolic than emotionally grounded; his "intimately impersonal" trait is intriguing but underexplored in action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven and some transitions feel abstract rather than causally driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Inventive and thematically cohesive, but the story leans heavily on metaphor at the expense of emotional immediacy and narrative clarity.</comment>
