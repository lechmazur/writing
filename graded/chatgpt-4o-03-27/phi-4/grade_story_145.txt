<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliana’s motivation is noble and consistent, but her personality remains vague; her transformation lacks depth and emotional nuance, and her voice is indistinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is overly smooth—conflict is minimal, and the stakes feel abstract rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but it plays safe—missing the complexity, surprise, or emotional resonance expected at the highest level.</comment>
