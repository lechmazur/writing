<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The assassin's motivation is abstract but consistent; however, his personality lacks depth beyond poetic detachment, and his emotional arc feels more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the method of assassination via camera lens strains plausibility and the pacing is slightly uneven in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the setting enhances the tone and mirrors the assassinâ€™s internal state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, with a lingering mood, but lacks the emotional or intellectual punch needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
