<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eli’s dreamy nature and borrowed memories are intriguing, but his motivation and emotional arc feel underdeveloped; his transformation lacks sufficient internal conflict or specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot progression is more atmospheric than driven by cause-effect logic; the action of investigating postcards feels passive rather than propulsive.</comment>
