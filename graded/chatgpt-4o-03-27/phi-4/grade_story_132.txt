<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finn’s consciously impulsive nature is stated and somewhat reflected in his actions, but his internal transformation feels underdeveloped and lacks emotional nuance or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from discovery to village-wide transformation feels rushed and overly convenient within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mushroom village and forest cabin are evocative, but sensory detail is sparse and the setting feels more decorative than integral to the plot’s emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but the language occasionally veers into generic phrasing and the narrative arc follows a predictable redemptive pattern without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competently structured and thematically coherent, but lacks the stylistic distinction, emotional depth, and narrative risk required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
