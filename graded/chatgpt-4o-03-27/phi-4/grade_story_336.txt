<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal development remains static; we see his burden and hope, but not enough transformation or complexity to elevate him beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the action of "imprisoning darkness" is metaphorical and underexplored, leaving the climax emotionally muted and lacking narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues and symbolic resonance; however, the integration of modern and ancient elements (car backfire vs. palace) feels slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story evokes mood and uses symbolism effectively, but lacks narrative tension and emotional depth; the prose leans toward telling rather than showing, limiting its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels formulaic or overly ornate, and the emotional beats are often stated rather than shown; while the concept is original, execution lacks nuance and surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a strong sense of purpose, but it doesn't fully transcend its premise or deliver a lasting emotional or intellectual impression.</comment>
