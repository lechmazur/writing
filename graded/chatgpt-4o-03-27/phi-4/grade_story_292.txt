<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The raider’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality—especially the “stubbornly open-minded” trait—is underdeveloped and not meaningfully explored through action or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is overly smooth and lacks tension; transitions are seamless but sometimes feel too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The speakeasy setting is atmospheric, but sensory detail is sparse and the world feels more symbolic than lived-in; the midnight timeframe adds tone but little narrative weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors (e.g., the mug as a map) are effective, but the writing occasionally lapses into generic phrasing and lacks stylistic distinctiveness or surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, but it plays safe with structure and theme; it lacks the boldness or stylistic edge expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
