<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara is gently sketched with a clear motivation and symbolic object, but her internal arc lacks depth and complexity; her reactions feel idealized rather than psychologically rich.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the arrival of strangers and their integration feels too convenient, with minimal tension or conflict to drive momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the prose avoids clich√©s and maintains a consistent tone, it leans toward generic lyricism and lacks the stylistic distinctiveness or surprise of top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and pleasant, but plays it safe; it lacks the daring or complexity expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
