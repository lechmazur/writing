<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Marquess’s submissiveness masks sharp perception and moral resolve, creating a layered character whose choices and demeanor are intricately tied to his motivations and voice; minor ambiguity remains in emotional depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story arcs cleanly from discovery to subversion, maintaining strong cause-effect logic and tension; pacing is deftly handled within word constraints, though the climax verges on overly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The estate’s whimsical-yet-menacing “secret agent workshop” and the garden setting create a vivid, tonally complex world; rich atmospheric detail heightens mood and tension effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose, ironic tone, and layered metaphors (like pruning vs. disruption) reveal theme and subtext; the story lingers with emotional weight despite brevity, though emotional stakes could deepen further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive, atmospheric, and thoughtfully layered; elegant integration of theme and character within constraints, with just a hint of contrivance in execution that prevents a perfect score.</comment>
