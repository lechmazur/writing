<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is abstract but coherent—tracing transformation through ritual and symbolism; the progression from guilt to self-erasure is clear and thematically resolved, though certain transitions are elliptical and may challenge less attentive readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is richly evoked, blending the scientific and the sacred; imagery and atmosphere are immersive and support tone, character, and theme with remarkable unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story achieves deep resonance through metaphor, motif, and structure; emotional weight is conveyed with restraint and layered imagery, though treading close to abstraction may slightly impede clarity for some readers.</comment>
