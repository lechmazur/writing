<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's arc from cynical survivor to purposeful protector is emotionally resonant and largely consistent; Lys’s shift is subtler but believable. Dialog reveals motive effectively, though some reactions verge on archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively tight given the word limit—with strong causal flow and resolution. The reactor, charcoal, and warlords interweave logically. A few transitions are slightly compressed but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater lab is vivid and immersive, with sensory details enhancing the eerie, drowned-world tone. The bioluminescence and salt-crusted ruins elevate mood and reinforce theme. Atmosphere supports character and plot elegantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story’s emotional undertow is powerful, with layered subtext—charcoal as motif, ghosts as metaphor. Dialogue is sharp, symbolism refined, and the ending achieves quiet catharsis. A masterful use of literary economy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While using some familiar tropes (post-collapse genius/protector), the execution subverts cliché with unique detail and focused prose. Emotional nuance and imagery are mostly fresh though some lines brush melodrama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A high degree of cohesion and literary craft—each element serves the narrative rather than feeling assigned. The nuance, symbolism, and emotional arc linger, showing clear authorial control despite brevity.</comment>
