<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The trapper’s actions are consistently driven by loss-turned-purpose, and his motivations are keenly aligned with his past and environment; inner monologue and imagery reveal a haunted, resourceful survivor with a compelling personal arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Despite the abstract premise, the story maintains a coherent arc from recommencement to resolution; some plot elements remain symbolically dense or underdeveloped, but progression is logical and thematic resolution clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—metal tang, static, sea glass, black hole hum—all evoked through vivid sensory details; tone and setting strongly reinforce motivation and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors, thematic resonance, and layered subtext convey grief, perseverance, and transformation: the writing shows rather than tells, with emotional weight emerging from action and symbol.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strikingly original in metaphor and concept, with little sign of formulaic structure; occasional overly ornate phrasing (“gears groaned like living things”) borders on purple prose but mostly serves the tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and artistically ambitious piece; each element appears chosen with care, and the narrative evokes reflection—it lingers through mood, voice, and symbolism.</comment>
