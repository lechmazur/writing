<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s motivations are clearly tied to her traumatic past and obsession with lost stardom; her descent into madness/magic is believably fueled by her background, though her arc could benefit from more subtlety in emotional evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story progresses logically from map to revelation to transformation, maintaining a coherent arc and strong pacing despite its surreal tone; resolution feels earned, though some transitions are intentionally disorienting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly layered, with the cathedral’s sensory and symbolic details enhancing both setting and theme; the integration of vibration, sound, and stained glass adds immersive depth and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dense with striking imagery, layered metaphors, and subtext about art, fame, and madness; the ending effectively reframes Lila’s identity without over-explaining, and literary devices elevate the story’s emotional and intellectual impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, metaphors are fresh, and the narrative avoids formulaic tropes; while occasionally dense, the style feels intentional and supports the surreal intensity rather than detracting from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong cohesion among elements, vivid writing, and a resonant thematic core make this feel like a complete, publish-worthy work despite slight overindulgence in stylization; lingers meaningfully beyond its length.</comment>
