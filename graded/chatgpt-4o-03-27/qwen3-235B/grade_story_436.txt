<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apothecaryâ€™s sorrow is vividly expressed through symbolic actions and internal sacrifice, with motivations deeply tied to familial loss and desperation; character voice is consistent and layered, though not deeply interactive with others.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc flows with urgency and resolution within word constraints; escalation from relic-holding to cosmic transformation is coherent and purposeful despite surrealism. A masterfully compact plot, though a touch overloaded at the climax.</comment>
