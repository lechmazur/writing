<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila is vividly drawn with a consistent voice, her motivations aligning neatly with her past and present actions; her arrogance, intellect, and chaotic urges feel authentic and drive the narrative effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Though the plot borders on surreal and nonlinear, the arc is surprisingly complete—chaos as catalyst, climax, and conclusion—but coherence occasionally strains under stylistic density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imaginative and immersive, with atmospheric details (ink-black fog, spectral hush, melting walls) enhancing tone and reinforcing the story’s surreal metaphysics.</comment>
