<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The character is deeply motivated by personal loss, and their arc—from grief to reluctant leadership—feels emotionally authentic and consistent; the softly militant resolve is subtly expressed through action and imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong internal logic and a clear arc from object acquisition to alliance-building; the coercion via revelation is particularly well-crafted, but resolution borders on slightly idealized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Evocative atmospheric detail—the rooftop farm, crumbling city, ash-choked skies—creates a vivid, immersive world that reinforces the themes of survival, loss, and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism abound; emotional undertones are complex and earned, particularly the transition from mourning to purposeful action; prose is lyrical without excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Almost entirely fresh in approach and voice; while heightened in tone, the language is specific and purposeful; there’s a rare balance of precision and emotional weight throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cohesive, textured, and layered; the narrative feels authored rather than constructed, with high integration of all elements and a resonant closing image that lingers.</comment>
