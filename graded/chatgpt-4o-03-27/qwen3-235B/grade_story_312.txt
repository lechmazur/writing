<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is compelling and consistent; the agoraphobia subtly underscores every choice without being overstated. His evolution is emotionally resonant and believably portrayed through interaction with the snuffbox and the setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arc is complete and satisfying within the word limit. The pacing is masterful, with each event logically flowing into the next. The crack of the snuffbox clearly shifts the story’s momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric worldbuilding is richly immersive; the sensory details (wet dust, mildew, whispering sand) create a haunting tone that perfectly reflects the internal tension and themes of duty and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative and poetic language deepens the story’s emotional layering. Symbolism is dense but controlled. The conclusion offers catharsis and thematic clarity without being too neat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking originality in metaphor and motif. Language is deliberately ornate but rarely excessive. The rain’s rhythm and the twin snuffboxes offer fresh metaphoric weight without feeling derivative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and resonant piece. The brief form feels intentional, not restrictive. Ambitious and nearly flawless in execution; a few slightly dense phrases could be streamlined for clarity.</comment>
