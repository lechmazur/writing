<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s ambivalence and emotional paradox are richly drawn and consistent, with their motivation (to disrupt a system they alone understand) stemming naturally from their character; however, their interiority flirts with abstraction at times, slightly distancing reader empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves strong coherence and a clear arc within its tight scope, with the marbles-to-scoreboard-defragmentation process anchoring plot progression; still, the climax's metaphysical execution may feel just abstract enough to soften narrative tension slightly.</comment>
