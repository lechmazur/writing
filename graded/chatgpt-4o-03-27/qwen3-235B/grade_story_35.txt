<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is deeply rendered through action and internal transformation, with his quiet demeanor and emotional repression shaping a richly believable arc; however, some transitions in his psychological state are slightly compressed due to length constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story forms a near-seamless narrative loop with a strong emotional resolution, though a few moments rely too heavily on poetic transitions at the expense of clear causal development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and tangible—the retreat, the garden, and the hall shimmer with sensory precision; minor abstraction in some imagery slightly clouds spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The emotional resonance is profound and layered; symbolism is deftly handled, subtext potent, and the resolution artfully understated while thematically rich.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché and formula; the metaphors are fresh and thematically grounded, though one or two phrasings teeter near ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally intelligent piece with literary ambition that largely succeeds; a slightly more grounded midpoint would elevate its clarity without sacrificing lyricism.</comment>
