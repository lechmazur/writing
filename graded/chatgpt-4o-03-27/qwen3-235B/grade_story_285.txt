<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hesitant swordsman’s internal conflict is deftly portrayed through symbolic action and physical awkwardness, but his motivations could be rendered with slightly greater clarity and complexity to fully resonate emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc—world-bridging through ritual, confrontation with the queen, resolution via symbolic action—is coherent and satisfying; however, some transitions, particularly the re-emergence and final emotional beat, feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The world is strikingly original, with geothermal vents, mirrored orchards, and hermit crab rituals forming a surreal, immersive atmosphere that powerfully supports tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, rich symbolism, and thematic resonance give the piece strong literary impact; the storytelling reflects purpose and care, though the emotional climax could deepen slightly with more dialogue nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The narrative subverts tropes inventively—crabs as liminal guides, a swordsman who bridges rather than battles—and the language, while lush, stops short of purple; emotional cues are shown with poetic control rather than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels thoughtfully composed rather than constrained by prompts; it leaves a lasting mood, though a slightly fuller sense of character psychology would enhance its reflection capacity.</comment>
