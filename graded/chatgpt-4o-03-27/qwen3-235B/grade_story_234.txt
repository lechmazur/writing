<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is contemplative rather than event-driven but achieves a resonant emotional resolution. Some may find the external plot faint, yet thematic unity and internal logic provide cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and immersive—dinosaur bones, moonlight, and sundial imagery blend into a surreal whole that enhances emotional tone and supports thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s metaphors, tone, and symbolism are powerful and sustained. It evokes emotion and philosophical reflection, although the minimal action and overt lyricism may risk alienating less patient readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking originality in concept, language, and thematic execution. Not formulaic, though the poetic density occasionally toes the line of over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A quietly stunning piece that blends theme, character, and style with unusual grace. It leaves a resonant impression, despite its near-total lack of dialogue or traditional action.</comment>
