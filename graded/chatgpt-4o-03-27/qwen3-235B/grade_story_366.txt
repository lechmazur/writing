<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is lucid and emotionally resonant; her actions, quirks, and psychic abilities deeply align with her pursuit, though her voice, while consistent, lacks a striking uniqueness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise and execution are strikingly original with minimal cliché; there’s some density in metaphor but it shows genuine authorial voice and avoids common AI pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This is a tightly woven narrative with depth, atmosphere, and purpose; its brevity feels earned, not constrained, and its emotional resonance lingers well beyond the final image.</comment>
