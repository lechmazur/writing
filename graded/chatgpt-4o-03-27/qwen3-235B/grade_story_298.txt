<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is vividly portrayed, with his rational impulsiveness and emotional mimicry providing both motivation and thematic depth; his transformation into others reveals a layered internal world, though his backstory remains somewhat opaque.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot unfolds in a tight arc—layered and nonlinear, yet coherent—using the cold-case framework effectively to build mystery and resolution in a compressed space; a few transitions could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and emotionally resonant, with rich textural detail (e.g., fractured moonlight, dust-cloaked debris) enhancing tone and reinforcing the post-apocalyptic decay and grief-laden atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and metaphor (e.g., dress as memory, voice as resurrection), with layered emotional impact and haunting imagery; the ending offers convergence of theme and emotion with lasting poignancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strikingly original voice and concept; avoids tropes while offering unique sensory and emotional textures; a touch of overwrought language slightly edges toward purple prose in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Complex elements are woven with clarity and purpose, and the narrative lingers emotionally and thematically; ambitious, yet mostly controlled execution shows clear literary intent.</comment>
