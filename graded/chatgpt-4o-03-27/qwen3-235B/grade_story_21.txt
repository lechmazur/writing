<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The diplomat is compellingly rendered through fragmentary memories, symbolic objects, and moral ambiguity; motivations align with actions, though emotional transformation at the end slightly rushes a complex arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot cleverly unfolds within constraints, each beat driven by action and memory; the genetic revelation and familial twist land well, though pacing near climax feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional—sensory detail (mildew, moss, must) envelops each scene with tone-mirroring decay; setting and time reinforce the themes with eerie cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance and symbolic layering; metaphors like “vengeance is a root” are potent, though the emotional coda verges on melodrama without full reflective depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, textured language largely avoids cliché; subversions feel purposeful, though a few moments—including the final question—lean toward the poetically expected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Unity of theme, character, and tone elevates the narrative; ending lingers effectively, leaving unresolved moral tension and haunting imagery that reward rereading.</comment>
