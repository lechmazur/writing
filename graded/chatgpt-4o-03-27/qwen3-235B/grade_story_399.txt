<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thaddeus is vividly drawn with consistent grumpiness and weariness; his motivation—to seek understanding of internal unrest—emerges naturally; his arc from bitterness to quiet resolution is emotionally convincing and nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying, cyclical arc with strong cause-effect links; pacing is controlled, though the buildup is slightly dense in metaphor-heavy sections which occasionally obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Beautiful use of metaphor and symbolism; the sand mandala as emotional cartography is masterful; strong resonance and lasting thematic impact through lyrical yet purposeful prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original voice and poetic language; a few metaphors verge on purple, but most are elegant; strong emotional nuance and fresh interpretation of tired tropes like the occult caretaker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nearly every element feels intrinsic, with a deliberate structure and profound thematic layering; stylistic ambition is high but mostly earned by original execution and emotional clarity.</comment>
