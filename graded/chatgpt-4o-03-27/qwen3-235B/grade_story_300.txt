<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Callista’s drive is convincingly rooted in her brother’s death, and her resourcefulness and sarcasm give her a distinct voice, though more internal conflict or evolution would deepen complexity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly evoked through sensory detail and historical texture; the atmosphere supports tone and theme with symbols like the serpentine amphora and humming engine beneath ancient ruins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong literary craft—vivid imagery, layered symbolism, and a compelling theme about ambition and sacrifice—but emotional resonance is slightly muted by the narrator’s distance and brevity of scenes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive, eloquent, and memorable; the story lingers through its mysterious tone and visual lyricism, though its depth might benefit from more emotional intimacy or complication of motive.</comment>
