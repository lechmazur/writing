<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent internal logic supports the character's blend of defiance and guilt; their layered identity and motivations are rich but could gain from sharper dialogue or a moment of emotional contradiction to elevate authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arc is coherent with elegant loops between past dares and present rebellion, but the climax feels fractionally rushed—resolution lands more on symbolism than concrete consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and inventive—details like the AI's voice retaining lost tongues and the biodome’s sensory depth build an atmosphere that seamlessly supports tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional undertow, deft symbolism in linguistic extinction as rebellion, and a nuanced final image linger; literary devices are vivid but never excessive, with subtext enriching nearly every line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mostly avoids formula, with fresh metaphors and a distinct stylistic voice; a few turns of phrase ("vanishing languages into a rusted recorder") skirt conventional imagery but overall feel earned and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Complex yet cohesive, the story juggles layered elements with skill; the overall structure supports thematic depth without feeling constrained by word count—reads like a fragment of a profound whole.</comment>
