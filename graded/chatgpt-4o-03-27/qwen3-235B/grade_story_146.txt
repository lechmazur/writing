<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora is richly drawn with layered motivations—her arc from deception to reluctant prophet is convincing and emotionally resonant, though some interiority is stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly woven with elegant cause-effect momentum; Liora’s visions, the flute, and the crypt form an organic arc. A few transitions demand a second read but payoff is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strikingly cohesive—language, theme, and emotion cohere into a memorable whole; concept-driven without feeling mechanical, and concludes with mythic weight.</comment>
