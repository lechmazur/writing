<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hermit is sharply drawn with a distinct, consistent internal logic—his humor, resourcefulness, and grief-laced routines ground his motivations and reactions with deeply human specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story’s arc is subtle but complete, with a satisfying cause-effect resolution; minor narrative leaps (e.g., bread scent fixing pipes) are poetic rather than logical, but work within the tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The richly sensory world—glowing flora, fungal vaults, scent-reactive lilies—elevates the tone and internal logic, deeply entwined with both plot and character mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, sardonic tone, layered metaphor, and emotional resonance (grief, absurdity, resilience) give the story lasting impact far beyond its word count.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Displays strong authorial voice and emotional nuance; metaphors are fresh, and absurdity is purposeful—only slight indulgence in lyrical density restrains a perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A compelling, cohesive narrative that blends surreal humor, grief, and invention masterfully; it lingers with emotional and thematic depth and stylistic confidence.</comment>
