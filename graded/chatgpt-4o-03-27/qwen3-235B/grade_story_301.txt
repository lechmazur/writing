<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The philosopher's motivation is clearly defined and sustained, his transformation from gardener to ethically dubious experimenter is compelling, and his actions—knitting, drinking, pursuing cosmic insight—are all consistent with his identity, though his internal emotional arc remains abstracted and distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Despite rich imagery, the plot leans more on atmospheric progression than clear cause-effect sequences; transitions are smooth but the end lacks strong narrative resolution, trading coherence for symbolic complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's world is strikingly immersive, with evocative sensory details (sound, texture, surreal visuals) that create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere fully aligned with tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story’s craft is sophisticated, rich in metaphor and subtext; the final image is haunting and memorable, though emotional detachment slightly weakens its impact as character remains an observer rather than a vessel of tension or transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly original in concept, tone, and execution, though the occasionally ornate prose flirts with purple; language is often fresh but occasionally verges on overwrought abstraction, affecting clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story blends disparate elements into a surreal, poetic structure with surprising cohesion; while the narrative resists standard arc structure, its internal logic holds, and its strangeness feels fully intentional.</comment>
