<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story unfolds with mythic logic that feels intentional and cohesive; the progression from clue to transcendence is clear, but the scavenger hunt feels like a faint pretext and slightly disconnected from the conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully immersive—evocative sensory detail, mood, and setting fuse seamlessly; the underwater world and temporal liminality are palpably uncanny yet poetic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong integration of tone, theme, and character; emotionally and symbolically cohesive; the story lingers, though small connective tissue (the scavenger hunt premise) is slightly underused.</comment>
