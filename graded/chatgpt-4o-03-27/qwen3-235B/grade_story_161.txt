<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchardist’s grief-fueled vigilance and obsessive logic feel deeply personal and consistent; his actions align with his backstory, and subtle emotional layers enrich his portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story’s arc is tightly structured and complete within the limit; a few transitions (e.g., from suspicion to action) feel slightly compressed but remain coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking sensory details and metaphor (paper aircraft as prayers, the sterile hangar vs. orchard) create a vivid, immersive contrast that mirrors the orchardist’s emotional dislocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Poetic, layered prose with strong symbolism; the ending is haunting and thematically resonant, with an effective buildup of tension and emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive use of motifs (peacock tail, paper planes); avoids trope-heavy pitfalls through original execution, though the antagonist’s feather lapel borders on symbolic overkill.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Complex yet cohesive and emotionally rich; each element serves the story rather than existing for its own sake, and it lingers as more than just a plot twist.</comment>
