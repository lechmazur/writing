<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sentinel is sharply drawn—dry-witted, grimly purposeful, and consistent in motive and tone. Voice is distinct, and motivation (vengeance through oath-binding dance) is compelling, though some emotional complexity is sacrificed for stylization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc is clear—twelve years of revenge culminating in a final confrontation—executed within tight constraints. The dance-driven climax is effective, but the ending slightly wobbles in shifting from resolution to new ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is richly atmospheric and integral, with sensory detail (salt, seafoam, creaking) enhancing mood. The setting deepens the tension between past oaths and present reckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memorable for its strong style, lyrical precision, and metaphorical depth (rope, dance, ghosts). Ends with suggestive reflection. Minor issue: heavy stylization risks alienating clarity at points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The symbolism (dance/oath, rope/ghost) is vivid and original. Only slight dips into familiar gothic tropes prevent a higher score, but handled with enough freshness to feel intentional, not cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, each element tightly integrated. Tone, pacing, and prose harmonize to create mood and tension. The careful diction suggests deliberate, not constrained, brevity.</comment>
