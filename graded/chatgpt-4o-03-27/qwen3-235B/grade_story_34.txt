<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc—from longing to sacrifice—is coherent and well-paced, with appropriate cause/effect, though a bit dense and potentially opaque near the climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A complex yet beautifully unified story; abstract concepts are integrated meaningfully, and it lingers emotionally, though may challenge clarity for some readers.</comment>
