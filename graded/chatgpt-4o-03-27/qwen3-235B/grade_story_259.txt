<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra and Eli are distinctly drawn, with motivations clearly shaped by their pasts and professions; Veyra’s myth-seeking and Eli’s uneasy pragmatism serve as excellent foils. The characters' voices are subtle but effective, though more internal conflict or emotional depth could elevate them further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc—arrival, conflict, collaboration, resolution—within tight constraints. Some transitions (e.g., going from myth decoding to collaboration) could benefit from slightly smoother development, but the narrative flow is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined, immersive, and deeply interwoven with the story's mood and themes. Sensory details—smog, static, peeling frescoes—are vivid and reinforce the atmosphere of decayed futurism and lingering memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The symbolic embedding of myth in paint and data is powerful; themes of memory, erasure, and legacy rise naturally. Subtext is strong and the final gesture (telescope in coat) is poetic. Slightly uneven pacing in the middle prevents top marks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., souls as stories, myths beneath enamel), original narrative beats, and elegant prose distinguish this from formulaic writing. Dialogue is spare but meaningful. Avoids AI-like mechanical phrasing or generic turns of phrase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements are well-integrated with literary elegance. The story lingers emotionally and thematically—especially around erasure and persistence. Word count feels like a container, not a constraint. A few moments verge on opaque rather than profound.</comment>
