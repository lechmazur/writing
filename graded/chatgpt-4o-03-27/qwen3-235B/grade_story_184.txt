<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's voice is vivid and distinct, motivations tied to memory and imaginative defiance; however, emotional transitions (childhood self, calling) are slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The temporal reversal and footprint discovery offer imaginative structure; some narrative leaps (e.g. final resolution) feel more poetic than logically built.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional sense of place and moodâ€”evocative imagery (crunching salt, oxygen-starved roses) blends seamlessly with cosmic nostalgia.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative, emotionally rich, thematically unified story that embraces risk; a few transitions feel abrupt, but overall cohesion is strong.</comment>
