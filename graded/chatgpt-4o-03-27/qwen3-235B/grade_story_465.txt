<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bard's motivations align well with his personality and actions; his patient, humble demeanor emerges clearly through both behavior and dialogue. The ruler, as a totem of legacy and magic, deepens his character without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well structured, with a satisfying beginning, escalation, and resolution. A few transitions are a touch abrupt, but overall coherence and causality are strong given the word limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, using lyrical language and symbolic detail (the ruler, the stew, the guests) to deliver a strong message on patience, memory, and reclamation of wonder.</comment>
