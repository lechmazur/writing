<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The botanist’s motivation—driven by obsession and legacy—is clear and consistent, with eccentric behavior and dialogue that reflect his 'mad' and 'comically serious' nature; however, secondary character dynamics (e.g., the keeper) could be further developed to enhance contrast and stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is impressively coherent within the word count, with strong cause-and-effect logic and clearly escalating tension; the arc resolves with purposeful ambiguity, though minor transitional moments (e.g., betrayal) feel slightly rushed under the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tea house setting feels vividly strange and layered with sensory and atmospheric detail; the fusion of botany, film, and spectral geography deepens the surreal tone and enhances immersion without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylistically rich with subtext, metaphor, and symbolic layering; themes of obsession, loyalty, and perception are tightly interwoven, though emotional resonance is slightly undercut by brisk pacing and lack of introspective depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative and stylistically distinct with minimal reliance on clichés or formula; metaphors are vivid and original, character reactions retain human nuance, and language is purposeful despite occasional density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, integrating all elements in service of theme and mood; its brevity supports its dreamlike tone, though slight over-compression of emotional beats limits full impact.</comment>
