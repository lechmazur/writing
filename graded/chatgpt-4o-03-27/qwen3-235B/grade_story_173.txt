<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchardist is sharply defined through motivation and sensory memory; his ethos ("remember the fruit") grounds his agency and reveals subtle emotional layers, though first-person voice or deeper introspection could elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within its constraint; each moment logically builds from the last, with clean cause-effect momentum and a satisfying resolution, though the pacing marginally loosens near the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and immersive—salt-crusted desks, jellyfish scrolls, and paradox-burned hands create a vivid sensory world that reinforces theme and tone with precision and originality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense with metaphor, subtext, and thematic resonance; the prose is deliberate and emotionally textured, though the abstract nature of conflict resolution may limit emotional catharsis for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-total avoidance of cliché; metaphors and concepts are specific and inventive. Language choices are original without excess flourish, and emotional beats feel authentic rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic clarity; the elements feel native to the story rather than imposed, and the ending lingers with emotional and narrative weight.</comment>
