<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman's transformation from surliness to serenity is well-motivated by his burden of seeing grief’s pattern; his actions—deciphering the riddle through knotwork—feel rooted in personal history and inherited craft. The arc is emotionally resonant, though slightly lacking in direct emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a remarkable arc within a tight space: beginning in grief, acting through ritual, and resolving in metaphysical understanding. Cause-effect is solid, though the logic can verge on poetic obscurity, risking clarity for atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world is richly rendered and immersive, with the graveyard, wind, yarn, and frost converging into a layered, sensory mood. The setting doesn't just support the tone—it is the tone. Sensory detail is evocative and nearly flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The use of metaphors, symbolic crafting, and thematic layering is masterful. The story is poetic without being overwritten. Emotion simmers rather than shouts, and the motif of weaving as connection is delivered with quiet depth. Ending is understated yet complete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stylistically distinctive and emotionally nuanced, though at times the prose flirts with purple. Some transitions and phrasings risk slipping into recursive poetic tropes, but overall, a strong voice with noticeable originality shows through.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story weaves its many elements into a coherent and affecting narrative. The concepts serve the story, not the reverse. There's a lasting resonance to the metaphor of weaving grief with meaning. Some slight density in language prevents full accessibility.</comment>
