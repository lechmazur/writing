<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered—his rigidity, evolving emotional depth, and the contrast between his logic and empathy arc are sharply drawn; slight ambiguity around his mechanical "arms of steel" prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story delivers a coherent arc with clear transformation, though the pace verges on lyrical detour near the midpoint; the cause-effect relationship between the envelope analysis and the greenhouse's reaction is magical but slightly tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and immersive—graveyard-greenhouse fusion, tactile details, and emotional ambience work in concert; the setting enhances the theme and character journey without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative prose, effective symbolism (light as memory/empathy), and a haunting close produce strong emotional resonance; occasionally edges into overwrought phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original blend of mysticism and steampunk; some phrases verge on ornate, but metaphors are specific, fresh, and rarely feel generic or AI-formulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Unified in tone, theme, and imagery; essential elements integrated with craft; thought-provoking and emotionally satisfying without over-explaining.</comment>
