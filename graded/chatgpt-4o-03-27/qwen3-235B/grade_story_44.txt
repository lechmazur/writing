<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zara's character is richly developed through her past, voice, and actions; her motivations are emotionally anchored, but internal conflict could deepen earlier for maximum impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is tight, coherent, and emotionally resonant within the word limit, with logical progression through each redemptive act; the riddles structure supports momentum and thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and unique—space debris, celestial junkyard, woven with concrete sensory images (e.g., comet shards, burnt sugar)—creating a richly immersive atmosphere supporting tone and character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive use of metaphor and motif (carnival, lamp, jester) supports a layered narrative on guilt and renewal; resolution is earned, though emotional payoff could be even sharper with one more beat of tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wholly original blend of science-fictional and folkloric elements; fresh metaphors and poetic language avoid clichés and exhibit distinct voice, though occasional phrasing edges toward over-stylized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>All elements serve a unified narrative vision; elegant compression of scope and theme within constraints; the story lingers, evoking wonder and reflection beyond its word count.</comment>
