<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivations are consistent and compelling, shaped by her need for purpose and her complex duality of deceptive hope; her arc is emotionally resonant but could benefit from slightly sharper interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot is structurally sound with a satisfying arc, strong causal progression, and symbolic payoff, but some transitions, particularly the shift from preparation to execution, are a touch compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The biodome setting is richly textured and atmospherically immersive; sensory details like “crimson dust” and “scent of soil and ink” deepen tone and theme expertly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A layered, emotionally resonant, and thematically cohesive story with surprising originality; just fractional polishing needed for highest-tier publication readiness.</comment>
