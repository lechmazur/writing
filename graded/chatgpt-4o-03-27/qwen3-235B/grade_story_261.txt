<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character's motivation is vividly clear and emotionally resonant, and their rigid flexibility is meaningfully embodied in their ritualistic defiance. The immortal aspect subtly enhances the sense of weariness and persistence, though a stronger 'voice' could further deepen the portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a compelling arc—beginning with a decayed world and culminating in the first real seedling. Despite a slightly abstract middle, cause and effect flow logically, and the launch is both literal and metaphorical, tying the narrative threads effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly immersive and original atmosphere; vivid sensory detail (e.g., trembling particles, ink pooling) elevates the surreal setting. The garden and concept of artificial life echo the tone and character motivation powerfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor and subtext; the story balances poetic prose with emotional weight. The final image is haunting and memorable, though a touch more clarity in pivotal transitions would deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mostly original with fresh metaphors and a unique tone, though occasional moments verge on purple prose or abstraction that slightly softens emotional immediacy. Still, inventive use of elements and no cliché reliance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, atmospheric, and emotionally charged. The structure supports a layered, symbolic narrative that provokes reflection without overly relying on exposition. Some ambiguity remains, but it enhances rather than hinders the work’s effect.</comment>
