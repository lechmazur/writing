<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex’s twitchy nervousness and necromantic skill are deeply intertwined with the narrative; his hesitation and resolve are well-motivated and consistent, though his arc edges on needing slightly more internal reflection to deepen emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly coiled with escalating stakes, a clear arc, and satisfying resolution; transitions between beats flow well, though one or two logic leaps (e.g., mural deciphering mechanics) stretch plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Bitgrave is vividly rendered with rich sensory and conceptual texture—retro elements, glitchy aesthetics, metaphysical coding all layered purposefully—producing a uniquely immersive and atmospheric world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery, thematic depth around truth and illusion, and purposeful metaphors (e.g., pixelation as destruction); ending lands with resonance, though character emotion remains more conceptual than visceral at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice feels distinct and stylized without veering into generic tropes or artificial phrasing; metaphors are specific and inventive—strong sense of authorial intent, though a few moments verge on ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; elements interlock to form a rich thematic whole, and the final image suggests ongoing narrative potential—clear evidence of deliberate, sophisticated craft.</comment>
