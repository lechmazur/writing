<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The metaphorical language is mostly fresh and fitting; some phrasing edges on overwrought, but overall it avoids cliché and feels distinctively voiced with thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story feels deliberate and polished; its brevity enhances its mystery and poignancy, and its imaginative structure allows the disparate elements to meld into a coherent, evocative whole.</comment>
