<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gravedigger is vividly shaped by his motivations and emotional ties—particularly his wife and the ritualistic duty he’s taken on—though some aspects, like his whimsy, could be more organically woven into his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and coherent within the tight word count, with clear cause and effect, but the pacing slightly tightens toward the climax, risking mild abstraction in clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive and multilayered, with strong sensory textures and a mystical tone that resonates with the character’s purpose and the narrative’s mythic undertones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Literary craft is strong—metaphorical language, thematic depth, and emotional resonance are well integrated; the climax and resolution offer poetic closure with subtextual satisfaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, though occasional poetic flourishes edge toward the overwritten; nevertheless, the metaphors are mostly fresh, and cliché is avoided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Feels like a purposeful short literary work rather than a constraint-limited vignette; all elements feel intentionally wielded, with impressive cohesion and lasting resonance.</comment>
