<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character is hauntingly well-drawn with motivations that evolve from compulsion to transcendence; emotional underpinnings are deeply embedded in action and continuity of personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc is surreal but coherent, escalating rationally from mundane repair to cosmic transcendence; climax and resolution are powerful though some connective tissue between beats is ethereal by design.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A sharply original, emotionally resonant piece that elegantly marries tone, concept, and structure; its brevity amplifies its intensity instead of restricting it.</comment>
