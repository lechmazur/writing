<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mariner exhibits a complex blend of fatalism, obsession, and transformation; his motivations are consistent with his worldview, and his voice—gravelly, mythic—is deeply distinct; however, interiority is more implied than explicitly explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story progresses logically from the mariner's discovery to his ritualistic climax, but transitions are occasionally opaque and metaphor-heavy, muting momentum; some connective tissue between exposition and climax feels overly elliptical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world-building is rich and immersive, with ultraviolet light, bioluminescent forests, and sensory-laden decay forming an otherworldly yet coherent backdrop; atmosphere and detail are exceptionally vivid and support theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is lyrical, densely symbolic, and emotionally resonant; it uses metaphor and motif with surgical precision; the ending is enigmatic but fitting, though it flirts with abstraction over clarity at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The metaphors are fresh, the prose poetic without lapsing into decorative excess; emotional resonance is strong without being overwrought, and the narrative avoids formulaic tropes, delivering a haunting, original mythos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements with elegance and purpose, achieving thematic depth and a mythic cadence within tight constraints; slight opacity in narrative flow prevents a perfect score.</comment>
