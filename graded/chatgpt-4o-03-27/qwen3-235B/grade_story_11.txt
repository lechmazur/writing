<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's emotional complexity—grief masked by eccentricity—feels authentic and driving; her motivation is consistent, though her "flighty" nature fades quickly and could be more persistently integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is compelling and complete, with clear causality from discovery to confrontation; pacing is deftly handled, though a few transitions are high-concept enough to momentarily obscure plot mechanics.</comment>
