<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer’s arc is emotionally resonant and their remorse palpable; motivation is clearly rooted in past mistakes and their actions—especially the knitting and reengagement with the microscope—show growth; the voice, while distant, is distinctive and layered with internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story forms a complete arc within the word constraint—a fall, a moment of catharsis, and a quiet resolution; some transitions between past memory and present action are slightly diffuse, and the pacing borders on languid at moments, but coherence is largely strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly evocative—greenhouse, salt air, shipwrecks—and enhances both mood and metaphor; imagery is specific and sensory, creating a surreal, liminal atmosphere that aligns with emotional transformation; worldbuilding is immersive without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g. thread, lens, storm), resonant sensory detail, and layered symbolism elevate the prose; clear emotional arc and thematic unity; the final image is poignant; one or two lines verge on overwritten, but the craft is mostly exceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Poetic and original throughout, though at times bordering on purple prose; fresh combinations of imagery (e.g. “moonlight filament,” “fingerprints like tiny galaxies”), but a few metaphors feel ornamental; emotional nuance is well-handled, though not entirely free of abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Well-balanced integration of concept, character, and world; strong emotional impact and stylistic cohesion; while a few moments drift toward vagueness, the ending is memorable, and the voice is individual and deeply felt; the narrative lingers.</comment>
