<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Julian’s characterization as a broke aristocrat is richly rendered through his mannerisms, motivations, and reactions; however, emotional interiority is slightly underdeveloped, limiting full empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively tight and coherent for the word count, with a clear beginning, rising tension, and thematic resolution; minor ambiguity in the mechanics of legacy and recipe transitions slightly hampers clarity.</comment>
