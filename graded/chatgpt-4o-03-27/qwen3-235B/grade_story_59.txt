<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The troubadour's grief drives every action with haunting clarity; his emotional arc is restrained yet potent, culminating in a powerful symbolic gesture—but his voice, though lyrical, lacks individual idiosyncrasy beyond poetic sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative offers a complete emotional arc with a strong thematic loop, but requires close reading to trace internal logic; minor obscurities in causal transitions limit full clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant—sound, silence, stars, and glass converge to create an atmosphere both spectral and intimate, enriching the character’s internal quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphor and symbolism creates deep resonance; the lyrical prose, while occasionally veering toward excess, earns its weight with emotional impact and philosophical undertone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Displays clear authorial voice, subverted tropes, and fresh metaphors; a few near-purple phrases tread the boundary of indulgence but generally maintain precision and originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels meticulously designed rather than constraint-bound, balancing lyrical density with narrative clarity; it lingers emotionally and conceptually beyond its final image.</comment>
