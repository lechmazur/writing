<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliane’s characterization is subtle but consistent—her forgetfulness, dispassionate tone, and inclination to preserve rather than consume are well integrated; however, Laurent remains underdeveloped despite his crucial narrative role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arc is elegant and complete, deftly balancing introspective tone with external stakes; the pacing is strong, and the negotiation climax feels earned, though the transition from personal wandering to public pitch strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The champagne vault is strikingly realized, its sonic and visual elements layered for sensory immersion; atmosphere and mood harmonize beautifully with theme and character, enhancing the emotional stakes of preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong voice, lyrical prose, and thematic subtext about fragility and preservation elevate the piece; the final image resonates deeply, though the dialogue’s emotional flatness slightly blunts its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An original, thoughtful concept with fresh metaphors and vivid detail—occasionally poetic to a fault, but largely avoids AI-style generic phrasing; maintains tone and emotional nuance throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive given the constraints; the story’s brevity feels intentional rather than limiting, and its emotional and thematic clarity suggest an experienced literary hand.</comment>
