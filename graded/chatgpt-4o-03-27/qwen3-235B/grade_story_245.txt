<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The smuggler’s grief, motivation, and ritualistic behavior coalesce into a deeply compelling portrait; their psychological depth and emotional contradictions are vividly conveyed without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Though largely introspective and nonlinear, the story's emotional arc is complete: a character in stasis finds fragile direction; however, a clearer outer plot movement could enhance narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The desolate spaceport and echoes of planetary decay are rendered with vivid sensory detail; atmosphere and setting reinforce grief, abandonment, and longing with precision and cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Impeccable control of tone and metaphor; the story evokes loss with jagged grace—symbolism, especially the tea leaves and chopstick, is layered yet never forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original and emotionally resonant imagery avoids AI tropes; voice is distinct, though a few metaphors verge on overwrought; overall, the language is controlled, fresh, and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A rich meditation on grief and memory wrapped in a speculative shell; minimal plot, but the internal journey is complete and resonant, with thematic cohesion and stylistic distinction.</comment>
