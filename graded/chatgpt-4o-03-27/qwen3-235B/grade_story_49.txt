<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mage is richly conceived—subtly rendered motivations align strongly with their peculiar but consistent emotional arc, especially in their nontraditional response to trauma; however, deeper interiority or more dynamic transformation would elevate the portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story effectively moves from mourning to construction through symbolic action, and the arc is complete within constraints; still, certain transitions—especially the silhouettes’ dissolution—lean abstract and thin the plot’s structural clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lunar base is viscerally and symbolically rendered, and paired effectively with fog and light imagery; concrete detail and metaphor reinforce atmosphere powerfully without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic prose carries thematic heft with compelling surrealism and ambiguity; metaphor and subtext resonate, though some flourishes verge on overworked, slightly dulling their emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery is largely fresh, character logic humanly flawed yet grounded, and metaphors nuanced—not formulaic; slight excess in lyrical styling flirts with purple prose but rarely crosses the line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant; a few moments of abstraction slightly undercut narrative immediacy, but overall the piece lingers effectively and showcases distinct creative vision.</comment>
