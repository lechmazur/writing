<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bard is richly sketched through action and symbolism; his motivations—both personal and revolutionary—are clear and consistent. His use of the dentures, and his subversive performances, reveal depth and nuance. Only slight distance from the reader keeps it from a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is structurally sound and satisfying within the word limit, building to a poignant climax and resolution. Some transitions are slightly elliptical, requiring rereading for full clarity, but overall the arc works effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is original, immersive, and powerfully atmospheric. Descriptions of the mountain bookstore and the glowing dentures create a tactile, haunting mood that fully supports the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is thematically resonant, emotionally charged, and layered with symbolism. The puppet theatre as method for dissent is elegant. Some abstract phrasing veers on the edge of over-poetic, but the storytelling remains evocative and impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and imagery, though a few flourishes—like “a blade of light from the mountain’s core”—lean toward overwrought. Minimal cliché, strong authorial voice, and emotional nuance are compelling assets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive and inventive with impressive thematic synthesis. Feels complete despite brevity, and lingers meaningfully. Minor clarity issues slightly temper an otherwise excellent execution.</comment>
