<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira is sharply drawn through her transgressive hunger and scientific conviction, with motivations that align tightly to her actions; her cybernetic enhancements deepen both her alienation and agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arc is remarkably cohesive despite the dense surrealism, progressing logically from experimentation to confrontation to resolution; however, a slightly clearer inciting moment or escalation could improve structural clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is immersive and vividly rendered—kaleidoscopic reefs, rusted motels, and biomechanical organisms coalesce into a striking atmosphere that powerfully reinforces theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and poetic without tipping into excess; the piece stimulates reflection via its ethical ambiguity, layered metaphors (reef as body, as society), and a climactic reversal that avoids cliché.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A striking and cohesive narrative that feels complete and surprising within its brevity, leaving behind a potent atmosphere and ethical resonance; minor tightening could push this into publishable perfection.</comment>
