<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is strongly rendered through symbolic action and emotional resonance; his motivation—to tame the darkness—is consistent and rooted in loss. His voice is distinctive, though slightly idealized and perhaps overly mythic at points, risking emotional distance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story arc is coherent and achieves a sense of completion within the word limit, with a clear emotional throughline. Cause and effect are generally sound, though some transitions—particularly the climax—feel slightly rushed or metaphor-overburdened.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic setting is striking and richly described with tactile and visual detail. The atmosphere powerfully mirrors Elias’s inner turmoil, creating a cohesive mood. Physical space and emotion are intertwined elegantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is evocative and lyrically crafted, with resonant symbolism throughout (e.g., metronome as heartbeat, earring as tether). The emotional arc is poignant, and the final lines echo thematically. Slight risk of overwrought language in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While some phrases verge on purple, most imagery is fresh and purposeful. The fusion of metaphor, memory, and mechanical motif feels original. Emotional nuance is handled well, with subtle implications rather than blunt declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A moving, visually rich story with strong thematic consistency. The brief length feels like a deliberate compression, adding intensity. Minor flaws in pacing and occasional lyrical excess keep it from perfection.</comment>
