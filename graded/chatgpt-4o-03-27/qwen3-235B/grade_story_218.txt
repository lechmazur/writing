<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eli's character is vivid and psychologically consistent; his transformation is believably catalyzed through internal conflict and meaningful interaction with Mara, though his voice could be slightly more distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The arc from isolation to tentative connection is clear, with strong symbolic cohesion between events; the surreal elements never overwhelm the emotional stakes, and transitions are fluid despite the compressed length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive, with the clock tower and carnival evoking eerie yet resonant metaphors for Eli’s psyche; sensory details are specific and enhance mood throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Deeply effective use of metaphor and subtext—especially the carnival as psychological space; literary devices are purposeful, the ending satisfying, and the message subtly but powerfully conveyed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on ornate, but the narrative avoids cliché and achieves freshness through its imaginative premise and surrealistic lens; emotion is conveyed through implication and image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the flash-length constraint feels like an asset, with the story delivering impact, originality, and reflection without sacrificing clarity or meaning.</comment>
