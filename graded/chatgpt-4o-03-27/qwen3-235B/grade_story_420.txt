<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sculptor is vividly drawn, with motivations grounded in creative frustration and existential uncertainty; the tension between freedom and artistic paralysis is nuanced, though the internal arc might benefit from slightly more emotional fluctuation or contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a coherent and artfully unusual arc, with clear narrative momentum from hesitation to transformation; the implosion serves as a satisfying pivot, though a small portion of the middle section edges toward abstraction over progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The desert setting is masterfully rendered with sensory richness and thematic resonance; light, sound, and geological decay all contribute to a surreal yet grounded atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the emotional terrain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical yet controlled, using symbolism (the ring, the implosion, the fossil bones) to deepen theme without overt explanation; subtle repetition and metaphor add resonance, though a tiny bit of figurative language verges on excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong stylistic voice, inventive imagery, and a deep originality in both premise and execution; although some metaphors are dense, the language largely avoids clich√© and offers moments of genuine surprise and insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive, emotionally layered, and stylistically ambitious within tight constraints; all assigned elements serve the narrative whole rather than feeling inserted, and the final line lands with lingering thematic weight.</comment>
