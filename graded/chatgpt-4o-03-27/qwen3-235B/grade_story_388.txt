<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sculptor is distinct, with her melancholy determination and artistic soul subtly but clearly revealed through choice, action, and voice; her motivation is emotionally authentic, though the warden's character lacks comparable depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story flows with clarity and cohesion, using the road trip and forest glade to structure a complete arc within word constraints; pacing and cause-effect logic are strong, though the ending resolves quickly and could benefit from more tension before the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly woven with tactile sensory detail and mythic resonance; the forest glade, sky hues, and ivy heartbeat are vivid and thematically entwined, though a few moments verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A resonant and original allegory for artistic burnout and recovery; symbolism of flora, music, and silence is layered and emotionally affecting, with poetic language serving rather than overwhelming the theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh, metaphors inventive, and emotional subtext nuanced; while slightly poetic to the point of purple in rare spots, overall style feels authorial and avoids template-based predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A memorable and elegant fable that synthesizes all assigned elements into a coherent and moving whole, with stylistic maturity and thematic depth; only slight room for polishing character dynamics and dramatic tension.</comment>
