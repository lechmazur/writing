<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motivations and beliefs are intricately woven into his actions and worldview, creating a coherent, emotionally resonant character; Lira’s subtle support enriches the dynamic, though her presence borders on symbolic rather than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-structured and thematically cyclical, culminating in a spiritually satisfying resolution tied to the falling apple; transitions between moments are occasionally abstract but still coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and evocative, with striking sensory details—the scent of blossoms, AI lullabies, rust blooming like lichen—blending hard sci-fi and mysticism masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally stirring and intellectually rich, layered with metaphor and symbolic recursion; its poetic devices are deliberate and powerful without being overwrought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and affecting, with the elements integrated into a symbolic mosaic; though dense, the story uses its brevity with literary precision to provoke questions that linger.</comment>
