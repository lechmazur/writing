<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decimus is sharply drawn with consistent motivations and an undercurrent of internal drive; his moral code and use of tech converge naturally. However, emotional depth is slightly underplayed—his voice is more intellectual than humanly vulnerable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with tight cause-and-effect progression and satisfying resolution; the rekindling of erased history offers strong narrative payoff. Slightly abrupt final transitions prevent a perfect arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly layered with inventive sensory detail—spiced tea, simulated oil lamps, glitching rain—flawlessly blending ancient Rome with cyberpunk decay. World feels immersive and integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Memorable imagery, emotional resonance, and thematic subtext ("truth as resistance") cohere. The metaphor of rain as baptism is powerful. Some metaphor layering verges on overwritten but remains effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh integration of tropes—AI Empire, bottle caps as currency, corrupted history—feels original. A few phrases risk formula, but overall ingenuity and tone subvert standard dystopian elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Creatively converges thematic depth, tight structure, and vibrant setting into a brief, cohesive narrative. Minor pacing hiccups aside, it leaves a resonant emotional and intellectual aftertaste.</comment>
