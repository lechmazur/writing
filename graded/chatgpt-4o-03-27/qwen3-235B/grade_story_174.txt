<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caelum’s motivations—rooted in regret and reverence for Elara—are profound and clearly drive the narrative; his use of fireworks and study of frost patterns feel emotionally and intellectually aligned with his persona as a theoretically creative artist, though more direct internalization or dialogue could further distinguish his voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is elegant and coherent, with a clear arc from discovery to catharsis; despite the dense prose, cause and effect are logical, and the climax resolves the core emotional tension without overstating it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and meticulously rendered through sensory detail—frost, light, mist, and stone merge to create a haunting, almost mythic mood that complements the temporal and emotional themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story delivers emotional resonance through rich symbolism and lyrical craft; the metaphors—especially the fireworks as temporal lenses—are fresh and thematically potent, though the poetic intensity occasionally borders on excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Despite abstract language and moments of florid prose, the narrative avoids formulaic tropes and demonstrates originality in concept and tone; emotional beats are largely shown with nuance, though some transitions hint at AI-like precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Every element feels in service of the narrative’s emotional core; though dense, the language sustains a mood of wonder and loss, and the story lingers with a sense of recursive beauty and earned resolution.</comment>
