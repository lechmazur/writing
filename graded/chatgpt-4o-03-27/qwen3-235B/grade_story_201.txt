<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is clear and satisfying, with a strong cause-effect chain from discovery to resolution; however, minor beats (like the shooting stars) verge on symbolic over-explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong; the story feels self-contained and artistically rendered, with its elements integrated to serve theme and mood rather than forced structure.</comment>
