<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian’s guilt is intricately woven into his actions and motivations; his forger’s background gives emotional heft to his penance-driven quest, though his voice could have been more distinctly personal to elevate the psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is impressively complete within the word limit, with strong cause-effect flow from character motivation to climactic revelation; the turbine-mechanism twist is well-seeded and pays off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The storm-swept temple with humming turbines and sensory details like ozone and old ink create a powerfully immersive atmosphere that mirrors the internal and external tension; the world feels ancient, alive, and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional resolution, symbolic use of the pen, and vivid phrasing create a story that lingers; while occasionally dense, the layered narrative and revelatory ending are both resonant and memorable.</comment>
