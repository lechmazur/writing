<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is layered and gradually revealed, culminating in a powerful internal shift; however, the professional cuddler aspect, while poetic, lacks grounding beyond metaphorical framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot structure is ambitious and emotionally resonant, with a clear arc and resolution; a few abstract transitions slightly disrupt narrative coherence within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The worldbuilding is evocative and immersive, with rich atmospheric detail and sensory layering; the spaceport hangar and lavender-scented scarf contribute powerfully to mood and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally potent and symbolically rich; the story effectively evokes reflection and emotional heft while using subtext and metaphor masterfullyâ€”though a touch more restraint might increase impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of speculative detail and intimate emotional terrain; language is poetic but nearly veers into over-ornamentation in places, though ultimately earns most of its flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cohesive, impactful, and imaginative; striking control of form and content with thematic depth, though tighter alignment of character profession to core conflict could elevate further.</comment>
