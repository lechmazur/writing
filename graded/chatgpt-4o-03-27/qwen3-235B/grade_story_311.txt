<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s arc is compelling and emotionally resonant, with clear motivation tied to his past and a believable evolution; however, the daughter’s development is slightly underexplored given her pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Well-structured within the word constraints, the story builds momentum effectively and resolves with clarity; minor contrivance in the Minister’s swift downfall slightly reduces believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered and symbolically potent; Earthlight and hydroponic life reinforce both isolation and hope, anchoring the tone and thematic resonance exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The emotional arc is subtle and mature, imagery is strong (especially the photograph and soil metaphors), and the ending lingers; some dialogue leans toward the declarative rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Conceptually fresh and emotionally grounded, with strong metaphors and no cliché reliance; however, one or two phrases veer close to over-poeticism or thematic repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive and atmospheric piece with layered meaning, elegant pacing, and a satisfying arc; minor flatness in secondary character interiority keeps it just short of elite.</comment>
