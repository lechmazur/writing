<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The duelist’s transformation from rigid precision to emotional elasticity is vividly rendered, with the internal journey organically tied to their motivations and past trauma; a slightly fuller voice or more direct emotional access could push it higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot arc—arrival, discovery, transformation, resolution—is remarkably cohesive within the tight word limit, with strong cause-effect progression and a clear emotional arc; a minor deceleration at the climax might enhance clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—evoking decay, loss, and eerie resilience through multisensory detail; the spaceport and server rooms are not just backdrop but active mood agents.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and an original concept elevate the narrative’s authenticity; occasional moments slightly verge on overly ornate but never overwhelm substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is deeply cohesive and lingers emotionally, with each element earning its place—only very slight shifts in rhythm or clarity keep it from a perfect score.</comment>
