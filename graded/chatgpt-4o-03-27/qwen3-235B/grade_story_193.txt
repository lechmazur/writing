<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The exiled prince is rendered with emotional depth and evolving motivation, his transformation tied closely to the object and setting; however, his iconic status feels slightly imposed rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is cohesive and elegantly circular—arrival, revelation, release—with strong emotional causality; minor ambiguity arises in the "sudden snowstorm" as a less integral plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is richly atmospheric—snow, ruin, dust, scent—deeply tied to the character's internal state; sensory immersion and symbolic setting superbly reinforce tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story delivers powerful emotional resonance and dense metaphorical layering; a few phrases risk overt sentimentality, but overall the prose is lyrical, purposeful, and affecting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors are mostly fresh and evocative, with minor lapses into familiar phrasing ("howled like a scorned lover"); emotional nuance is strong, avoiding typical AI flattening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A compelling, self-contained narrative that transcends its brevity through rich symbolism and elegant prose; slight thematic over-insistence in final sentence keeps it from perfection.</comment>
