<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard is vivid and emotionally resonant, with motivation and personality shaped clearly through action and memory, though some internal transitions feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a cohesive arc with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally loaded end, but minor jumps in logic—especially the Loom's reactivation—strain believability within the world’s rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The world is strikingly atmospheric, with excellent sensory details and a poetic synergy between setting and theme; only slight overdescription undermines clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Highly original and largely free of cliché; while the language is occasionally overly ornate, the vision and voice feel specific and intentional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>An ambitious, poetic piece with layered meaning and emotional resonance—high-caliber work that only needs slight tightening for top-tier publication.</comment>
