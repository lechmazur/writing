<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sir Aldric’s disciplined demeanor and underlying academic curiosity are well-integrated and believable, with his actions in the swamp reflecting both order and subversion; Mira offers strong contrast and complement, though her character lacks equal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc with satisfying resolution; the convergence moment feels earned, though the pacing is slightly dense and the scoreboard element, while symbolic, lacks narrative necessity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous swamp is vividly rendered with strong sensory imagery and symbolic resonance; the bioluminescence effectively deepens mood and complements the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story shows rather than tells, with layered metaphor and a satisfying emotional arc; the idea of legends as truth resonates, though the ending leans a touch sentimental for top-tier subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (“snail like a lighthouse”) and strong thematic weaving show originality; a few slightly ornate turns and over-neat resolutions hint at overly controlled construction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, deliberate structure supports immersive storytelling; compelling character pair and unique setting elevate the tale, although some transitions verge on tidy or expected.</comment>
