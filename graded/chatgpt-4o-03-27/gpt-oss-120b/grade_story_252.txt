<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct and emotionally textured; “penitent” and “lovingly hateful” are consistently embodied through his actions and internal conflict, though deeper insight into his past might further enrich motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and feels complete within the word limit, though transitions between mystical mechanics (petal tracking and block activation) verge on abstract and could benefit from slightly clearer internal logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegantly constructed with deliberate pacing and a satisfying thematic resolution; displays high literary ambition while maintaining emotional coherence and stylistic control.</comment>
