<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is woven consistently through the narrative and her actions—obsessive research, interpreting symbols, and following clues—support her physician-scholar traits; however, her emotional arc is underdeveloped beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc with setup, development, and resolution within the word limit; cause-and-effect progression is logical, though the climax resolves slightly too easily with a whispered name and glowing sword.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, immersive imagery imbues the world with texture—coffee-ground divination, carved glyphs, and a luminous horizon—but the “digital nomad camp” element feels underutilized amid the mystical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative evokes emotion through metaphor and atmosphere, with a theme of narrative legacy; however, it occasionally drifts toward lyricism over clarity, and stronger dialogue or tension would heighten impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Inventive metaphors and layered symbolism elevate the story’s originality, though some familiar tropes—ancient temple, glowing sword—lean on genre conventions without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Despite dense elements, the story maintains cohesion and mood with a strong thematic throughline; its lyrical tone and final image carry emotional resonance and narrative closure.</comment>
