<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character is distinct and centered—a wry, emotionally insulated caretaker whose motivations and actions align with his aloof detachment. His tone and actions are consistent, though deeper psychological nuance or conflict could elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sequence of cause and effect, from the signal’s end to the chalk ritual, is coherent and complete within the limit. However, the narrative arc remains internal and inferential, lacking some external tension for stronger structural dynamism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered—sensory details (ozone, rust, storm hums) evoke a haunting, immersive setting. The tone, space, and sensory landscape support the metaphysical mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and subtext, with a unique premise and emotionally resonant ending. Still, the conflict is subtle and introspective; deeper external stakes or interplay might enhance narrative tension and emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors are original and avoid formula. The tone is consistent, and the chalk-cloud-time mapping is conceptually fresh. A few phrases approach overwriting but largely serve the poetic cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Unusual concept executed with stylistic care and thematic focus. Elements feel integral, and the ending delivers closure and reflection. Slightly constrained emotional arc, but cohesiveness and ambition are strong.</comment>
