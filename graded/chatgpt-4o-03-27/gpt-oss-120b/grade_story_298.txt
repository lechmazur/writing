<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lian’s personality is distinct and consistent, with the rationally impulsive trait elegantly reflected in both his investigative and performative behavior; subtle emotional depth emerges through his connection to the doll’s dress and the lost poet, though more direct internal conflict would strengthen impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc—mystery, discovery, performance, resolution—within the word limit; pacing is deliberate and atmospheric, though emotional beats could land more sharply with tighter transitions between discovery and climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined with vivid sensory language—sunlight through debris, oil-drained halls—creating a surreal, decaying beauty that amplifies theme and mood; atmosphere strongly supports tone and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story evokes melancholy and wonder, using metaphor and symbolism—like the doll’s dress and sunlight—as tools for emotional resonance; subtle themes of memory and illusion are effectively interwoven but occasionally verge on poetic abstraction that may disengage some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking originality in premise and execution; avoids clichés and purple prose while employing fresh, specific imagery—though a few transitions feel slightly mannered or stylized in a way that hints at calculated rather than intuitive flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative work that integrates all elements organically; it leaves a haunting aftertaste of loss and healing—suggesting depth beyond the surface, though it could benefit from one sharper emotional climax for full catharsis.</comment>
