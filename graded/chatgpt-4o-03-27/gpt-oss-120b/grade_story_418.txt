<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arlen’s emotional arc—driven by a long-hidden love and a symbolic act of restoration—is well rendered, but Lira remains mostly symbolic and underdeveloped, which slightly weakens character depth overall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds logically to a satisfying, symbolic resolution; pacing is well managed. However, the simple premise skirts conventionality at times, lacking narrative risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative and consistent visuals—teal leaves, glitter on wind, gray dust—create a richly immersive world where atmosphere and symbolism work in tandem to elevate mood and setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant imagery and metaphor support a resonant theme of vulnerability and transformation. Some overt emotional exposition slightly dulls the impact, but subtext and symbolism remain strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While poetic and original in places, a few phrases verge on overly ornate or expected. Nonetheless, the integration of glitter and confession shows creative emotional nuance and stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally affecting; theme, tone, and setting unify well. Minor imbalances in pacing and phrasing hold it back from absolute top-tier readiness but show clear authorial intent.</comment>
