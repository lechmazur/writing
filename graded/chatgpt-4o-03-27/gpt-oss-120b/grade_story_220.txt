<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The page's aloofness and curiosity are consistently portrayed and serve the story’s momentum, but his voice and inner emotional arc remain underdeveloped — we observe him, but rarely connect deeply with him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong connective tissue between beginning and end; the narrative arc flows with clarity and resolution, though the midpoint—especially the encounter—feels slightly convenient rather than integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and expertly supports the story’s mood and themes; sensory textures (salt, rust, steel) are evocative and transportive, immersing the reader in the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered metaphors, and a unique world elevate the piece, though the emotional impact is cerebral rather than visceral—more admiration than empathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original in its metaphors and tone, with little sign of cliché or formula; however, occasional moments verge on over-stylized or poetic for their own sake rather than narrative necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Technically deft and emotionally resonant; though perhaps not flawless, it is clearly the product of sophisticated, thoughtful craftsmanship and would merit serious editorial consideration.</comment>
