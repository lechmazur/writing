<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The woodsman’s motivations are clear and emotionally resonant, with his guilt and redemption arc effectively tied to his actions; while distinct, his internal voice is subdued by the lyrical narration rather than individual dialogue or thoughts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc from inciting incident to emotional catharsis, but the method of measuring echoes feels underexplored and tacked on, weakening the story’s resolution logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The surreal atmosphere of the radio wave garden, static pulse, and resonant tower is richly immersive, effectively reinforcing mood, theme, and character; setting is an active emotional participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Evocative prose and potent imagery create emotional richness and symbolic depth, though slight overreach in metaphor density and lack of restraint occasionally dulls the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While many metaphors are fresh and the allegory feels profound, occasional overwriting, abstract logic jumps, and minor cliché phrasing betray hints of unrefined stylization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story leaves a poignant impression with strong thematic closure and artistic ambition; some uneven execution in integrating method and timeline constraints lowers immediate publishability.</comment>
