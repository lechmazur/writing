<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara is a vividly rendered character with clear motivations rooted in loss and purpose; her internal conflict between compassion and duty is compelling, though her arc could gain more nuance with a sharper emotional pivot or greater dialogue interplay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with clear progression from mission to resolution, and cause-effect is generally strong; however, the method of using machines to restore balance feels more symbolic than logically grounded, slightly softening plot plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, blending sensory details and thematic tone seamlessly; the rooftop farm feels integral to the story’s world and mood, with evocative imagery enhancing the overarching tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically ambitious, the story uses metaphor and rhythm effectively; the closing image is memorable and layered, though subtlety of subtext could be sharpened in places to enhance ambiguity and depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original phrasing and poetic imagery distinguish this from formulaic writing; occasional flirtation with overstyled prose (“softly militant,” “whispered a reluctant awe”) slightly weakens authenticity but overall voice is distinctive and consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements with admirable cohesion and emotional resonance, offering a lingering sense of loss and fragile hope; minor abstraction in logic and occasional ornamental phrasing hold it slightly back from perfection.</comment>
