<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Riven is evocative but underexplored—his voice, while glimpsed, lacks full dimensionality; motivations are implied through poetic imagery rather than concrete development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot achieves a surreal completeness, but cause-effect logic is softened by abstract symbolism; still, the progression from curse to redemption tracks well within its lyrical style.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story excels in atmospheric immersion—rich sensory detail and a surreal, mythic setting integrate beautifully with the tone and concept, creating a dreamlike world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imaginative and evocative, with strong thematic layering and lyrical prose; however, emotional resonance is dulled slightly by abstraction and lack of specific grounding in Riven’s personal stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original metaphors and tone show authorial voice, but elements like “reversed patterns” and “distant echo” teeter toward vagueness; emotional nuance sometimes yields to aesthetic flourish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Despite slight thematic obscurity, the piece feels purpose-built rather than forced; it lingers through mood and echoes rather than plot, which suits its conceptual ambition.</comment>
