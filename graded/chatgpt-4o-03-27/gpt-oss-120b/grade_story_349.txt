<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aric’s motives are clearly rooted in his desire to return home, with his "cynical hope" informing both his gesture of placing the herb bundle and his answer about mercy; however, Liora’s character feels slightly underdeveloped given her pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and emotional arc under tight constraints, with the speed dating event surprisingly integrating into the climax, though the encounter’s implausibility momentarily jars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout; sensory immersion via scent, light, and setting is vivid, and the observatory and orchard form a hauntingly cohesive environment that serves both tone and narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant writing with layered symbolism—fragrance, mercy, and rebirth—though the metaphorical density occasionally strains clarity; still, it leaves a strong impact with a lyrical close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite the challenge of integrating several disparate elements, the story achieves cohesion and emotional depth, though a few elements feel decorative rather than essential.</comment>
