<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivations are clear and emotionally grounded, but her personality feels more symbolic than fully developed; her voice is lyrical but lacks the unpredictability of a fully realized character.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A haunting, cohesive whole with memorable turns and emotional warmth; still, slight imbalances in clarity vs. poetics prevent it from feeling perfectly honed.</comment>
