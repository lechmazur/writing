<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central character is vividly imagined but remains emotionally opaque; his motivation is poetic but not deeply felt, and we don’t see enough internal struggle or progression to make him fully dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The symbolic arc is coherent and resolved, with effective cause-and-effect between the rewriting and soul gathering, but the plot remains abstract, lacking a true narrative turning point or escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is rich and immersive, with strong sensory and tonal unity; the setting powerfully supports the story’s surreal and reflective mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The craft is lyrical and emotionally resonant, with strong metaphorical layering, but the story leans heavily on symbolism without grounding tension or interaction beyond the protagonist’s internal process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The language is often original and evocative, though occasionally teeters on ornate; some metaphors verge on being excessive, and the voice, while poetic, isn't always humanly nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story binds its elements with thoughtful elegance, achieving poetic unity; however, it lacks dynamism or a human moment beyond abstraction, limiting emotional immediacy.</comment>
