<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s arc from city planner to prophetic prepper is compelling and firmly tied to his motivation; his transformation feels earned, but he lacks a strongly distinct personal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative unfolds with a clear arc and resolution; the symbolic act of rewriting destiny ties the action and method together, though some transitions strain believability slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly rendered with evocative, immersive sensory detail; the temple enhances the story’s symbolic weight and deepens the character's psychological journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly poetic and resonant with literary symbolism—especially the ink blotter and constellations—but could benefit from slightly sharper conflict or a more visceral emotional turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors and language are original and mostly effective, though verge on overly ornate at times; authenticity of emotion is nuanced but not deeply felt throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A rich, layered story with symbolic depth and cohesion, though the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction that dilutes its direct impact.</comment>
