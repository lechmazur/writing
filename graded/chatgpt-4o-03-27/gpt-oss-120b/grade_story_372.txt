<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spy's lovelorn nature is articulated through poetic reflection and metaphor, but his motivations and emotional arc remain abstract and underdeveloped; Mara's indifference adds texture but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an unconventional but coherent arc, anchored around the sticky label and the avalanche, though some cause-and-effect threads are tenuous and emotionally detached.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The futuristic slums are vividly realized with sensory-rich detail—neon water, kinetic waste, nanospice broth—immersing the reader in an atmospheric, textured world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Symbolism and metaphor are abundant, but often border on overwrought; the emotional core is hinted at rather than felt, and the central tension feels conceptually diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story shows flashes of originality, especially in its fusion of espionage, cuisine, and urban decay, but it verges on overwriting and occasionally defaults to generic poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Visually compelling and conceptually ambitious, but the narrative's emotional stakes and cohesion fall short of top-tier standards; visionary but uneven.</comment>
