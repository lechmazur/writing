<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mariner has a strong presence and consistent motivation, but his personal emotional journey feels somewhat abstract; his cold intensity is described but not deeply dramatized through action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc—with a clear setup, ascent, and resolution—but the middle leans heavily on metaphor, which slightly obscures cause-effect clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and thematic resonance elevate the piece, though some metaphoric density clouds narrative clarity; the story lingers but falters slightly on emotional intimacy.</comment>
