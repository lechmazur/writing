<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grim sentinel is evocative and consistent in tone, but lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated more than explored, with minimal internal conflict or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sense of arc with a defined beginning, middle, and end; the resolution is effective, though transitions could be more varied and causality more dynamic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ghost town at dawn is rendered with rich, immersive sensory detail, and the atmosphere of desolation and memory tightly supports the tone and theme.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original integration of sound, memory, and purpose, though at moments the language verges on overly ornamental and metaphors lean toward repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A cohesive and artistically ambitious piece with depth and imagination; slightly more emotional specificity could elevate it to a top-tier submission.</comment>
