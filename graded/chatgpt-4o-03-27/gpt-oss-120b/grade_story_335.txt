<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Riven is clearly motivated by a desire for personal redemption; his carefully reckless behavior and connection to the amber/spider metaphor deepen his persona, though some aspects feel slightly idealized or underexplored within the limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story has a strong internal structure — beginning, quest, climax, and emotional resolution are all present and well-timed; transitions are seamless and causality is logical despite the lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-turned-art-haven is vividly realized with rich sensory detail; the setting deeply enhances tone, mood, and symbolic resonance, offering both backdrop and thematic amplification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and metaphor (especially spider/amber), strong emotional resonance, and a resonant closing image — though the prose occasionally borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids tropes and clichés; shows stylistic distinction and emotional nuance, though a few similes verge on generic ("legs glinting like tiny swords") and there's slight overwriting in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and resonant for such a brief piece; the story lingers emotionally, and elements feel chosen for meaning rather than convenience.</comment>
