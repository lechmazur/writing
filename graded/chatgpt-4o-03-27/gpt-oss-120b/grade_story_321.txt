<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Corin’s internal conflict is compelling and thematically aligned, though his arc leans heavily on metaphor rather than concrete character decisions; voice is evocative but not distinct enough from the narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The action progresses coherently with a satisfying transformation, though the symbolic mechanics verge on the abstract, risking emotional distance in moments that should ground the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The infernal kitchen is vividly rendered; sensory language is immersive, enhancing tone and theme, and the imagery supports the emotional and symbolic stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and subtext enriches the emotional core; the story’s symbols echo a deeper reckoning with regret and atonement, though slightly over-reliant on lyrical abstraction in key beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Highly original and stylistically bold; metaphorical density is mostly purposeful but occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing, minimizing immediacy and risking opacity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a resonant unity of emotion, theme, and style with memorable imagery and symbolic logic, though it flirts with excess ornamentation at times.</comment>
