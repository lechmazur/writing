<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aria is vividly drawn, with her dreamer qualities and peculiar habits informing her actions and emotional arc, though Lumen is more thematic device than fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot coheres well around the mapping of memory and mourning via spices and the portal, but pacing feels dense and almost abstracted in places, with some symbolic leaps needing clearer grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive, with the portal, timeframe, and sensory language harmonizing beautifully to establish a surreal, synesthetic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is conceptually resonant and thematically layered, though some metaphoric density risks obscuring emotional clarity; the final image is poignant and satisfying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The use of spices and memory is original and avoids clich√©, but occasional overly ornate phrasing and conceptual abstraction hint at AI-like loss of narrative sharpness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A strong and cohesive piece with thematic elegance and sensory craft, though emotional distance and slight over-conceptualization hold it just below elite tier.</comment>
