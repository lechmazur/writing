<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Thalor is internally consistent, complex, and his motivation—overcoming silence-induced fear—drives his behavior in a subtle yet clear way, though more dramatic escalation might deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and paced well for the word count, though certain mechanics (e.g., the ritual meal's specific impact) could be clarified slightly to enhance coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive worldbuilding rich with sensory and symbolic detail—the frozen orchard and crevasse pulse with atmosphere that mirrors Thalor’s emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant, metaphorically layered, and stylistically strong; while minor phrases verge on overwritten, its thematic depth and subtlety are striking for the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Displays originality and emotional nuance throughout, though the use of a meal as method skirts cliché and avoids full subversion; metaphors mostly feel earned and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of elements with strong thematic cohesion and lasting impact; a few tighter lines would elevate it to elite fiction tier, but it already nears that mark.</comment>
