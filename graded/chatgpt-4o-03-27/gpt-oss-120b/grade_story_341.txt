<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s cautious nature is subtly woven into her actions, and her motivation—to map cultural patterns—is thematically coherent and reinforced through her artifacts and rituals; however, her emotional arc remains somewhat restrained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The transformation from archival mission to collective liberation is effectively structured within the word limit, with each step logically escalating; still, the final sequence resolves tension a bit too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The desert atmosphere is vividly rendered with tactile and auditory imagery (e.g., wind-singing glass, serpent skull shadows), grounding the surreal elements and enhancing tension and mystique.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story’s symbolic layering—rosary as compass, art as voice of yearning—is strong, with elegant prose and thematic cohesion; the emotional payoff is slightly muted by a lack of direct conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the story leans on familiar metaphors (desert as both constraint and freedom), it subverts cliché through specificity and originality in concept execution; minor moments verge on over-ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, layered, and ends on a resonant image; its constraint-driven narrative structure feels deliberate and enhances the overall artistry, though depth could have increased with sharper emotional stakes.</comment>
