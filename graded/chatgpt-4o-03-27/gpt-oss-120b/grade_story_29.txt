<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The knight’s motivation is clearly established and consistent, though his personality remains abstract and symbolic rather than fully realized; “cleverly naive” is told, not shown through decisions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot achieves a clear arc with setup, climax, and resolution, but some connective tissue—such as how syncing frequencies practically disables the machine—feels symbolic rather than logically grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard and its surreal elements are vividly rendered with strong sensory and metaphorical detail, enhancing both atmosphere and emotional tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story resonates emotionally, and deft use of metaphor and layered symbolism adds depth; however, some moments verge on overwrought or emotionally generalized rather than nuanced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Many metaphors are evocative, but some verge on purple prose or feel algorithmically ornate; emotional beats are clear but occasionally too explicit or uniform in tone, lacking complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and intentional, with creative use of surreal elements serving the deeper theme, though refinement in clarity and emotional subtlety would elevate it further.</comment>
