<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arc follows a dreamlike logic with a clear transition from mystery to resolution. While coherent, the plot leans heavily on symbolism over causality, which blurs its internal logic and undercuts narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined—icy mystery, greenhouse warmth, and spectral mirrors are vividly fused. Sensory and atmospheric detail is immersive and supports tone effectively.</comment>
