<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira is intriguingly developed, and her "sheepish spy" persona harmonizes with the tone and narrative arc; however, her motivations—while imaginative—lack grounding in emotional stakes, slightly muting the impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot moves with lyrical logic, and the beginning-to-end arc resolves with clarity within the word limit, though cohesion occasionally teeters on the surreal rather than structured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and tone, with fresh metaphors and inventive integration of genre tropes; only minor signs of over-convenient logic in monster behavior detract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistently imaginative and cohesive story whose emotional payoff and thematic resonance rise above mere quirk, though a touch more emotional grounding could elevate it further.</comment>
