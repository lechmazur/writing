<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character has a vivid inner life, a clear arc from delusion to self-awareness, and a distinct voice grounded in poetic introspection; motivation aligns well with actions, though the "skillfully incompetent" trait could be more demonstrably integrated into the progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story manages a symbolic arc with internal cohesion, linking memory, self-deception, and transformation; plot is more metaphysical than action-driven, and though satisfying, it veers toward the abstract at times, risking clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dense with striking metaphors and imagery, the story uses symbolism to evoke introspection and emotional complexity; the resolution is thematically rich, and the stylistic control is impressive without veering into excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels strikingly original, with fresh metaphors and unique conceptual combinations that mostly avoid cliché; only occasional moments of abstraction or overly ornate phrasing slightly dilute the human nuance.</comment>
