<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara has motivation and purpose, but her internal arc is subdued—her emotional depth and personal stakes are somewhat abstracted behind the ornate language and conceptual density.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>There’s a clear arc and an innovative method, but several transitions (e.g., signal encoding, elevator moment, fractal alignment) feel rushed or overly symbolic, sacrificing some plot clarity for atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive—soundscapes, light, motion all support the mood; the archive and rooftop are vivid metaphors, though occasionally verge on overwrought mysticism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and conceptual layering; emotionally resonant in parts, but some imagery and phrases feel overly abstract, slightly blunting the thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptual originality is strong, yet certain phrasing patterns recur, and emotional expression leans more on symbolic depiction than nuanced psychology or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and stylistically distinctive; the narrative balances idea density with aesthetic effort, though emotional immediacy is sacrificed for thematic complexity.</comment>
