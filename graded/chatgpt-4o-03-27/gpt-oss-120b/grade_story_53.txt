<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s arc from protector to cosmic dreamer is meaningful, but his rashness is underdeveloped and rarely demonstrated through action, which weakens the clarity of his core trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot has an ethereal but coherent arc, moving from discovery to transformation; however, causality between elements (e.g., postcards to telescope) feels loosely symbolic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory and atmospheric detail; the howling caverns and glowing postcards amplify the mystical tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stirring imagery and metaphor create emotional resonance and thematic richness, though the story leans heavily on poetic abstraction at the expense of tangible conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on purple prose and the emotional beats occasionally feel declarative rather than earned, but there’s clear intentionality and style with flashes of originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite a few elements feeling ornamental rather than necessary, the story is cohesive, thematically unified, and leaves a lasting impression of quiet awe and reflection.</comment>
