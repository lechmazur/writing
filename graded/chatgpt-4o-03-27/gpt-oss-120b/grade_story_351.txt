<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s personality as a dreamy, formally rebellious poet is vivid and consistently shown through her symbolic actions and lyrical connection to the station’s memory; however, internal conflict or tension is minimal, limiting deeper emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc with symbolic cause-and-effect, linking riddle-solving to physical action and emotional resolution; slight ambiguity in the logic of unlocking the compartment prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric setting is exceptionally immersive and thematically resonant—every sensory detail and image supports the story’s tone and emotional undercurrent, with ivy, light, and sound reinforcing the mood of gentle haunting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors, vivid imagery, and resonant symbolism create emotional and thematic depth; the poetic language is slightly overwrought in places, which can distract from clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates stylistic intention, though some ornate phrasing leans toward purple prose and risks feeling self-consciously literary rather than organically poetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story feels whole, deliberate, and reflective despite word constraints, with a memorable conclusion and smooth integration of symbolic and emotional layers; a few moments teeter on the edge of abstraction over clarity.</comment>
