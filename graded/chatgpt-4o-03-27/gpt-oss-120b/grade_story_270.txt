<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot maintains an ethereal coherence and completes a meaningful arc, but the cause-effect progression is more poetic than truly grounded in logic, softening the impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative displays artistic ambition and careful integration of elements, with a resonant ending; slight over-reliance on aesthetic mood over emotional grip holds it back from perfection.</comment>
