<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The conjurer is intriguing, with traits like dysfunctionally functional magic and sincere motives, but her internal arc is thinly sketched—her motivations lack specificity and evolve little across the story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative floats in a poetic dream logic that gives a sense of cohesion, but cause-and-effect relationships are ambiguous; there’s an emotional arc but minimal narrative tension or clear progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is gorgeously rendered—sea-salt, ash, and silver yarn evoke a tactile, surreal mood that aligns with theme and character, forming an immersive, dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant, with elegant metaphor and rich subtext; the prose risks veering into abstraction but largely succeeds in evoking introspection and awe, especially in the phoenix and ember motifs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels consciously ornate, and while metaphors are often fresh, a few border on the generic or overly stylized; tone remains consistent but occasionally feels AI-polished rather than human-authored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Creative and evocative with layered meaning, but lacks the tight narrative control expected of top-tier literary work—more poetic tapestry than fully resolved story arc.</comment>
