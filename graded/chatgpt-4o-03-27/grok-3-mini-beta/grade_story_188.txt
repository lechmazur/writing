<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hiroshi’s motivations are clearly rooted in his past as a lawman seeking redemption, and his actions—triggered by the letter—align with this arc; however, his emotional depth could be more sharply rendered to elevate his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the letter effectively catalyzes the plot, though some transitions feel slightly too smooth to be fully organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and symbolic use of the castle and garden; the tone and environment reinforce the protagonist’s internal journey effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses metaphor and symbolism well, particularly in the imagery of planting and decay; while emotionally resonant, it occasionally leans into abstraction at the expense of visceral impact.</comment>
