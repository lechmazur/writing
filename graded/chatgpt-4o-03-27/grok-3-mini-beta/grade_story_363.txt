<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harlan is vividly drawn, with his grief, detachment, and motivation intricately interwoven; his use of the bell and nightmares reveals depth, though his "passionate indifference" could be more dynamically dramatized in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant end; however, the pacing occasionally leans toward introspection at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>
