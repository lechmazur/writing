<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-developed character with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in grief; his vigilance and punctuality are convincingly translated from orchardist to investigator, though his emotional arc could be deepened slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a satisfying arc and logical progression, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the conspiracy resolution borders on implausible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The surreal setting is imaginative and supports the tone, but sensory detail is sparse and the atmosphere could be more immersive to fully ground the reader in this odd world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (peacockâ€™s tail, paper wings), with a memorable tone and emotional resonance; however, some moments lean toward telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise and tone, but occasional phrasing feels slightly mechanical or overly formal, and some metaphors verge on being overused or too on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Creative, cohesive, and emotionally resonant; the story integrates its elements well and leaves a lasting impression, though a few transitions feel slightly artificial.</comment>
