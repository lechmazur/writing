<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-developed with a consistent internal conflictâ€”his peaceful anger and obsession with restoration are clearly tied to his actions and worldview, though his "amiable gambler" persona could be more dynamically shown rather than told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, with the hydrolysis ritual effectively driving the plot; however, the transition from solitary ritual to communal sharing feels slightly rushed given the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The firefly breeding grounds are richly rendered with sensory detail and symbolic resonance, enhancing the mood and aligning beautifully with the themes of transformation and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (petals, hydrolysis, fireflies) creates emotional depth and thematic cohesion, though some moments verge on over-explanation rather than trusting the imagery to carry meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and poetic, with fresh metaphors and a unique tone; a few phrases lean toward ornate or abstract, but overall the voice feels intentional and human rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly integrates all elements into a cohesive, emotionally resonant narrative with a clear theme and satisfying arc; minor pacing issues and slightly abstract transitions prevent a perfect score.</comment>
