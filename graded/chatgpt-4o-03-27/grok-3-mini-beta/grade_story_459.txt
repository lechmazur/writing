<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are deeply tied to her ghost-seeing ability and her introspective nature; her actions—staking out ghost tours, dissecting the crown—are consistent and reveal emotional depth, though her voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, with the flower crown and ghostly encounter serving as effective turning points; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the ghost tour method feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sand castle lab is a striking, original setting that mirrors the theme of impermanence; sensory details and atmosphere are evocative and support the tone and character's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and symbolism, particularly the crown and sand castles; the emotional arc is subtle yet resonant, though the resolution borders on overly tidy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique setting elevate the story, though a few phrases verge on poetic excess; overall, the narrative avoids cliché and demonstrates strong authorial control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally satisfying, with all elements serving the theme of release; minor underuse of the ghost tour method slightly detracts from full integration.</comment>
