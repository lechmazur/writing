<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are layered and consistent, with her denial and mimicry deeply tied to her personality and family history; however, her emotional arc could be more viscerally rendered to elevate her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and thematically tight, with a satisfying twist, though the pacing slightly falters in the middle, and the resolution leans more cerebral than emotionally resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thematically rich, with a clear voice and emotional depth; minor clarity issues and slightly uneven pacing prevent a perfect score.</comment>
