<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivations are clearly tied to his identity as a labyrinth architect and seeker of sacred geometry; his actions—evading rivals, clinging to symbolic objects—align with this, though his emotional arc could be deepened with more direct internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, some transitions feel overly poetic, slightly obscuring cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospheric, with strong sensory and symbolic integration of the archive, radio signals, and sacred geometry; it enhances tone and character motivation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, using metaphor and symbolism well; however, the prose occasionally veers into abstraction, slightly weakening narrative immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original in concept and voice, with fresh metaphors and a unique setting; some phrasing borders on ornate, but overall avoids formulaic patterns and demonstrates strong authorial intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite the density of elements, the story feels cohesive and purposeful, with a lingering emotional and thematic impact; minor clarity issues prevent a perfect score.</comment>
