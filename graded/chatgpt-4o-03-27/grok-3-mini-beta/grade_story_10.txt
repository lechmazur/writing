<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is well-developed, with her fatal flaws and motivation clearly driving her actions; her transformation feels earned, though her emotional arc could benefit from more nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, though some transitions—especially the elixir's effects—feel slightly rushed or overly symbolic rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and thematically resonant; the decaying spaceport and server hums effectively mirror Elara’s emotional decay and reckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., larvae, elixir mutations) enriches the theme; the emotional impact is present but could be deepened with more subtlety and less exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrasing borders on ornate or mechanical, and a few metaphors feel slightly forced, but overall the story avoids clichés and shows originality in concept and execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with creative integration of elements; it leaves a lingering emotional impression, though not quite at the level of literary excellence.</comment>
