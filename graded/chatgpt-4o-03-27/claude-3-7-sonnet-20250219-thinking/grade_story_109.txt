<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aldric’s transformation is emotionally resonant and well-motivated, with his cold nature convincingly thawed by the symbolic mitten and the human stories he encounters; however, his internal voice could be more distinct to elevate the portrayal further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows a clear arc from surveillance to emotional awakening, with strong cause-effect logic and a satisfying resolution; pacing is well-managed, though the transition from agent to advocate could use slightly more tension or resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and immersive, with strong sensory detail (moonlight, wool, hush of night) enhancing the emotional tone and reinforcing the story’s themes of loss and quiet transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotionally powerful and thematically rich, the story uses symbolism (the mitten, incomplete altars) and subtext to explore grief, healing, and human connection with subtlety and craft; the ending is poignant and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in concept and execution, a few phrases verge on poetic excess, and some transitions feel slightly too smooth, hinting at formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally resonant, the story integrates its elements with purpose and leaves a lasting impression, though a touch more narrative friction would deepen its impact.</comment>
