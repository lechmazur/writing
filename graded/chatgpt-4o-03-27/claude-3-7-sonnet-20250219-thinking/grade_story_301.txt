<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hadley is vividly drawn, with consistent motivations and a compelling internal conflict between curiosity and ethics; his knitting habit and ink-stained hands subtly reinforce his duality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the pacing is deliberate, though the climax is more contemplative than dramatic, which may undercut urgency.</comment>
