<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally satisfying resolution; pacing is strong, though the climax resolves slightly too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steam-powered city is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the setting enhances the story’s tone and supports the magical realism of Gregor’s plight.</comment>
