<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Grayson's internal conflict is compelling and his ambition is clearly motivated, but his overconfidence is underdeveloped and mostly implied rather than shown through action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and builds tension effectively, but the climax feels slightly rushed and the resolution leans on ambiguity without fully earning it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and thematic resonance; the magnetic observatory enhances the surreal tone and supports the narrative's speculative core.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Well-crafted and thematically cohesive; the story lingers in the mind, though a slightly more defined resolution would elevate its impact further.</comment>
