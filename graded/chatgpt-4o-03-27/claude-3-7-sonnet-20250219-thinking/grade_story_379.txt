<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira is a compelling protagonist with layered motivations—her legal past, fugitive status, and linguistic mission all cohere; her "impatiently patient" nature is subtly but effectively dramatized through action and internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced for the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution; the action of diverting attention is logically integrated, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The biodome setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and thematic resonance; the atmosphere supports the tone and mirrors Mira’s internal state effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., gift tag, artificial dawn); the story evokes reflection on memory, identity, and resistance, though the emotional impact could be deepened slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original premise with nuanced emotional and thematic layering; avoids clichés and demonstrates a distinct voice with fresh metaphors and specific detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; all elements serve the narrative and theme, with a lingering sense of purpose and sacrifice that elevates the story beyond its surface plot.</comment>
