<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miranda is vividly rendered with layered motivations—her exhaustion, artistic struggle, and emotional repression are all consistent and compelling, though her aloofness could be more sharply defined through interaction or contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional climax and resolution; however, the pacing slightly lingers in the middle, risking a momentary stall in narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The psychedelic installation is richly evoked with sensory detail and metaphor, enhancing both mood and theme; the setting feels integral to Miranda’s transformation and emotional release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (compass, letters, murals) and lyrical prose create emotional resonance and thematic depth; the story shows rather than tells, though a touch more tension could elevate impact.</comment>
