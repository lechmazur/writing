<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s fractured psyche and emotional arc are compelling and consistent, with his motivations—though abstract—clearly tied to his actions and internal conflict; however, his mathematical challenge feels underdeveloped as a defining trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional climax and resolution; however, some transitions (e.g., from memory to action) feel slightly abrupt, and the pacing could be more fluid in places.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and symbolically resonant, with strong sensory details and a tone that enhances the protagonist’s internal state; the treehouse-library hybrid is both original and thematically apt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., thunder, basketball) creates emotional resonance and thematic depth; the story shows rather than tells, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in concept and execution, a few phrases verge on poetic excess, and the emotional nuance occasionally leans toward the explicit rather than the implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite minor flaws, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich, with a strong sense of voice and purpose; it lingers in the mind and feels like a complete, deliberate work.</comment>
