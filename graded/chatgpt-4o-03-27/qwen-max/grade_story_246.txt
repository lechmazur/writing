<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Walter is a well-drawn character with clear motivation rooted in family legacy and personal desperation; his actions align with his beliefs, though his emotional depth could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds logically, with a satisfying arc, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the resolution is more implied than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original concept with some fresh metaphors and a unique tone, though a few phrases verge on over-formal or slightly generic; mostly avoids clich√© but not entirely unpredictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive narrative with thematic depth; the story lingers in the mind, though it could benefit from a more emotionally resonant conclusion.</comment>
