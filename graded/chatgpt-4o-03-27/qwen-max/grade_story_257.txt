<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira is vividly drawn, her intellect and yearning subtly revealed through her actions and internal reflections; however, her motivation to restore lost faith could be more explicitly tied to her method of collecting postcards.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a strong thematic throughline and stylistic consistency, though some elements feel more ornamental than essential.</comment>
