<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict is well-developed, with her obsession and emotional unraveling clearly tied to her motivations and past; her reactions to the bellows and the goose deepen her character meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, though the goose subplot feels slightly under-integrated into the main action, weakening narrative propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a clear theme and stylistic control; minor abstraction in the method slightly detracts from full clarity.</comment>
