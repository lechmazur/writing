<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a satisfying resolution, with strong cause-effect logic; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the dance method feels under-integrated into the plot's momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite minor underuse of one element, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich, with a lingering sense of loss and duty.</comment>
