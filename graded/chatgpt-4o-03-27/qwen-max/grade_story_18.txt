<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s emotional arc is subtle but clear, and Orin’s role as a telepathic confidant is well-aligned with its motivation; however, Orin’s internal development is limited, and Elira’s backstory remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional climax; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the resolution, while symbolic, feels a touch too neat.</comment>
