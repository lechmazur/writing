<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-drawn with a consistent personality and motivation; his quiet defiance and nostalgia align with his "assertively meek" nature, though more internal conflict could deepen him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the gold thread moment feels under-integrated into the plot’s logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Well-crafted and thematically cohesive; the story lingers emotionally, though a few elements feel more decorative than integral.</comment>
