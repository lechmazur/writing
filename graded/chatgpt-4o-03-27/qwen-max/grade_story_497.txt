<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elric’s motivations are clear and consistent, and his actions—especially the ice etchings—align with his introspective, idealistic nature; however, his emotional arc could be deepened with more internal conflict or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution, and the satellite’s revelation ties the narrative together well; still, the pacing in the middle slightly drags with repetitive introspection.</comment>
