<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s nervousness, reluctance, and eventual resolve are well-developed and consistent; his motivation to seek meaning is clearly tied to his personality and the photograph, though his emotional arc could deepen further with more internal conflict or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc—beginning with hesitation, building toward decision, and ending with a symbolic revelation; pacing is strong, though the transition from city to stars could be more dynamically rendered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and a unique blend of science fiction and fantasy; the bioluminescent city and starry wilderness contrast effectively to support theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (stars, photograph, candle); emotional resonance is present but could be more layered; the ending is satisfying but slightly predictable in its revelation.</comment>
