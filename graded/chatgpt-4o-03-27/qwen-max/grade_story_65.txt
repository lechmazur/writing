<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bard’s personality—careless, defiant, melancholic—is well-drawn and consistent, with his motivation to escape Death and honor tradition clearly influencing his actions; however, deeper psychological nuance is limited by the brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with the picnic and music providing a satisfying climax; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the connection between Death and the sacred space could be more tightly integrated.</comment>
