<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hermit’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions align with his goal of reviving the orchard; however, his "theoretically rebellious" trait is underdeveloped and lacks meaningful tension or contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a satisfying resolution, and the pacing is well-managed; however, the action of "translation" via the weathervane is more symbolic than plot-driving, slightly weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory details and a haunting tone that enhances the story’s themes and character motivation; the comet and orchard are deeply integrated into the mood and symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly the flower album and comet; the story evokes reflection and emotional resonance, though the central conflict remains subtle and could benefit from more tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Language is mostly purposeful and avoids clichés, with fresh imagery and a consistent tone; however, some phrases verge on ornate, and the "translation" concept feels slightly abstract rather than grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with creative integration of elements and a lingering emotional impact; minor abstraction in method and character trait slightly reduce clarity and immediacy.</comment>
