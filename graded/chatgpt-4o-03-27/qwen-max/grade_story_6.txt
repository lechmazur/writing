<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The minstrel's skepticism and cautious resolve are well-established and consistent, with his motivation to outwit the trickster clearly driving his actions; however, the trickster remains more archetype than fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and strong pacing, with the meeting, conflict, and mysterious resolution all coherently tied together; the cause-effect logic is sound, though the ending leans slightly on ambiguity over clarity.</comment>
