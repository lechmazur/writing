<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and layered, with motivations tied to personal trauma and a desire for healing, but Maris’s shift from helper to agent feels underdeveloped and her motives remain too vague.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is uneven—some transitions (e.g., from forest to ossuary) feel abrupt, and the climax lacks full emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forest and ossuary are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail; the atmosphere supports the tone and themes, though the ossuary’s function strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrents and symbolic imagery (e.g., the vial, the map), but the ending, while poetic, feels slightly rushed and the dialogue occasionally veers into exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors and a unique setting elevate the piece, but a few phrases feel overly ornate or generic, and the emotional beats sometimes lack subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally resonant, with a cohesive tone and intriguing premise, but not yet at the level of polish or depth required for top-tier publication.</comment>
