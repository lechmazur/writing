<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrator has a clear motivation rooted in personal tragedy, but their personality as a "vigilant orchardist" and "never tardy" individual feels underdeveloped and disconnected from their actions; the voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot has a beginning, middle, and end, but the conspiracy arc is vague and underexplored; transitions between ideas are abrupt, and cause-effect logic is occasionally tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The setting is imaginative but underutilized; sensory details are sparse, and the atmosphere feels inconsistentâ€”oscillating between absurdity and seriousness without cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>There are hints of metaphor and theme, but the story leans heavily on exposition over dramatization; emotional beats are told rather than shown, and the ending lacks resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story feels formulaic in places, with repetitive phrasing and abrupt tonal shifts; the peacock motif is novel but poorly integrated, and the prose lacks stylistic distinction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the story attempts to weave disparate elements into a cohesive whole, the execution is uneven; creativity is evident, but the narrative lacks polish and emotional depth.</comment>
