<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character has a distinct voice and symbolic object, but his motivations—while stated—lack emotional depth and complexity; his dishonesty is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a circular structure and thematic cohesion, but lacks a clear arc or tension; the action unfolds more as a meditation than a narrative with stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard amphitheater is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail; the setting enhances the surreal tone and supports the character’s introspection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and symbolic, with some effective metaphors, but the emotional impact is muted and the conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and setting, but the language occasionally veers into vague abstraction and lacks the specificity or surprise of truly fresh storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, but its philosophical musings feel more like a sketch than a fully realized narrative; it lingers, but doesn’t haunt.</comment>
