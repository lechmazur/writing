<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The performer's emotional arc is present but underdeveloped; her motivations are hinted at rather than deeply explored, and her transformation feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot progression is overly internal and lacks dynamic tension; the action of "organizing thoughts" is abstract and repetitive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory details, but the juxtaposition of lake and construction feels more aesthetic than narratively integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story uses metaphor and symbolism effectively, but emotional impact is dulled by repetition and a lack of narrative specificity; the ending is serene but predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the prose avoids clich√©s, it leans toward purple at times and lacks the unpredictability or nuance of truly original work; metaphors are occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but its emotional and narrative stakes remain too subdued to leave a lasting impression; it feels more like a sketch than a story.</comment>
