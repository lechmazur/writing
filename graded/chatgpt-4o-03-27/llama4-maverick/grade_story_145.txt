<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The character has a compelling backstory and symbolic object, but their emotional arc lacks depth and specificity; motivation is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes feel overly smooth and lack tension; the echo test is underutilized as a dramatic device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with strong sensory detail and mood; the setting enhances the tone and supports the characterâ€™s journey effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, but emotional impact is dulled by abstract phrasing and lack of concrete stakes; ending is poetic but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and thematic ambition, but lapses into vague, ornamental language and familiar tropes; lacks the stylistic precision of top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story is cohesive and thematically unified, but leans on atmosphere over narrative tension; creative, but not yet at a publishable standard for elite journals.</comment>
