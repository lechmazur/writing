<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character's motivation is consistent and clear, but the somnambulist trait is underutilized and never meaningfully impacts behavior or perception; voice is serviceable but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes are overly smooth and lack tension; the plot progression feels linear and safe, with minimal conflict or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and immersive, with strong sensory detail and a consistent tone; the setting enhances the mystery, though the sunken laboratory feels more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>There is emotional resonance and thematic depth, but the story leans heavily on exposition and telling rather than showing; the ending is satisfying but predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and ideas, but the prose occasionally lapses into generic phrasing and formulaic transitions; the originality of the premise is dulled by execution that feels AI-generated at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtful, but lacks the narrative risk or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary level; it feels polished but not transcendent.</comment>
