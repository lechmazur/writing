<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct voice and introspective tone, but their identity as a "perceptive cartographer" is underutilized in shaping their actions or decisions; motivation is clear but not deeply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from hospital to forge feels metaphorical rather than literal, weakening narrative coherence and cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory detail, but the futuristic hospital setting is underdeveloped and could be swapped with a generic sterile space without much loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors and a consistent tone, but moments of overwrought phrasing and vague transitions suggest formulaic tendencies and lack of narrative specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically ambitious, but its abstract execution and underutilized elements prevent it from achieving top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
