<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The conjurer's personality is sketched with poetic flair, but their motivation—while thematically resonant—lacks concrete development through action or change; the character remains static, more symbol than person.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the language is often elegant, it occasionally veers into overwrought abstraction; originality is present in tone and setting, but the emotional beats feel more stated than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically unified, with a lingering emotional tone, but its impact is dulled by a lack of narrative momentum and character evolution.</comment>
