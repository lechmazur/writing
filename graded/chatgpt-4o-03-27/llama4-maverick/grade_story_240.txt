<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The soothsayer's motivation is stated but not deeply explored; their pragmatism is implied through action but lacks emotional nuance or internal conflict to fully humanize them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the progression feels overly linear and symbolic rather than grounded in cause-effect logic; some transitions are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and immersive, with strong sensory detail and a consistent tone that enhances the mystical mood and supports the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism, but emotional impact is dulled by abstract language and lack of character depth; the ending is evocative but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and setting, but the prose occasionally veers into purple territory and relies on familiar mystical tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, but lacks the emotional complexity and narrative surprise expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
