<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The character has a distinct personality and motivation, but their emotional depth and transformation remain surface-level; the "optimistically bitter" tone is stated more than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot progression is repetitive and lacks dynamic escalation; the mystery elements are intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but the phrasing is often formulaic and transitions feel mechanical; lacks the nuance and unpredictability of human storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>All elements are present and mostly cohesive, but the story feels constructed around prompts rather than organically developed; lacks the polish and depth of top-tier fiction.</comment>
