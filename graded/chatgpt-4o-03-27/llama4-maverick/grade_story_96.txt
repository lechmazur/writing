<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator has a distinct voice and some internal motivation, but their emotional arc lacks depth and specificity; the "underground poet" identity is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a loose arc and thematic cohesion, but the plot progression is minimal and leans heavily on mood rather than action or transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric with strong sensory detail; the witchâ€™s menagerie is evocative and supports the tone and theme well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on purple prose; the tone occasionally slips into abstraction, and the emotional nuance feels generalized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, but its impact is muted by a lack of narrative tension and overreliance on poetic language.</comment>
