<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is stated but not deeply explored; their "suspiciously trusting" trait is mentioned but not meaningfully dramatized or tested through action or interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot progression feels overly linear and lacks tension or complication; the action of tracing the wick is underdeveloped as a driver of narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues, but the "labyrinth of broken mirrors" is more aesthetic than functional to the plot or character development.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>There is some symbolic layering and thematic intent, but the prose leans toward telling rather than showing, and emotional stakes remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Several phrases feel formulaic or generic, and the tone shifts inconsistently; the story lacks the stylistic distinctiveness or surprise needed for top-tier originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story is coherent and mildly engaging, but it lacks the depth, tension, and stylistic polish required for elite publication; the elements feel more assembled than organically integrated.</comment>
