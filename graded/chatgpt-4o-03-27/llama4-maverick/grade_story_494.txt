<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The swordsman's internal conflict is hinted at but not deeply explored; his transformation feels more symbolic than psychologically grounded, and the calligraphy master remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is overly languid and the action of "authorizing" feels metaphorical rather than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its impact is dulled by a lack of narrative risk and overly safe emotional beats.</comment>
