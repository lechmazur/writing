<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but the prose occasionally veers into vague or formulaic phrasing, and the metaphors lack freshness or specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but it feels more like a lyrical vignette than a fully realized narrative; stronger conflict or character nuance would elevate it.</comment>
