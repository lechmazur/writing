<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The smuggler's motivation is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond surface traits; "logically emotional" is not convincingly demonstrated through action or thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing is overly even, with little escalation or tension; the countdown feels decorative rather than integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with strong sensory detail, especially scent and sound; the setting enhances mood, though the "whispering gallery" is underutilized conceptually.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some strong imagery and symbolism (e.g., the key), but emotional impact is muted; lacks subtext or a compelling central conflict to elevate the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Language is occasionally ornate without purpose; some phrasing feels generic or AI-patterned; lacks stylistic distinctiveness or surprising insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story is cohesive and competent, but plays it safe; elements are integrated smoothly but without much ingenuity or lasting resonance.</comment>
