<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hermit's motivation is clear and consistent, and their emotional arc is subtly conveyed, but the character lacks deeper complexity or contradiction that would elevate them beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and some transitions (e.g., elevator arrival) feel more symbolic than narratively integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and atmosphere, with a resonant theme, but emotional beats are occasionally overstated and lack subtlety in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on cliché and the prose occasionally leans into generic phrasing; while the story avoids formula, it doesn’t fully transcend familiar post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a clear emotional throughline, but lacks the narrative risk or stylistic boldness expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
