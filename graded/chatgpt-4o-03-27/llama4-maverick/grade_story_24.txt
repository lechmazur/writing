<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bard has a distinct voice and consistent motivation, but emotional depth and complexity are underdeveloped; reactions to the dentures are symbolic but lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes (bookstore to bar) feel abrupt and underexplored; cause-effect logic is serviceable but not seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric with strong sensory detail; the mountain bookstore is evocative and supports tone and theme well, though the connection to the puppet shows is tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (dentures as resistance), but emotional resonance is more told than shown; lacks a central conflict with stakes or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and imagery, but moments of generic phrasing and slightly mechanical transitions suggest formulaic tendencies; lacks surprising insight or subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Creative premise and cohesive tone, but the story leans on poetic abstraction over narrative clarity; memorable but not fully satisfying in execution or depth.</comment>
