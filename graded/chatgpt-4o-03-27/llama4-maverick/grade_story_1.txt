<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The character's phobia and thrill-seeking nature are introduced but not deeply explored; motivations are stated rather than shown, and the stunt double identity feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but transitions between scenes (garage sales to pyramid) feel abrupt and underdeveloped, weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but several elements feel formulaic or disconnected; language occasionally veers into vague abstraction or generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and attempts depth, but lacks the polish, nuance, and integration of elements expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
