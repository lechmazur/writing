<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jack's transformation is conceptually interesting, but his motivations and emotional arc feel underdeveloped and overly reliant on abstract language rather than concrete actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a beginning, middle, and end, but the plot progression is vague and driven more by mood than clear cause-effect logic; the transformation feels more told than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse engine room is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues, though its connection to the dummy and transformation theme could be more integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The poetic language and metaphorical layering are ambitious, but the emotional impact is dulled by abstraction and lack of grounded tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but the execution leans on familiar tropes (haunted object, sudden artistic awakening) and occasionally lapses into vague or overwritten phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the narrative precision and emotional depth required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
