<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Several phrases verge on purple prose, and the repetition of motifs like "harmony in chaos" and "shared secret" feels mechanical rather than organic or surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, but lacks the narrative urgency, originality, or emotional resonance required for top-tier publication.</comment>
