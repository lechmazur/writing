<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Jack’s motivations are intriguing and layered, but his emotional arc feels underdeveloped; his shift from solitary schemer to open collaborator with Sophia lacks sufficient internal conflict or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and logical progression, but the climax and resolution feel rushed; the throne plot is introduced late and resolved too easily, undermining narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and original, with strong sensory cues and atmosphere; however, the labyrinth orchard’s role in the plot is more aesthetic than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story has thematic ambition and some elegant prose, but lacks emotional depth and subtext; the partnership feels too convenient, and the tone flattens the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in setting and premise, but several elements (e.g., throne, pottery class) feel like stitched-together prompts rather than organic parts of a cohesive narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is competent and imaginative, but doesn’t fully transcend its constraints; it hints at depth without fully delivering on character complexity or thematic resonance.</comment>
