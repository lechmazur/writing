<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story has a beginning, middle, and end, but the logic of the pantomime silencing the crowd strains believability; cause and effect feel symbolic rather than grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>There is strong symbolic imagery and a unique premise, but emotional resonance is muted and the conflict lacks urgency; the ending is poetic but not deeply affecting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Several phrases feel ornamental or generic; the prose leans toward purple, and the metaphors lack freshness; originality is present in concept but not in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and conceptually intriguing, but the execution is uneven, with style and tone occasionally clashing; it leaves a faint impression rather than a lasting one.</comment>
