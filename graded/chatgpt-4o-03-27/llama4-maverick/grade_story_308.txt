<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The executioner’s bashfulness and transformation are hinted at but not deeply explored; his motivation to preserve dance is present but underdeveloped emotionally and psychologically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the plot progression is more atmospheric than driven by strong cause-effect momentum; some transitions feel overly smooth or vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but the language occasionally slips into generic phrasing and lacks the stylistic precision or surprise expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but doesn’t fully capitalize on its unique elements or deliver a lasting emotional or intellectual impact.</comment>
