<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's emotional arc is clear and her motivation to sever toxic ties is consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond poetic introspection, and her voice feels generalized rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, but the plot progression is more emotional than event-driven, and some transitions feel overly abstract or repetitive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sensory atmosphere is rich and immersive, especially in the stadium and valley contrasts, though the yodeling valley feels more symbolic than grounded in reality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but others verge on overwritten or vague; the tone is consistent, yet the writing occasionally leans into poetic abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its emotional impact is muted by a lack of narrative surprise or complexity in character dynamics.</comment>
