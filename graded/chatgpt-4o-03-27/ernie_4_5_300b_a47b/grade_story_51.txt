<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus is richly drawn, and his internal conflict is deeply tied to his past and his symbolic object; however, Elara, while effective in her role, lacks comparable depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with a coherent arc, and the "accidental" meeting is well-executed; a slightly neater resolution or surprise might elevate it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and thematically resonant, with strong sensory detail; the static garden powerfully mirrors Marcus’s inner state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows genuine stylistic choices and metaphor; a few transitions verge on overly controlled structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Deeply cohesive with layered meaning; the brief length serves the story's intent, though minor dialogue refinement could further polish the piece.</comment>
