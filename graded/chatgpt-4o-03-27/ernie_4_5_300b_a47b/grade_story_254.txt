<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlowe is vividly drawn with a distinctive voice and internal logic; his scowl, bitterness, and association with failure inform every gesture, especially in his relationship to the inkwell and his dead father.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a consistent arc within its constraints, balancing surreal motivations with emotional realism; the “concession” unfolds convincingly through internal conflict and conclusion rather than external resolution.</comment>
