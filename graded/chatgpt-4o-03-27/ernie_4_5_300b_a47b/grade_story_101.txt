<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Characters are emotionally resonant, with Eleanor’s manic clarity and Marcus’s reluctant transformation both clearly shaped by their motivations; however, Marcus’s internal struggle could be more distinct in dialogue and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc from creative stagnation through external disruption to conceptual rebirth is coherent and satisfying; the 'parade detour' device is slightly contrived, but the progression feels earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and symbolic, with evocative sensory detail and atmosphere that reinforce the emotional and thematic stakes; the interplay of studio and parade enhances contrast effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional throughline, layered symbolism, and literate, textured prose underpin a meditative theme; dialogue occasionally verges on overly didactic, slightly weakening subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Impressive originality, though at moments the phrasing leans toward poetic excess; metaphors are mostly fresh, especially the bee motif, but the tone flirts with artifice at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Overall, a moving and artfully constructed story that weaves its conceptual elements into a unified whole with real emotional resonance and literary ambition.</comment>
