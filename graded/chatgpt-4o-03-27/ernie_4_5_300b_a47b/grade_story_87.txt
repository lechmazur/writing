<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eleanor is richly characterized through action, internal conflict, and layered emotion; her transformation is believable and deeply tied to her motivation, though a touch more dialogue or memory detail from Marcus might enhance her emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows a satisfying emotional arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end, all within the word count, though the pacing of the transition from anger to closure verges on too tidy given the depth of past wounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The steampunk setting is intricately entwined with the emotional tone; sensory details (humming gears, ticking clocks, creaking pipes) enhance mood and themes of memory, time, and reclamation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The writing is rich in metaphor and symbolism, particularly through the tapes and stickers; the emotional resonance is potent and the theme of forgiveness is handled with elegance and restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and metaphors are fresh; emotion is shown through actions and setting, not told. Minor hints of ornate phrasing nearly cross into florid territory, but remain under control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and originality; the story feels whole and impactful within its brief length, though the resolution may feel slightly too polished for some literary tastes.</comment>
