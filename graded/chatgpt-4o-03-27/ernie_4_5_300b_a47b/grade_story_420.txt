<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is well-realized: his motivations are clear, emotionally resonant, and evolve meaningfully through the artifact and setting—though some emotional beats near the climax feel more symbolic than grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story has an elegant arc within the constraint, a satisfying resolution, and strong internal logic; only minor ambiguity in the ring-to-thread transformation slightly muddies coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>This is a polished, resonant piece with a unique, metaphor-driven narrative that feels complete and intentionally wrought—top-tier quality with only minor rough edges.</comment>
