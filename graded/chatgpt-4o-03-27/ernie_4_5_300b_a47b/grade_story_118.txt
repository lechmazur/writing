<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>V-7’s psychological depth is conveyed effectively through interaction with the hive-mind and the ritual of wax coding; her motivation to "anchor the ephemeral" emerges subtly yet coherently. Still, character growth is implied more than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story forms a full arc with a clear buildup and resolution within the word limit; actions build logically toward the climactic infiltration at dawn, though plot mechanics (e.g., the map's function) remain ethereal and could be more grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly layered with sensory detail and thematic resonance between setting and tone—copper and lemon air, cicada-chorus voices, and the facility’s regret-laced vents deepen immersion masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sharp metaphors (e.g., plug as fear), layered symbolism (wax, hindsight), and tonal control elevate the narrative; still, the emotional journey feels slightly underdeveloped beneath the stylistic bravura.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original blend of voice, metaphor, and conceptual twist; never formulaic, with fresh, specific imagery like wax forming codes and hindsight as sound. Unique enough to feel human-driven, not generative or trope-reliant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Smart, moody, and cohesive; each element feels purposeful rather than imposed. Leaves a resonant idea behind, though emotional payoff could deepen with slightly more character grounding.</comment>
