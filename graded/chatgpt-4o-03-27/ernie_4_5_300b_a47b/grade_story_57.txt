<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Everard is sharply drawn with consistent traits—his meekness, empathy, self-effacing humor, and quiet resolve are compelling and evolve authentically through his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot arc is well-contained within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the resolution feels slightly rushed, stretching plausibility in the final transformation scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Genuinely fresh voice; original premise and emotional texture avoid cliché; metaphors are clever and specific—a rare stylistic confidence in flash fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite numerous constraints, the story feels cohesive and organic; the elements support rather than constrain it, and the lingering tone of quiet rebellion is memorable.</comment>
