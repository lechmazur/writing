<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias is distinct and psychologically coherent; his obsession with excavating time through art and memory aligns with his identity as a dismayed minstrel. His subjectively rational mindset and poetic despair create a compelling internal logic, though emotional nuance beyond loss could be deepened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying sense of arc and resolution, with strong thematic coherence.
