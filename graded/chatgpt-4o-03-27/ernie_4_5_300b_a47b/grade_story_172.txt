<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrator’s role as an “unsettled guide” is intriguing, but their voice lacks emotional specificity; motivations feel told rather than shown, and their transformation is more functional than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc within the constraint, with strong cause-effect progression, but some transitions feel rushed and resolution is more symbolic than narratively earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and thought-provoking, with poetic overtones and thematic richness—a compelling piece that lingers despite some uneven execution in character depth and pacing.</comment>
