<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Alaric’s obsession and hunger for forbidden power are clear, and his actions align with his motivations, but his voice and interiority remain somewhat underdeveloped, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and progression; the mine’s descent and climax work well structurally, though transitions between the discovery and the ritual feel slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric, with evocative sensory details and a tone that supports the supernatural tension; the abandoned mine and ancient library blend well into the mythic narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Memorable imagery and an eerie tone provide impact, but the story leans heavily on exposition over subtext, and the emotional payoff of Alaric’s transformation is more intellectual than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept avoids clichés and offers genuine originality in combining obscure elements, though some language choices skirt purple prose, and the final transformation lacks emotional sharpness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Well-constructed and thematically coherent, the story’s ambition shows, but deeper emotional resonance and sharper characterization would elevate it to top-tier literary status.</comment>
