<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thaddeus is a richly drawn character whose archaic demeanor, existential dread, and subtle warmth (as shown through the fox) all cohere; his aimless wandering is consistent and meaningfully challenged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is subtle but complete, with a strong beginning and an internal resolution; however, the mirror sequence borders on the esoteric and may alienate some readers seeking clearer causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and thematically resonantâ€”frost and glass mirroring inner states; sensory detail is immersive and tone-appropriate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant prose, layered symbolism, and emotional resonance elevate the narrative; the final image haunts, and the theme of surrendering control is well-authored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh, emotions are shown through action and detail, and the narrative avoids formulaic beats; the use of mirrors and the fox kit feels deeply human and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements almost seamlessly, with creative interpretation and emotional depth; only minor opacity in the mirror logic detracts from full clarity.</comment>
