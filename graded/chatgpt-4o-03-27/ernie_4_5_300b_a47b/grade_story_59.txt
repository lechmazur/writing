<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The troubadour is emotionally rich, with motivations and responses that feel consistent and deeply human; his predictable self-destruction and final release are aligned with his melancholy arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative is tightly controlled with a clear arc, from the troubadour's entry to his catharsis; the surreal echo chamber as method and setting anchors the plot effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is often poetic but mostly avoids excess; metaphors are fresh, character reactions nuanced, and voice distinctive—though occasional phrasing flirts with cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion, emotional depth, and lyrical style make it nearly publishable at a high tier despite minor overindulgence in prose; a haunting, layered narrative.</comment>
