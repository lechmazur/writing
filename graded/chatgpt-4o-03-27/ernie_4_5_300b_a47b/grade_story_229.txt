<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias and Mara feel authentic; Elias’s obsession is well motivated by his philosophical curiosity and promise, and Mara’s skepticism frames the emotional arc effectively. Still, Mara remains more reactive than fully fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within a tight word count, progressing logically from setup to emotional climax. A few moments stretch believability slightly, but pacing and structure are strong overall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is superbly rendered—moody, textured, and immersive. The graveyard setting, sensory details, and thematic resonance of decay and memory are all strikingly handled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and subtext, with a clear emotional throughline and thematic depth. Dialogue is sometimes a bit stylized but effectively contributes to tone and character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and evocative, though certain phrases verge on overly poetic or abstract. The language largely avoids cliché and shows authorial voice and intention, with some truly fresh conceits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and emotionally resonant, the story leaves an aftertaste of curiosity and wonder. Slightly more grounding in method detail would perfect the balance between poetic and precise.</comment>
