<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with clear motivation and internal conflict, his "elegantly clumsy" nature nicely underlining his emotional fragility; however, some of his behaviors, like stalking ghost tours, verge on the underdeveloped or unexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and emotional resolution, with a satisfying ending; however, the ghost-tour method feels vaguely sketched and lacks narrative payoff, slightly weakening the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is beautifully eerie, and the sandcastle lab is richly metaphorical and sensory; sensory details like "cold air smelled of salt and regret" are effective and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative prose, strong metaphors, and emotional depth give this story power; the theme of impermanence is subtly handled, though a few lines lean toward abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Highly original concept and strong atmosphere, but some elements (e.g., ghost-tour staking) feel grafted on rather than organic, and occasional phrasing risks veering into stylized vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Creative, emotionally resonant, and memorable; while a few assigned elements strain integration, the narrative feels whole, and the aesthetic is distinct and purposeful.</comment>
