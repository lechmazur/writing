<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael’s arrogance is well-rendered, and his emotional arc from pride to vulnerability is convincing; the shift feels earned and his motivation—rekindling family legacy—is clearly expressed in both action and dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and satisfying within the word constraint; Kael’s journey from confrontation to transformation is well-paced, with clear cause-and-effect throughout, though the 'authorizing via song' resolution risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and symbolic—cherry blossoms, mist, and calligraphy enrich mood and deepen the theme; sensory detail is restrained but powerful, enhancing atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elegantly written, with evocative metaphor, emotional resonance, and thematic cohesion; the use of song as emotional unlocking is symbolically rich, and the ending is poetic without being sentimental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Some phrasing flirts with overpoeticism, but overall the voice is fresh, emotionally nuanced, and avoids clichés; symbolism feels organic, though "ignite a flame no storm could douse" edges toward the familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Each element supports the whole; the story resonates emotionally and thematically, delivering layered meaning and a satisfying transformation in a compact form that feels intentional rather than constrained.</comment>
