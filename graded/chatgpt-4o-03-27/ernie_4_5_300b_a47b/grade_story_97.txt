<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael is well-developed, with a clear arc from fact-minded skepticism to empathic realization; her transformation feels earned, though Kael remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc with strong cause-and-effect logic, though some transitions (especially the dimensional tear) feel abrupt and slightly under-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and rich imagery turn the unstable dimension into a thematically resonant space; the world supports both mood and character journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Impactful use of metaphor and poetic language enhances emotional resonance; however, a slightly over-reliance on abstraction dilutes the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally fresh and thoughtfully written, though moments verge on poetic excess or slightly generic phrasing typical of AI outputs ("the cradle of a whispered minute").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Creatively integrates disparate elements with emotional weight and thematic cohesion, though not flawlessâ€”some polish needed in pacing and depth of secondary character.</comment>
