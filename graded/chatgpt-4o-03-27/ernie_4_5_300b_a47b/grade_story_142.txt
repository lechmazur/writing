<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Algernon's arc is coherent and emotionally resonant—his pride, burden, and transformation are well expressed, though his 'voice' lacks moments of deeper interiority that would elevate the portrayal further.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot moves cleanly from burden to revelation to resolution with clear symbolic and emotional beats; some transitions feel slightly metaphor-driven rather than action-driven but overall are effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The haunted park is vividly realized through sensory detail and metaphor; the roller coaster’s decay and ghostly ambiance reflect Algernon’s internal state with impressive precision and atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (orchid, blueprint, ghosts) and a rich emotional undercurrent give the story depth; the final transformation is earned, though some lines lean into slightly overwritten metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché and employs deft metaphor and theme weaving, though some phrasing edges toward ornate; the originality is strong but not groundbreaking in concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Excellent cohesion across theme, tone, and structure; the execution feels intentional and polished, with symbolic threads tied neatly to character and setting.</comment>
