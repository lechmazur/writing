<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s restlessness, memory of Veyra, and emotional arc are well-drawn and thematically consistent, though dialogue is sparse and internal voice could be more sharply individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Compact yet cyclical arc with an effective pivot after the roadblock; pacing and cause-effect logic are smooth, though the resolution borders on sentimental over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive with vivid sensory details; the cave, algae, and lake all reinforce theme and character, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism is strong and the prose lyrical, but occasional near-cliché phrases and a slightly flattened final emotional beat hold it back from profound resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, elegant subversions, and a lack of formulaic structure make it feel genuinely authored; minor instances of ornamental phrasing limit perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Unified, evocative, and thematically resonant; strong emotional coherence and high literary merit, though just shy of transcendent impact due to slight tonal overcontrol at the end.</comment>
