<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivations are clearly linked to his trauma and grief, and his actions—particularly the planting of the chopstick—reveal emotional depth; his voice, while not in first-person, is distinctively sardonic and wounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound, with a clear emotional progression and resolution; however, some transitions—like the leap from waterfall quest to fungus valley—feel slightly abrupt under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The spaceport is richly textured with vivid detail; atmospheric degradation mirrors Kael’s emotional decay, and sensory descriptions contribute powerfully to tone and immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant, symbolically rich, and layered with metaphor; the heartfelt final image elevates the piece’s thematic weight, though some metaphors veer toward overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery is often fresh and specific, with few clichés; while some phrasing flirts with purple prose, the emotional authenticity and thematic ingenuity outweigh formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece is cohesive, stylistically deliberate, and thematically ambitious; all elements feel in service of the whole, especially in how grief, memory, and place are intertwined.</comment>
