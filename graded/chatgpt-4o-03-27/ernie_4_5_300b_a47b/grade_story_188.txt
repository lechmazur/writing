<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Haru is distinctly rendered, with motivations rooted in guilt and trauma; his actions—planting, investigating, ultimately destroying the mural—align with his emotional arc, though Yumi's role could be slightly more dimensional to strengthen conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure moves cleanly from discovery to confrontation to resolution, with solid cause-effect logic; the pacing is controlled and purposeful, though the mural destruction teeters on symbolic overstatement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The castle and its decay are richly textured, mirroring Haru’s internal corrosion; sensory details (cold stones, whispering lichen) heighten the mood and underscore the tension between life (garden) and death (castle).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves subtextual depth through metaphor (spectacles, seeds), and the theme of atonement lands with emotional resonance; the ending is quiet but affecting, though some phrasing borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on purple (“corroded rapture,” “skeletal fingers”) but overall, the writing resists cliché with vivid specificity and a coherent, original tone; the structure is clearly deliberate, reflecting thematic intent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All core elements feel intricately interwoven, and the story leaves a lingering mood and thematic impression; its brevity feels deliberate rather than constrained, though some moments are slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
