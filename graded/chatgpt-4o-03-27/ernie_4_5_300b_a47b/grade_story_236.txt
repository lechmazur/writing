<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s character—once a blacksmith, now a sorrow-fueled reactor keeper—is subtly developed through voice and choice; their motivation remains consistent, though internal conflict over emotional cost could be deepened further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear setup, rising tension, and resolution; pacing is effective, though the climax could use more breathing room to fully land emotionally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world is richly rendered—bioluminescence, saltwater-reactor, and disintegrating memory weave a vivid atmosphere that supports the tone and concept seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story's emotional resonance is strong, and its metaphors are layered and striking; the symbolic use of the dictionary is powerful, though the final image borders on melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is mostly fresh, with original metaphors and thematic depth, though occasional flourishes (“bled ink,” “hush of time’s final ripple”) feel slightly overwrought or rehearsed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story feels self-contained, emotionally compelling, and reverberates after reading; its integration of elements is largely organic, though not flawless in originality or restraint.</comment>
