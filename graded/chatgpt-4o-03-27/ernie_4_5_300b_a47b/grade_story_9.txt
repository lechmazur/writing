<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara’s characterization is vivid and consistent—the soothsayer’s voice, motivations, and symbolic actions tightly align with her role; her tone and internal logic feel authentic. Minor weakness: emotional depth could be deepened beyond stylized cynicism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>There's narrative momentum and a clear arc despite surrealism; opening and resolution are satisfying. However, some transitions (e.g., water rings to aquifer revelation) feel a touch abrupt or too metaphorically convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is rich and immersive—sensory details and atmosphere bleed into the action. Neon-lit wasteland and billboard dystopia feel fresh and symbolically potent. World and mood are seamlessly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking use of symbolism, sarcasm, and surreal imagery enriches theme and mood. The story evokes thought and dark humor. Slightly overindulgent in metaphor at times, but ending lands powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mostly original voice and vivid imagery. While some metaphors flirt with purple prose, most are inventive and contextually relevant. A few phrases lean into stylistic excess but not fatally so.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive, well-written, and thought-provoking with strong stylistic vision. Slight surreal leaps prevent it from being flawless, but overall it feels deliberate, layered, and impactful.</comment>
