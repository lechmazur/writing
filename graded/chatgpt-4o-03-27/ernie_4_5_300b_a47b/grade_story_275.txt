<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elia's motivations are clearly aligned with her theoretically rebellious nature—defying the comet’s curse through quiet defiance. Her actions are consistent and emotionally grounded, though her “distinct voice” as a character is more implied by narration than built through dialogue or internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc with a distinct beginning, middle, and resolution. The seed discovery and planting provide an effective climax. Cause and effect are handled well, though some transitions feel slightly too smooth to be fully organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly textured—frost, comet light, creaking machinery, and scorched land combine into a haunting setting. The orchard and sky mirror Elia's internal world effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative prose, strong metaphors, and an original concept deliver emotional resonance. The theme of translation-as-life feels poetic and earned. Some symbolic elements (weathervane shift) could risk overstatement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stylistically elegant and mostly avoids clichés. Certain phrases verge on melodrama or overuse (“language waiting to be translated”), but fresh metaphors and a consistent tone elevate it above formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Creative, emotionally resonant, and cohesive in both structure and theme. The story lingers with symbolic power and feels intentional, though minor moments feel more “fitted” than organic.</comment>
