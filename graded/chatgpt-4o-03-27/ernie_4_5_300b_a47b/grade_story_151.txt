<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is distinctive and her scientific mindset is woven well into her motives and actions, but her emotional transformation feels too abrupt and somewhat underdeveloped for her arc to fully resonate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and completes a satisfying arc within the word limit, but the climax's reliance on symbolic logic (planting snowflake patterns) risks feeling too abstract for full emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The imagery is evocative and immersive, with the setting—both visually and conceptually—enhancing the mood and themes; the "crystal shadows" tone is consistently sustained and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and subtext, with compelling themes of fear, hope, and organic logic, though the resolution moves slightly too quickly to fully land its emotional and philosophical implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Highly original metaphorical fusion of science and emotion; some overly poetic phrasing veers toward purple prose, and the snowflake motif feels slightly over-explained, diminishing its poetic mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive, conceptually ambitious, and stylistically unique; prose occasionally overreaches, but the story lingers through its emotional originality and philosophical tension.</comment>
