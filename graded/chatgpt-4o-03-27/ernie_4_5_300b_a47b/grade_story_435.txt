<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liraâ€™s motivation is clearly stated and mostly consistent, but her emotional depth and internal conflict feel underdeveloped given the stakes of impersonating someone to reshape law.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds effectively around the impersonation and vapor calcification, though the resolution comes a bit too easily, weakening final tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematic, and memorable with stylistic confidence, but slightly more emotional complexity would elevate it to the next tier.</comment>
