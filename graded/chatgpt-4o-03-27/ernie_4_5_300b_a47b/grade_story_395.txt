<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elinor’s internal conflict between duty and emotion is clearly established and evolves credibly; Jaxon’s rebelliousness is well illustrated through action and dialogue; motivations are clear though Elinor’s emotional shift feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with a strong arc and cause-effect clarity; pacing is brisk but effective; the climax and resolution align well with the story’s compact structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative use of setting and sensory detail—mist, music, and terraces build a vivid and unique atmosphere that enhances tension and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrent, effective use of metaphor in "tilting the rhythm"; theme of blending rebellion and duty is clear and integrated well; a few moments verge on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché, but some lines tread close to familiar tropes; the “fortune cookie” device is nearly too neat, though handled with restraint; originality is present but could be sharpened further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and atmospheric with strong thematic unity; assigned elements serve the narrative well; ending is resonant, though not quite transcendent.</comment>
