<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira is sharply characterized with a distinct, consistent voice—her pretentious politeness and obsessive dedication reveal both personality and motivation effectively within the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arc progresses clearly from research to ominous revelation, with cause-effect logic and a strong ending; however, the climax feels slightly rushed due to space constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is highly immersive and original—salt crystals, industrial dryers, and spectral oaks coalesce into a bizarre yet coherent atmosphere that supports tone and action exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story’s craft is strong, with vivid imagery, metaphor, and tension; though the ending is satisfying, the deeper theme of cultural change threatening reality could be more explicitly tied to Lira’s emotional arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Impressively original in both tone and execution; metaphors are fresh, dialogue is crisp, and there's no trace of formulaic or mechanical phrasing—style feels authorial, not procedural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A rich, layered narrative that integrates its strange elements into a coherent, thought-provoking story; strong sense of voice and momentum make it both memorable and re-readable.</comment>
