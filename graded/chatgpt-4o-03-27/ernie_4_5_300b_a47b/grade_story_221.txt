<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motivations are emotionally grounded and evolve convincingly; her relationship with her father's memory informs both her initial resistance and ultimate acceptance, though her "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" role could be more deeply integrated into her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story displays a strong arc with a satisfying emotional resolution and clear cause-effect momentum; transitions are smooth, but the climax (the shooting itself) lacks narrative tension or external stakes beyond interior catharsis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting is richly rendered with multisensory detail, and the atmosphere strongly supports the emotional and thematic elements; the fusion of nostalgia and decay is especially effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor (amber, shooting gallery) and a powerful emotional shift elevate the narrative; subtle symbolism and a resonant ending offer depth, though some imagery risks being slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite occasional lapses into familiar phrasing (“ghosts of summer nights”, “frozen in time”), the prose avoids formula and AI-pattern pitfalls through emotionally specific language and a cohesive, distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant piece with layered imagery and thematic unity; it feels complete and intentional within the word limit, though some elements (e.g., the ghost whisperer aspect) remain underutilized.</comment>
