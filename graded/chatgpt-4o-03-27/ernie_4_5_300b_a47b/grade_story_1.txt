<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is vividly drawn with a compelling internal conflict; his motivations feel organic and culminate meaningfully in emotional transformation, though his dialogue is absent, slightly limiting voice depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and resonant, with internal logic built around the unraveling; pacing is tight and satisfying, though the resolution skirts subtlety with a somewhat literal metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is haunting and immersive—details like mildew, dust, and heat viscerally evoke the pyramid's decay and echo Elias’s fears; setting and mood are tightly fused.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism of the net and unraveling is well-handled, prompting reflection; minor over-explication dampens subtext, but emotional and thematic resonance is strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Surprisingly original concept and specific metaphors elevate the story, though a few stylistic choices tip toward overwrought; writing feels human, not templated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally satisfying, and thematically unified; a few images verge on excess, but the narrative achieves weight and clarity within the short form.</comment>
