<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zib is a well-defined character whose nervous energy and analytical paranoia directly drive plot and theme; emotional depth isn't overwhelming, but motivation is clear and tied authentically to their personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story is impressively coherent given its abstraction and density; cause-effect relationships connect smoothly, though the resolution comes quickly and may underutilize tension built earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vexel City is vividly immersive, blending neon dystopia with mystical code—a rare, effective fusion of cyberpunk and mythopoeia; rich detail supports tone and theme throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story uses metaphor (glitches, code, decay) with sophistication and subtle thematic resonance; the conclusion delivers reflection, but emotional stakes feel slightly subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally original in worldbuilding and metaphorical use of digital decay; avoids clichés and AI-like predictability while building a textured, human-feeling narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive, imaginative, and literary in ambition; each element is meaningfully woven in, though minor tightening of emotional beats could elevate it further.</comment>
