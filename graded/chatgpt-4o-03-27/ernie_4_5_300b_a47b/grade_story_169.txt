<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zevyr's motivations and personality are clearly integrated with their role and method; they feel distinct, though deeper emotional nuance is lightly sketched rather than fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>There is a clear arc, with strong cause-effect links and a satisfying resolution, though the pacing verges on fragmented in places due to density of metaphor and abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and creatively realized; every element supports the whole, though emotional depth could be deepened further for top-tier polish.</comment>
