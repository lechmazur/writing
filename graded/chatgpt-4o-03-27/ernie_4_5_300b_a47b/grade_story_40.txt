<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marla’s character is emotionally rich and subtly rendered; her guilt and desire for change are woven into her actions and dialogue, though the chef's motivations feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot coheres well within the word limit, with a clear inciting incident leading to a symbolic resolution; the pacing is strong, but the transition from chef’s arrival to collaboration is a touch too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with sensory detail (like the storm and stew) grounding the surrealism of the forgotten library; the setting mirrors the thematic decay beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story skillfully balances metaphor and narrative, using literary devices to enrich meaning; the toy soldier functions as both symbol and emotional pivot, and the ending is thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Many metaphors are fresh and effective, with strong emotional nuance; a few moments verge on slightly ornate phrasing, but overall the piece avoids AI-like formula and surprises with originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A cohesive and thoughtfully layered narrative that marries theme and imagery with a sense of emotional progression and renewal; lingering impact is strong due to symbolic resolution.</comment>
