<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysander's character is strongly defined through metaphorical thought and action; his motivation aligns with his intellect and outsider status, though moments of emotional depth feel slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story presents a complete arc with efficient pacing, but the transition to the final reveal feels slightly abrupt and risks undermining earlier mystery with expository explanation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext, particularly around chess as ideology and exile; the ending is resonant but skirts sentimentality, and some dialogue is slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive concept with fresh imagery and unusual combinations; while dense with metaphor, the story feels authored rather than formulaic, with only minor moments of overwritten prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative, the story skillfully integrates theme, prose, and concept; a few transitions could be tighter, but overall shows uncommon literary control.</comment>
