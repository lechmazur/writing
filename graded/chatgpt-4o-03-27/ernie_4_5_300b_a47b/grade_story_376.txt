<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Astrid and Ragnar are both clearly motivated and multi-dimensional within a short frame; Astrid’s emotional archiving and Ragnar’s internal shift feel authentic, though Astrid’s voice could be sharpened slightly to elevate her distinctiveness further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-contained with a beginning, emotional middle, and satisfying resolution; minor pacing issues near the end prevent a perfect score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant storytelling with metaphorical resonance—the archive of emotional patterns is fresh and symbolic; dialogue is purposeful, though the central conflict could be more tightly wound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stylistically strong and relatively original—emotional nuance is shown rather than told, though the narrative occasionally brushes against lyrical excess and familiar archetypes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A superbly cohesive piece where every detail supports the emotional tapestry; minor over-description slightly distracts, but the story lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
