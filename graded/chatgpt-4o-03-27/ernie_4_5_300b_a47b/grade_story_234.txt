<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s internal contradictions—his yearning, his gentleness, his conflicted faith in love—are evocatively drawn; however, his evolution feels somewhat static across the narrative, with his motivation hinted at more than actively evolving through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is lyrical and atmospheric but relies more on emotional progression than structured plot; a loose sense of resolution is achieved, though the cause-effect of Kael’s actions and discoveries remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story’s setting is vividly immersive; the juxtaposition of ancient bones, technological interference, and spiritual seeking creates a haunting, layered atmosphere that enhances tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is thematically rich, with striking lyrical prose and metaphor; it evokes genuine emotion and reflection, though at times dips into opacity, making meaning elusive instead of profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("the dinosaur skeleton museum’s fluorescent lights humming like drowsy bees") and surprising image combinations avoid cliché; the voice is distinct and literary, with only occasional overreach into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive for its length, with the concept, tone, and imagery interwoven tightly; it impresses without feeling overengineered, though the resolution leans a bit too ethereal to fully satisfy all readers.</comment>
