<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation—to escape the shadow of his family’s failures—is clear and drives his actions, but his emotional arc remains somewhat surface-level; deeper psychological or emotional texture would enhance his evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong sense of arc with a clear beginning, middle, and transformative end; however, some transitions between quantum events feel slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors like “waves froze mid-crash” and “leaf map” stand out; overall avoids clichés and formula, though some lines edge toward over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive and polished with strong thematic cohesion; the integration of elements feels deliberate, though minor tonal inconsistencies limit it from reaching the pinnacle.</comment>
