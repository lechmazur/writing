<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are thoroughly embedded in her defiance and survival instincts; her background is conveyed convincingly through evocative details, but her emotional growth through the story remains somewhat abstract and externalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and mostly cohesive, with the mirrored illusions and cosmic rift creating a solid internal and external journey, though transitions between phases occasionally feel abrupt under the word count constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and tonally consistent throughout—the haunted park, orchard cat, and dying tree all reinforce the surreal, emotive environment that supports the character’s arc and the story’s metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story manages a lyrical, compact narrative with potent thematic resonance; it maintains coherence and leaves a memorable emotional impression despite minor structural unevenness.</comment>
