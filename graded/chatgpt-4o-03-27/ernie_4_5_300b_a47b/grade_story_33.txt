<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn with clear motivations tied to her history and symbolic tools; her emotional contradictions (anxious calm, nonviolence with simmering anger) add significant complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, unique juxtapositions (taxonomy and chaos), and an individual voice elevate the piece, though occasional overwriting edges toward performance rather than precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Unusual choices blend into a cohesive, thought-provoking narrative; while a few abstract turns may alienate some, the story lingers meaningfully.</comment>
