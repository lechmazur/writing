<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bleak clown has a distinct, consistent voice and motivation that shape his surreal actions; his use of poetry and destruction of illusion is aligned with his persona, though deeper emotional complexity remains unexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arc is compact but coherent, with a surreal cause-effect logic; the clownâ€™s arrival, disruption, and aftermath follow a clear trajectory, though some transitions feel abrupt in their extremity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wildly inventive with fresh metaphors, consistent style, and specific surreal imagery; mostly avoids the hallmarks of algorithmic composition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, compelling, and leaves a haunting impression; the ambition and execution both aim high, though slight over-saturation of metaphor softens clarity.</comment>
