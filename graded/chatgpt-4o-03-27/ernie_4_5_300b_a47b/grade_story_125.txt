<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s arc is compact yet distinct—her apathy, lineage, and motivation are woven clearly through her reactions and choices; her transformation feels earned, though her "voice" could be more differentiated for perfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story uses a tight structure with clear escalation and resolution; some transitions between scenes (e.g., station to farmland) could use marginal refinement, but causality flows logically and the arc is complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world-building is atmospheric and layered; the setting enhances theme and mood, with vivid sensory detail (e.g., "rust and regret") and strong integration of tone with physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thoughtfully layered with metaphor and emotional resonance; the motif of "exceptionally usual" recurs meaningfully. The ending is elegant, if slightly predictable. Strong use of literary craft overall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative resists cliché and handles emotion with subtlety; a few phrases toe the line of over-familiarity, but the combination of elements and tone remains fresh and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant story that feels deliberately composed rather than constrained by length; its emotional shift lingers, and its integration of disparate elements reflects real creativity.</comment>
