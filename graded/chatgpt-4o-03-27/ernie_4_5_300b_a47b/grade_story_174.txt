<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theo is smartly rendered, with his creative drive and quiet regret shaping his actions; his inner conflict—seeking redemption through art—emerges organically without overt exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with poetic logic and emotional cohesion, but the resolution, while thematically resonant, lacks a dramatic peak that makes it fully satisfying as a standalone arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh imagery and subtext-rich detail elevate the piece; minor lapses into familiar phrasing and soft emotion-labeling slightly diminish its originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity, elegant prose, and atmospheric cohesion make this near-publishable; a sharpening of plot tension or character revelation would bring it to top-tier readiness.</comment>
