<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flick’s personality is well-embodied through nervous tics, actions, and internal conflict; his transformation feels believable, though his emotional arc could be slightly more deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a compelling arc within its constraints, with strong causality and emotional resolution; still, the final transformation borders on overly neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details—lamp light, server glow, grating static—effectively support tone and world; minor expansion on sensory texture could deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolism and subtext enrich the story; the theme of redemption is well-woven, though some lines edge toward sentimentality rather than restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and inventive setting elevate the piece; a few phrases feel slightly conventional or overly stylized, but mostly avoided formula.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece feels carefully constructed, purposeful, and rich in theme; precise language aids clarity, and the fusion of narrative and concept is admirable.</comment>
