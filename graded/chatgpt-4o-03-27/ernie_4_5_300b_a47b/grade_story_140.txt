<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clara's internal conflict and protective impulse are consistently rendered, with her evolution—especially her moment of release—credibly driven by past trauma; however, the male character's motivations remain opaque, slightly weakening relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-structured for the word count, moving from eerie stillness to cathartic action with emotional clarity; the doll-smashing moment effectively anchors the story’s climax and resolution.</comment>
