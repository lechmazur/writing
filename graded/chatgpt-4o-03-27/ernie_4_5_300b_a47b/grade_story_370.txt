<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias is subtly but effectively developed; his quiet rebellion and connection to the comic and grandfather deepen his motivation, though Mara feels underdrawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story forms a clear arc with a satisfying resolution; pacing is strong, though connective logic between simulator mechanics and narrative stakes is vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and textured, especially the blend of high-tech and desert symbolism; however, "quantum foam" lacks grounding or clarity in function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance, poetic imagery, and emotional subtext; the symbolism of the comic is well-integrated, and the ending is understated yet powerful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stylistically distinct with some fresh metaphor; lacks cliché, though a few lines teeter on overwritten—"the desert sands drift" motif is slightly overused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally resonant, and largely cohesive; the story lingers in memory and uses its space efficiently without feeling constrained.</comment>
