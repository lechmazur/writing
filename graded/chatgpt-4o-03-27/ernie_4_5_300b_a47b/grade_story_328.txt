<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lila’s motivation is consistent and believable, her growth from passivity to defiance elegantly shown through interaction with the card and tapestry; her “assertively meek” demeanor is subtly but clearly subverted by story’s end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mirage oasis and digital-desert atmosphere are both immersive and resonant, vividly described through sensory and symbolic detail; the holographic world enhances tone and theme seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking and metaphor-rich prose supports layered theme; emotional payoff is earned and the image of the burning card as manifesto lingers—but some moments teeter on abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly woven elements coalesce into a resonant, stylistically mature whole; the story lingers emotionally and thematically, rising above prompt mechanics into near-publishable territory.</comment>
