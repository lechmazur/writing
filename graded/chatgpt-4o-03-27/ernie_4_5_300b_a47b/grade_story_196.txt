<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The swordsman’s apathy, guilt, and buried hope are subtly but effectively conveyed through his reactions and possessions; his arc is emotionally resonant and consistent, though some inner transitions could be explored more deeply.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tight, emotionally linear arc with a clear beginning, rising action, and resolution; pacing is strong, and the final image ties well to the opening, though the journey segment risks slight vagueness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric—dust motes, floating rocks, and meteor showers all create a metaphoric and immersive tone that reflects the swordsman’s internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Beautifully restrained prose with poetic resonance and emotional payoff; metaphor and symbolism are skillfully handled, though some themes might benefit from slightly more specificity or surprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Though built from recognizable archetypes, the story avoids clichés through delicate execution and a fresh emotional core; some phrasing edges toward the lyrical-obvious but mostly succeeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and understatedly powerful; the story lingers with emotional weight, though one or two story beats (especially in transition) could be honed for greater depth.</comment>
