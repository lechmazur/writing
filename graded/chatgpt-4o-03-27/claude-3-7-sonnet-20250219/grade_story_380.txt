<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Enzo is vividly drawn, with his obsession, limitations, and motivations coherently interwoven; his mathematically challenged mind contrasts poignantly with his intuitive dream-weaving, though his emotional arc could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and emotionally satisfying, with a clear arc from exile to redemption; however, the transition from dream-thief to dream-giver feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more internal conflict or resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric—haunting, tactile, and thematically resonant; the treehouse library and silent skies enhance the tone and support the character’s longing and fractured identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and poetic language elevate the narrative; the metaphor of thunder as wholeness is powerful, though some imagery borders on overwrought and could be pared for sharper impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original concept with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; avoids clichés and formulaic structure, though a few transitions feel slightly mechanical or abrupt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally rich, and thematically cohesive; the story lingers in the mind, though a touch more narrative tension or ambiguity could elevate it to literary excellence.</comment>
