<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vex is a well-drawn character with a clear arc from haunted mercenary to tentative creator; his motivations are consistent and emotionally resonant, though his transformation feels slightly accelerated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the journey to the cathedral and the act of painting provide a satisfying resolution, though the rumor chain is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and symbolically rich; the cathedral-turned-artist-haven enhances the theme of transformation and supports the tone and character arc beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally powerful and thematically layered, the story uses symbolism (amber, spider, painting) effectively; the ending is poignant and earned, though some metaphors verge on the familiar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh and emotionally nuanced, with strong imagery and subtext; avoids clich√©s and formulaic phrasing, though a few lines flirt with sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the elements serve the story rather than dominate it, and the brevity feels intentional rather than limiting.</comment>
