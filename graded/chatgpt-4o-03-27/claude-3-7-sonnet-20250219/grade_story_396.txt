<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elise is vividly drawn with a distinct personality—her forgetfulness, passion, and principles are consistent and nuanced; Henri is less developed but serves as a strong foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit; the negotiation drives the plot, though the pacing slightly compresses the emotional shift at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric—limestone walls, vintage chandeliers, and the subterranean vault all enhance tone and theme; sensory detail is immersive and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegant prose, layered symbolism (glass as fragility and history), and a satisfying thematic resolution; dialogue is natural and reveals character, though the ending is slightly idealized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and specific detail avoid cliché; the story feels authored, not templated, though Henri’s role edges toward archetype without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and emotional resonance; the elements feel integrated rather than imposed, and the story lingers with a sense of quiet transformation.</comment>
