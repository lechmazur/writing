<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias has a clear motivation and emotional arc, but his internal voice lacks depth and nuance; his transformation feels more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds to a satisfying climax, though the transition into the ghost station is abrupt and strains believability even within speculative bounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the contrast between sterile station and lost Earth is evocative and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., butter churn as conduit), though some emotional beats are told rather than shown; ending is impactful but slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept and imagery, but a few phrases verge on overwrought or generic; emotional nuance is present but occasionally flattened by exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally resonant with a cohesive structure; some transitions feel forced, but the story lingers meaningfully after reading.</comment>
