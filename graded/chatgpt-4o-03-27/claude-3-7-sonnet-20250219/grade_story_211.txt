<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Jasper is a compelling figure whose motivations evolve believably from gambler to reluctant savior to corrupted arbiter; however, secondary characters like Eliza are underdeveloped, limiting emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a strong arc with a clear beginning, middle, and haunting resolution; the spin-the-bottle mechanic is integrated well, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic setting is vividly rendered with evocative imagery; the schoolhouse and ghost town atmosphere enhance the tone and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., roots, rain, diary pages); the ending is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, though some transitions feel slightly too smooth to be fully organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh take on dystopian survival with original mechanics and tone; a few phrases verge on overly poetic, but overall the voice is distinct and avoids clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally impactful; the story lingers with the reader and uses its elements in service of a larger theme rather than as scaffolding.</comment>
