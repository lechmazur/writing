<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezekiel is vividly drawn with a distinct voice and consistent motivation; his clumsy eloquence and theatricality align well with his con artist persona, though secondary characters like Dr. Mara are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the climax feels slightly rushed and the mechanics of the "reversed moments" are more symbolic than structurally grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The contrast between the sterile lab and Ezekielâ€™s chaotic mysticism is evocative and immersive, enhancing both mood and theme with strong sensory and tonal detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext, particularly around belief and illusion; the ending resonates, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh concept and voice with clever subversion of science/mysticism tropes; a few phrases verge on purple prose, but overall the originality and nuance shine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and thematically rich; the story lingers after reading, though a touch more clarity in the method would elevate it further.</comment>
