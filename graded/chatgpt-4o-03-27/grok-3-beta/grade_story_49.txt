<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s emotional connection to the doormat and his quiet resolve are well-developed and consistent; his magic’s tie to emotion deepens his characterization, though his “lukewarm” nature could be more distinctly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit; the fog-conjured silhouettes effectively drive the plot, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the transition into the communal hall could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lunar base is vividly rendered with strong sensory and emotional atmosphere; Earth’s presence and the sterile dome enhance the tone and reinforce the theme of isolation and hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (doormat, fog, silhouettes); the emotional arc is resonant and the ending satisfying, though some phrasing borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally avoids clichés and shows emotional nuance, but some metaphors feel slightly too polished or literary, risking a sense of artificiality; still, the story maintains a unique voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and purpose; the story feels complete and thematically rich, though a few transitions and stylistic choices could be refined for greater clarity and impact.</comment>
