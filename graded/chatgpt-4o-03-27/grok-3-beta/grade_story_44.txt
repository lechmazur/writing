<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s character is vividly drawn with consistent motivation and a distinct voice; her transformation mirrors the lamp’s, though her “feisty stablehand” origin could be more deeply integrated into her current persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the magical mechanism (tickets + lamp) feels slightly underexplained, weakening internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and supports the theme well; sensory details like “stardust-coated tools” and “rattled highways” enhance immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and emotional resonance, especially in the lamp’s transformation; however, the story leans toward telling over showing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise and poetic language, but some metaphors verge on overwrought and the carnival ticket method feels slightly arbitrary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite minor logic gaps, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich, with a memorable central image and voice.</comment>
