<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s muted voice, ghostly interactions, and obsessive cooking are well-aligned with her motivation to foster peace; her character is distinct and emotionally resonant, though her internal arc could be deepened slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit, with strong cause-effect logic; however, the pacing slightly compresses the climax, and the street fair encounter feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The haunted log flume is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and a surreal tone that enhances the narrative’s emotional and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, layered symbolism (music box, stew, lullabies), and emotional subtext create a powerful, memorable narrative; minor moments of exposition slightly weaken the “show, don’t tell” balance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original concept and setting with fresh metaphors and emotional nuance; a few phrases verge on ornate, and the street fair feels like a narrative convenience rather than an organic development.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion and emotional resonance; the story feels complete and purposeful, with creative integration of elements and a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
