<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn’s agoraphobia is deeply integrated into her character arc, and her motivation to overcome inherited fear is clear and emotionally resonant; however, her transformation feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the snuffbox and rain method are well integrated, though the resolution arrives a bit too conveniently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering dunes and rare desert rain create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that mirrors Evelyn’s internal struggle; sensory details are evocative and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror, rain, crack), emotional resonance, and subtext; the story shows rather than tells, though the ending could benefit from more ambiguity or complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and purple prose, with fresh metaphors and a consistent tone; a few phrases verge on overly ornate, but overall the voice feels distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>All elements are meaningfully integrated, and the story leaves a lasting emotional impression; a slightly more nuanced climax would elevate it further.</comment>
