<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, and her actions align with her internal conflict; her connection to the dragonfly and her decision to seek Kael are consistent and revealing, though Kael’s development is thinner.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution within the word limit; the forge pursuit is a strong narrative thread, though the transition from hospital to rebellion feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The contrast between the sterile hospital and the primal forge is vivid and thematically rich; sensory details are evocative and support the mood and character’s emotional state effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (dragonfly, forge); emotional resonance is high, and the theme of corrupted innocence is well-executed, though some phrasing borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mostly avoids cliché and shows originality in concept and tone, but a few phrases feel slightly too polished or poetic, risking artificiality; overall, the voice is distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements serve the story’s emotional and thematic arc; the narrative feels cohesive and deliberate, with a lingering sense of loss and hope that elevates it beyond its brevity.</comment>
