<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clear, emotionally resonant, and consistent with her lineage and mission; her spiritual secularism and symbolic use of the button deepen her character meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear inciting moment, climax, and resolution; however, the pacing slightly compresses the emotional payoff at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and purpose; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though a slightly subtler ending might elevate it further.</comment>
