<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris is well-developed with a clear internal conflict—her claustrophobia—and her motivations and emotional arc are consistent and nuanced; her use of the glasses and jam ritual deepens her characterization meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a satisfying emotional resolution; the pacing is well-managed, though the central action (jam tasting) feels slightly metaphor-heavy and risks slowing narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and purpose; the story feels complete and leaves a lingering emotional impression, though a touch more narrative tension would enhance impact.</comment>
