<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sigrid is vividly drawn with a unique motivation and consistent behavior; Freya’s emotional arc is believable, though her development is slightly compressed due to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emotional arc is clear and satisfying, but the zigzag pacing of the wine ritual could feel slightly contrived; still, the structure holds well within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive, with sensory detail and atmosphere enhancing tone and theme; the longhouse and auroras feel integral, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance, layered symbolism (inkwell, wine, fire), and a satisfying resolution; the story shows rather than tells, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original concept and voice, with fresh metaphors and subtext; a few phrases flirt with purple prose, but overall avoids cliché and formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally impactful; the elements feel organically integrated, and the story lingers with thematic depth and stylistic confidence.</comment>
