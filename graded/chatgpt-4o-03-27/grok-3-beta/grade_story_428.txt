<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s transformation from city planner to doomsday prepper is convincingly rendered, with his motivations and internal conflict clearly tied to his past and present actions; however, his emotional arc could benefit from more nuanced shifts rather than declarative statements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains coherence and a clear arc within the word limit, with the handshake and descent into the temple forming a satisfying structure; still, the climax feels slightly muted due to a lack of external stakes or tension beyond the internal journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details and symbolic carvings enhancing the mood and mirroring Marcus’s psyche; the integration of incense, decay, and celestial imagery is particularly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is thematically rich and emotionally resonant, with strong symbolism (ink blotter, constellations), though some metaphors verge on overwrought and the ending, while purposeful, lacks a final emotional jolt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in concept and execution, though occasional phrasing feels slightly mechanical or overly ornate, hinting at formulaic tendencies in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thoughtfully constructed, with all elements serving the central theme of transformation and doubt; while not flawless, it shows literary ambition and emotional depth.</comment>
