<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, and her personality—obsessive, intuitive, and reckless—shapes her actions meaningfully; however, her “ingeniously clueless” trait could be more clearly dramatized through specific missteps or flawed logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with strong cause-effect logic and pacing; however, the method (housekeeping logs) feels under-integrated and slightly tacked on, weakening structural cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and metaphor, enhancing mood and theme; the roller coaster’s decay mirrors the story’s temporal instability and Elara’s unraveling psyche.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative prose, rich symbolism, and a resonant ending elevate the story’s impact; however, some metaphors verge on overwrought, and the emotional arc could benefit from more contrast or modulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic flair, some phrasing feels overly ornate or abstract, and the method element is underdeveloped, suggesting slight formulaic scaffolding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, with strong thematic unity and emotional resonance; minor weaknesses in method integration and occasional overwriting prevent a higher score.</comment>
