<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tobin’s motivation is deeply rooted in grief and obsession, and his actions consistently reflect this; his personality is vividly rendered through his manic focus and symbolic gestures, though his "jovial" trait is underutilized beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the pacing is strong, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the metronome method underdeveloped in terms of plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic is richly atmospheric, with sensory details that mirror Tobin’s psyche; the setting and timeframe enhance the mood and theme effectively, though the train moment could be more integrated emotionally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the earring, metronome, forge), with a resonant theme of defiance against despair; the ending is emotionally satisfying, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Displays originality in concept and tone, with fresh metaphors and a unique setting; a few phrases verge on purple prose, and the metronome’s role feels more symbolic than functional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant, with strong thematic unity and vivid style; minor weaknesses in method integration and tonal consistency prevent a perfect score.</comment>
