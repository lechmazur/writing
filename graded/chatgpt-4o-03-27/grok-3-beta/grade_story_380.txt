<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is vividly rendered, with his fractured psyche and obsession clearly tied to his past crimes and emotional void; his motivations are consistent and compelling, though some internal voices could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a strong arc and emotional climax, but the plunge into the mind and the summoning of thunder feel more symbolic than narratively resolved, leaving a slight gap in cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and deeply integrated with the character’s isolation and mental state; sensory details and tone reinforce the post-human, decaying world effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and symbolism, especially the thunder/volleyball motif; emotionally resonant and thematically layered, though the ending leans more poetic than conclusive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, with fresh metaphors and a unique premise; a few phrases verge on overwrought, but overall avoids cliché and demonstrates strong authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally impactful; the elements feel organically woven, and the story lingers in the mind, though a slightly clearer resolution would elevate it further.</comment>
