<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marvin’s motivations are clear and consistent, and his arc from bitterness to hope is well-drawn, though Lila’s character feels underdeveloped and their bond slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc and logical progression, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, though the climax feels slightly convenient and the pacing occasionally uneven.</comment>
