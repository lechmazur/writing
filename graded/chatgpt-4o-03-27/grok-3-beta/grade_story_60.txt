<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Torvald's transformation from apathy to quiet yearning is convincingly rendered through his interaction with the objects and setting, though his emotional arc could benefit from more nuanced internal conflict or dialogue to deepen his voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the ritual's mechanics remain somewhat vague.</comment>
