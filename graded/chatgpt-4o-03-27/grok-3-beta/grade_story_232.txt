<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the action of interpreting symbols drives the plot; still, the resolution feels slightly rushed and could benefit from a more tangible turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and richly textured, with evocative sensory details and a setting that enhances the protagonist’s isolation and obsession; the digital nomad camp and twilight horizon are used effectively to mirror Elias’s inner state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (cutlass, coffee grounds) creates emotional resonance and thematic depth; the story lingers, though the ending could be more surprising or emotionally climactic to fully satisfy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic flair, some phrases verge on overwrought, and the coffee-ground divination feels slightly contrived; still, the voice is distinct and the imagery largely original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with a compelling blend of mysticism and obsession; it leaves a lasting impression, though a sharper emotional climax would elevate it further.</comment>
