<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysa’s empathic nature is consistently portrayed through her actions and motivations, and her quiet resolve aligns well with her introversion; however, her internal voice could be more distinct to elevate her individuality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and emotionally satisfying, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing occasionally drifts into languid introspection that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and deeply integrated with the character’s emotional journey; sensory details and tone effectively immerse the reader in the asteroid’s melancholic refuge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism is layered and effective, particularly the marionette and starfish, though the story leans heavily on metaphor at times, risking abstraction over clarity; emotional resonance is strong but could benefit from more tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrasing veers toward ornate or overly poetic, and a few metaphors feel slightly contrived rather than organically arising from the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with a clear emotional throughline and thoughtful integration of elements; it leaves a lingering impression, though it stops just short of profound originality.</comment>
