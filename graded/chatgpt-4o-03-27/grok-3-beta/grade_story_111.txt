<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motivations are clearly articulated and emotionally resonant, with his actions—especially the ritualistic stone-throwing and use of the ribbon—deeply aligned with his internal struggle; however, his voice lacks a bit of distinctiveness beyond archetypal melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing occasionally leans toward the meditative at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and demonstrates originality in its metaphors and setting, some language choices feel slightly too ornate or abstract, risking detachment from emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant, with creative integration of elements; minor stylistic excesses prevent it from reaching flawless execution.</comment>
