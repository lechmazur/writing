<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict is well-drawn, and her motivation to chronicle forgotten revolutions aligns with her emotional arc, though her “anxiously calm” trait is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, with the climax (the ghost encounter) feeling rushed and underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (comb, bridge, waterfall) creates emotional resonance, though the ending could land with more impact if the ghost’s dialogue were more distinct.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some phrasing veers toward ornate or abstract, and the tone occasionally slips into generic melancholy, but the imagery and emotional nuance mostly feel authentic and original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with creative integration of elements, though a few moments feel slightly contrived or overwritten.</comment>
