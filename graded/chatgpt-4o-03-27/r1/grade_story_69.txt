<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The druid’s uncertainty and tether to obligation are well-developed through her actions and internal conflict; her voice is distinct, though her motivation could be more deeply explored beyond the audition lie.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the audition drives the plot effectively, though the callback moment feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined with vivid sensory detail—neon alleys, glitchy projections, and bioluminescent lilies create a striking, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story’s tone and themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and layered symbolism (seeds, light, chaos); the story shows rather than tells, and the ending lingers, though the dialogue is minimal and slightly stylized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly original blend of druidic magic and cyberpunk decay; metaphors are fresh and specific, with no reliance on clichés or formulaic structure—voice and tone feel authorial, not generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative; the elements feel integrated rather than forced, and the story leaves a lasting impression of tension between duty and transformation.</comment>
