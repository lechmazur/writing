<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlow’s transformation from janitor to prophet is compelling and emotionally resonant, with his motivations unfolding organically through action and vision; however, some secondary characters (e.g., Mrs. Voss) feel more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end, though some transitions—particularly between visions and reality—veer toward abstraction, slightly weakening narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and surreal imagery that enhance the tone and reinforce the story’s metaphysical stakes; the giant’s study and laundromat are especially evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., the flower, threads, fractured minds) creates emotional and thematic depth; the ending is both unsettling and satisfying, though some moments flirt with overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; a few phrases verge on purple prose, but overall the story avoids formulaic patterns and cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically bold; the story lingers in the mind and feels complete despite its brevity, though a touch more clarity in transitions would elevate it further.</comment>
