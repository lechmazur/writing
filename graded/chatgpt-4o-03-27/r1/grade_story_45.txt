<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—sacrificing comfort and safety to restore life—align with her emotional arc; however, her internal voice remains distant, limiting deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with strong cause-effect progression and a satisfying resolution; the transition from temple to jungle is fluid, though the dirigible’s sudden appearance strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with paradoxical architecture and sensory detail enhancing mood and theme; the atmosphere supports both character and concept seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphor elevate the narrative, with strong thematic cohesion around rebirth and contradiction; the emotional impact is subtle but lasting, though some moments verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique tone; a few phrases flirt with purple prose, and emotional nuance could be deepened, but overall avoids formulaic pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and emotionally resonant, the story integrates its elements with purpose and artistry; minor clarity issues and occasional abstraction prevent a perfect score.</comment>
