<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pilotâ€™s arc from disoriented survivor to reluctant savior is compelling and emotionally resonant; his cynicism and hope are well-balanced, though his internal transformation could be more deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; the dissemination of herbs drives the climax effectively, though the speed dating setup feels slightly ornamental rather than integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined with vivid sensory detail and a haunting atmosphere; the observatory, orchard, and magical realism elements cohere beautifully to support tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism, and a powerful emotional undercurrent elevate the storytelling; the ending is poetic and thematically rich, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution with fresh metaphors and a unique tone; a few moments of slightly florid language and one or two genre tropes prevent a perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and emotionally resonant; the story lingers with the reader and demonstrates a high level of craft, though one or two elements feel slightly under-integrated.</comment>
