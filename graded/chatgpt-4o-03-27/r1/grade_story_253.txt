<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivations are clearly tied to his past betrayals and ambition, and his silence, pride, and limp all reinforce a coherent character arc; however, Lira’s role feels underdeveloped, limiting relational depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the time inversion climax is effective, though the pacing slightly compresses the emotional fallout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with vivid sensory details and a consistent tone that enhances the narrative’s surreal, decayed futurism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism, and a resonant theme of sacrifice and fractured identity elevate the storytelling; the harp and chip metaphors are especially effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While some phrasing borders on ornate, the story avoids cliché and demonstrates a unique voice with fresh metaphors and emotional nuance; a few transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant, with a strong sense of purpose and originality; minor character underdevelopment prevents a perfect score.</comment>
