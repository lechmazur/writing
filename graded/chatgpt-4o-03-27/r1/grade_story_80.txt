<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s personality—daring, obsessive, and ingeniously clueless—is vividly conveyed through her actions and internal logic; however, her emotional depth and evolution remain somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc and satisfying resolution; minor leaps in logic (e.g., vinegar as a solution) slightly strain coherence but are thematically justified.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details and surreal imagery that enhance tone and theme; the roller coaster and fog are especially evocative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and emotionally resonant; the story lingers with thematic depth and stylistic flair, though not entirely flawless in clarity.</comment>
