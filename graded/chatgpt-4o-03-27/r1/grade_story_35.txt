<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s quiet demeanor and emotional repression are convincingly rendered through her actions and internal responses; her motivation to decode emotional language is subtly but clearly tied to her personal history, though her arc could benefit from slightly more dynamic evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant resolution; the purse discovery effectively drives the plot, though the translator’s appearance feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory details (loam, lavender, birdsong) enhancing the emotional tone; the Universal Translation Center is both literal and metaphorical, deepening the story’s thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally evocative and layered with metaphor and symbolism; the story’s subtext about grief, memory, and nonverbal communication is powerful and artfully conveyed through imagery and structure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; a few phrases verge on poetic excess, but overall the prose avoids cliché and demonstrates strong authorial control.</comment>
