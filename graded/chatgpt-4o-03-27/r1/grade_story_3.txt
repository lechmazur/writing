<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The watchman’s surliness is consistently portrayed through tone and action, and his motivation—to decipher cosmic patterns—is clearly tied to his training and the yarn; however, his emotional depth remains somewhat abstracted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear inciting incident, rising tension, and resolution; the riddle and spectral confrontation drive the narrative effectively, though some transitions verge on poetic obscurity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and a haunting tone that enhances the story’s metaphysical stakes; the sailor’s graveyard and liminal season are deeply integrated into mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism (yarn, knots, tides) conveys layered meaning; the story evokes reflection on desire, balance, and mortality, though some phrasing risks overwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique voice; avoids clichés and formulaic structure, though a few lines flirt with purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and thematically resonant; the elements feel organically interwoven, and the story lingers with philosophical weight and stylistic confidence.</comment>
