<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist is vividly drawn, with her grief, precision, and sardonic edge shaping every action; her motivations are clear and consistent, though her transformation into a conspiracy-unraveling vigilante stretches believability slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and satisfying within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution; however, the leap from finding a seal to exposing a drone conspiracy feels slightly compressed and could benefit from more connective tissue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospherically potent, with strong sensory details and symbolic resonance between orchard and facility; the sterile-to-organic contrast enhances the mood and theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, with striking metaphors and a unique voice; the final image is powerful and memorable, though some transitions verge on poetic excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original in tone and concept, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive narrative style; a few moments flirt with over-stylization, but overall the voice feels human, specific, and emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and imaginative, with all elements serving the narrativeâ€™s emotional and thematic core; the story lingers after reading, though a touch more clarity in the conspiracy mechanics would elevate it further.</comment>
