<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ventriloquist is vividly rendered through her silence, her archiving impulse, and her use of Jasper as voice and shield; her motivations are consistent and layered, though Jasper occasionally overshadows her emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear emotional progression from isolation to connection; however, the payphone conceit, while compelling, risks slight overuse without deeper escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and thematically layered, the story uses metaphor and subtext masterfully; Jasper’s dialogue is sharp and poignant, though the ending could land with slightly more weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; a few lines flirt with over-stylization, but overall the prose is inventive and human in nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive and emotionally rich; the elements feel organically integrated, and the story lingers with thematic resonance and stylistic confidence.</comment>
