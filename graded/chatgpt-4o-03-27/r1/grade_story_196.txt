<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swordsman’s arc is emotionally resonant and consistent; his apathy, guilt, and eventual defiance are well-motivated and revealed through action and symbol, though his voice could be slightly more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear inciting incident, rising tension, and cathartic resolution; pacing is tight, though the leap to the forge feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and thematically rich—celestial imagery, sensory detail, and the monastery’s isolation all reinforce the character’s inner journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Powerful use of symbolism (top, sword, meteor shower), emotional payoff, and layered subtext; the prose is lyrical without excess, and the ending is both surprising and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique setting elevate the narrative; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, though a few phrases verge on poetic overreach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the story lingers after reading and uses its elements with purpose and creativity, though a few transitions could be smoother.</comment>
