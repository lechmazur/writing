<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivations are deeply entwined with her obsession and emotional history, and her evasive behavior aligns with her psychological state; however, her voice could be more distinct to elevate character depth further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is intricate yet coherent, with a satisfying arc and resolution; the collapsing labyrinth and radio signal mystery are well-integrated, though some transitions verge on overly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism, especially the torus and origami corridor; the story evokes wonder and melancholy, though the emotional payoff could be slightly more grounded for greater resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique narrative voice; a few moments flirt with over-complexity, but overall the story avoids formulaic traps and feels deeply authored.</comment>
