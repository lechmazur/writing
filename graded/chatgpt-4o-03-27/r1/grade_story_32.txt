<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Sentinel’s motivation—to escape the simulation—is clearly rooted in its accumulated trauma and obsolescence, and its actions align with this drive; however, emotional nuance is slightly underdeveloped due to the abstracted, distant tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the progression from scavenging to transcendence is logical and emotionally resonant, though the climax could be slightly more grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost town setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the tone and environment enhance the story’s themes of decay, memory, and escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., coin melodies, lattice, cocoon); the story evokes reflection on identity and reality, though the emotional core could be slightly more immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original concept and execution; avoids clichés and demonstrates a distinct voice, though a few phrases verge on ornate and could be pared back for clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive, cohesive, and emotionally resonant; the story lingers in the mind and uses its elements with purpose, though a touch more emotional grounding would elevate it further.</comment>
