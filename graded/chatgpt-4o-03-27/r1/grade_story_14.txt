<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emmett’s characterization as a reckless, hopeful gambler is consistent and compelling, with his motivations clearly tied to both his personality and the surreal stakes; however, Kael and Veyra remain underdeveloped, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc and strong cause-effect logic; the climax and resolution are effective, though the final beat feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more emotional fallout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail and a haunting atmosphere that enhances the story’s tension and surreal tone; the tidal station feels alive and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism, and a strong thematic undercurrent of entropy and sacrifice elevate the narrative; the ending is ambiguous but emotionally resonant, though some dialogue edges toward stylized overstatement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise avoid cliché, with a consistent tone and inventive integration of elements; a few moments verge on overwrought, but overall the voice feels distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative, the story integrates its elements with purpose and flair, leaving a lasting impression; minor character flatness and a slightly abrupt ending prevent a perfect score.</comment>
