<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bard’s minimalist ethos and quiet rebellion are consistently portrayed through her actions and internal reflections; her motivation to escape AI control is clear and aligns with her symbolic use of the deck and flute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the retreating tide and creature’s emergence provide a satisfying resolution, though the middle risks slight abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative language, layered symbolism, and a resonant theme of resisting determinism elevate the story; the final image of footprints dissolving is both poetic and thematically potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice avoid cliché; the story feels authored rather than generated, with emotional nuance and originality in its speculative premise and lyrical execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative; the elements serve the narrative rather than constrain it, and the story lingers with a sense of mythic transformation and quiet defiance.</comment>
