<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vale’s grief-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions—ritualistic, desperate, methodical—align with his emotional state; however, his voice lacks some distinctiveness beyond archetypal brooding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a clear arc and resolution; the pacing is excellent, and the ritual’s timing adds urgency, though the dream-analysis method is underdeveloped and barely integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail and a haunting atmosphere that enhances the story’s tone and themes; the island and lighthouse feel integral to the narrative’s emotional and symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, strong symbolism (ink, dreams, coffee), and emotional resonance elevate the story; the ending is poignant and thematically satisfying, though the specter’s dialogue borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise show originality, though the dream-analysis method feels more like a narrative excuse than a fully realized mechanism; emotional nuance is strong but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Despite minor weaknesses, the story is cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically confident; it feels complete and lingers in the mind, suggesting depth beyond its word count.</comment>
