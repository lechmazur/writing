<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s internal conflict between logic and emotion is well-drawn and consistent, with his actions—especially choosing the illogical path—reinforcing his personality and motivation; however, his voice could be more distinct beyond the poetic narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with a clear arc, strong cause-effect logic, and a satisfying resolution; the countdown adds urgency, though the trap sequence feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly sensory—jasmine, mildew, bioluminescence—creating a vivid, surreal world that enhances tension and theme; the whispering gallery and subterranean garden are especially evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (key, garden, dust), with emotional resonance and thematic depth; the ending is poignant and reflective, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality is high with fresh metaphors and a unique blend of elements; a few phrases verge on purple prose, and the garden scent as a guide strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the story feels complete and deliberate, with creative integration of elements and a lingering thematic impact.</comment>
