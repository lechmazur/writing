<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonistâ€™s motivations are layered and compelling, with her spice-trader background subtly informing her decoding of the flower; however, the emotional arc with the director feels slightly rushed and underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the pacing is tight, though the kiss moment slightly strains plausibility in tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., flower as map, crayons as alchemy); the story evokes reflection on legacy and restoration, though the emotional climax could be more earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story; a few phrases verge on ornate, and the kiss trope feels slightly familiar, but overall the execution is inventive and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and imaginative; the elements are mostly well-integrated, and the story lingers with a sense of wonder and melancholy, though a few transitions feel slightly compressed.</comment>
