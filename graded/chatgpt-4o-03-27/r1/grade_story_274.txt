<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plant’s internal conflict—devotion versus resentment—is well-articulated and consistent, with its actions (escaping, retrieving the journal, typing) clearly motivated by a desire to be heard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a beginning (final keystroke), middle (quest for the journal), and end (typed message), though the drive-in collapse feels slightly abrupt in pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through tactile and visual details; the apartment and drive-in are both vivid and thematically resonant with the plant’s emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (roots, silence, ink), with a poignant emotional payoff; the final word “Listen” is both literal and thematic, enhancing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh concept and voice; avoids clichés and purple prose, though a few metaphors verge on overwrought; emotional nuance is well-handled through subtext and imagery.</comment>
