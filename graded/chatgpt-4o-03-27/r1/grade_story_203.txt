<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The exorcist’s stage fright and inherited trauma are deeply interwoven into their actions and voice, creating a compelling, psychologically rich character; however, some emotional beats feel slightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution, but the transition into the climax—particularly the gravity shift and confrontation—feels slightly abrupt and could benefit from smoother pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail—orbital debris, toy drones, and lavender scent all contribute to a haunting, immersive atmosphere that enhances the story’s emotional and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery, layered symbolism (flowers, ghosts, inheritance), and a resonant emotional arc elevate the story’s impact; the ending is poetic and thematically satisfying, though some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique blend of sci-fi and spiritual horror; a few moments flirt with purple prose, but overall the voice is distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Despite the density of elements, the story feels cohesive and purposeful, with strong thematic unity and emotional resonance; a few transitions could be more fluid, but the overall effect is powerful and memorable.</comment>
