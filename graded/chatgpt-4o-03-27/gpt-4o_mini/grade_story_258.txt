<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara has a clear motivation and some symbolic depth, but her personality lacks nuance and emotional complexity; her voice feels more archetypal than individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but the logic connecting the yearbooks, map, and tree is tenuous, and transitions feel overly poetic rather than plot-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and sensory details are evocative, though the surrealism occasionally overwhelms clarity and weakens grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor elevate the prose, but emotional resonance is muted by abstraction and a lack of tension or stakes; the ending is lyrical but predictable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and setting, but the language veers into purple prose and the metaphors feel recycled; lacks the unpredictability or specificity of truly fresh work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative and cohesive in tone, but the story leans heavily on atmosphere at the expense of narrative urgency or character depth; memorable but not fully compelling.</comment>
