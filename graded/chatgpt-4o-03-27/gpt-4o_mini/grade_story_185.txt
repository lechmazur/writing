<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are emotionally resonant and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond the central metaphor; her “infuriating calm” is told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the plot progression leans heavily on internal reflection, limiting narrative tension or external stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The setting is intriguing but underdeveloped; “probability mapping center” and “millennia colliding” are evocative but not grounded in sensory or spatial detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emotionally cohesive and thematically unified, but the story’s impact is dulled slightly by vague worldbuilding and a lack of narrative surprise.</comment>
