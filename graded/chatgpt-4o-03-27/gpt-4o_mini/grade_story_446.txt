<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with a clear motivation and emotional arc, though his transformation feels slightly idealized and lacks deeper internal conflict or contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc and logical progression, but the climax (the charity event) feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more tension or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and supports the tone and themes well; sensory details like fireflies and petals are evocative and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly in the transformation of emotion; however, the emotional resolution is a bit too tidy for full impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on the generic or overly poetic, and the prose occasionally leans into abstraction rather than specificity, slightly weakening authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a clear theme and elegant structure, though it stops short of true narrative risk or surprise.</comment>
