<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s internal conflict is well-drawn, with his arrogance masking deep insecurity; his transformation through song is believable and emotionally resonant, though his voice could be more distinct in dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution within the word limit; the pacing is tight and effective, though the transition from skepticism to singing could use slightly more buildup for full credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard is richly evoked with sensory detail, and the atmosphere of quiet introspection supports the theme; the tapestry and ink-scented air enhance the mood and symbolism.</comment>
