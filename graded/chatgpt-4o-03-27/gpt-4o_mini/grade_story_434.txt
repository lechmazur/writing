<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara is distinct and emotionally resonant, with a clear motivation and symbolic connection to the napkin and orb, though her arc lacks deeper complexity or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the central action of "outmaneuvering" the shadows is more atmospheric than plot-driven, weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and tone; the ghost story booth and carnival echoes are immersive and thematically aligned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, especially the orb and napkin; emotional resonance is present, though the conflict remains largely internal and abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some phrasing veers toward ornate or generic, and while the story avoids clich√©s, it occasionally feels like it's following a familiar ghost-story template.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a cohesive tone, but the story leans more on mood than narrative innovation; it lingers emotionally but not conceptually.</comment>
