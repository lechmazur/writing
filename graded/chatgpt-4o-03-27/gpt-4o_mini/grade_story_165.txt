<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her personality lacks depth beyond her gentleness; her emotional arc is underdeveloped and largely static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing feels compressed and the climax slightly rushed; transitions between key moments are too smooth to feel earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground setting is evocative and sensory details are strong, but the atmosphere of “joyful terror” is inconsistently realized and underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Competent and cohesive, but lacks the emotional resonance or stylistic distinction required for top-tier publication; feels more like a polished draft than a finished piece.</comment>
