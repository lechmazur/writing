<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s personality is gently sketched, and her motivation—while present—lacks urgency or specificity; her emotional arc is more implied than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the middle feels diffuse; the action of “precipitating change” is more symbolic than concrete, weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>
