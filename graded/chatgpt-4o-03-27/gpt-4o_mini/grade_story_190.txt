<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s shift from smuggler to empathetic collaborator is intriguing but underdeveloped; her cautious nature and impulsiveness are mentioned but not deeply dramatized through action or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the plot relies heavily on abstract dialogue and lacks concrete stakes or tension to drive momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative in concept but underutilized; the drought prediction center feels more metaphorical than grounded, limiting atmospheric immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., butterfly, symphony), but emotional beats are sometimes told rather than shown; dialogue carries weight but borders on the overly poetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but moments of vague abstraction and familiar tropes (artist as prophet, smuggler with a heart) reduce freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Thoughtful and cohesive with a resonant theme, but lacks the narrative sharpness and specificity required for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
