<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn, with her obsession and emotional contradictions well-aligned with her actions; however, her "optimistically bitter" trait could be more sharply dramatized in her choices or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing occasionally drifts into introspection at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally satisfying, with a strong thematic throughline and creative integration of elements, though not quite transcendent in originality.</comment>
