<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael’s internal conflict is compelling, but his transformation feels abrupt and underdeveloped given the gravity of his past; his motivation is poetic but lacks grounding in concrete backstory or stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional pivot, but the climax hinges on a sudden change of heart that feels more symbolic than earned; pacing is smooth but resolution is too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative in tone but underutilized in action; the baroque asteroid and timeframe are atmospheric but feel more decorative than integral to the plot’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, particularly the spider’s web and camera lens, but the emotional impact is dulled by abstract phrasing and a lack of visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and thematic ambition, but lapses into vague, ornamental language and familiar tropes (assassin with a conscience); lacks the sharp specificity of truly original work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a clear emotional arc, but its poetic tone sometimes obscures clarity and the character’s shift feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>
