<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict and motivation are clear and emotionally resonant, but her personality lacks distinctiveness beyond her powers and melancholy; her “strictly casual” attribute is not meaningfully integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc with a reflective resolution, and the revival attempt provides a clear climax, though the pacing slightly lingers in introspection at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on the familiar, and the prose occasionally leans toward ornate, but the story avoids clichés and demonstrates a mostly original voice with emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative use of elements and a lingering emotional tone, though some elements feel more decorative than essential.</comment>
