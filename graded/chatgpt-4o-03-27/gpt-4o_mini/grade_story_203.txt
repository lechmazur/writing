<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s internal conflict is clear and her motivation is emotionally grounded, but her personality lacks distinctiveness and her voice is somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed and some transitions are abrupt, especially in the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and metaphor, but the prose occasionally veers into vague or formulaic phrasing, and emotional nuance is often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the polish and specificity required for top-tier publication; more vivid detail and sharper voice would elevate it.</comment>
