<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kaelâ€™s motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth beyond archetypal zeal; his voice is generic and internal conflict is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and logical flow, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the resolution feels rushed; transitions are smooth but predictable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but execution leans on familiar tropes and vague metaphors; language occasionally veers into purple prose and lacks specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competent and cohesive, but not exceptional; the story integrates elements reasonably well, though it feels constructed around them rather than organically driven.</comment>
