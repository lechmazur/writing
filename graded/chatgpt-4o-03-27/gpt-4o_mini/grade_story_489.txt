<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The observer's motivation to preserve tradition is present but underdeveloped; their "aggressively kind" trait is more told than shown, and the dancer lacks depth beyond her role as a symbolic vessel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the connection between the observer’s action and the dancer’s transformation feels overly symbolic and slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is atmospheric and well-evoked through sensory detail, enhancing the mood and supporting the story’s themes of memory and tradition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the whistle), but emotional impact is muted by abstract phrasing and a lack of grounded conflict or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some metaphors are evocative, but others verge on cliché or vagueness; the writing occasionally slips into generic sentimentality and lacks a distinct stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its emotional resonance and originality are limited by a reliance on familiar tropes and a lack of narrative surprise.</comment>
