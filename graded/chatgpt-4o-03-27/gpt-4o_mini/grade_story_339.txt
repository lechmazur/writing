<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict is clearly portrayed, and her emotional arc is believable, but her transformation feels slightly rushed and lacks deeper complexity or contradiction that would elevate her character to literary excellence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with a satisfying emotional payoff, though the pacing is slightly uneven and the climax (throwing the knob) feels a bit too symbolic without enough buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details and symbolic resonance, though the “prismatic lake” and “construction” could be more tightly integrated into the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, particularly with the drawer knob and the seesaw, though the story leans slightly on telling rather than showing in key emotional moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some metaphors verge on the familiar, and the emotional beats are occasionally too direct, but the story avoids major clichés and shows a mostly original voice with thoughtful imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a clear theme and satisfying resolution, though it stops short of true literary distinction due to some predictable elements and lack of deeper ambiguity.</comment>
