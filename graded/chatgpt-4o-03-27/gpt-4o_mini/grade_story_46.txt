<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The performer is intriguing but underdeveloped; their motivations are poetic yet vague, and their transformation lacks emotional grounding or clear internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a dreamlike arc with a beginning, middle, and end, but the logic of progression is more symbolic than causal, which weakens narrative coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, with creative ambition, but it leans too heavily on atmosphere at the expense of character depth and narrative clarity.</comment>
