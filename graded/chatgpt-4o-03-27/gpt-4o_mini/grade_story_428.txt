<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus has a clear arc and internal conflict, but his transformation feels rushed and his voice lacks distinctiveness; motivations are present but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot has a beginning, middle, and end, and the handshake provides a structural anchor, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the resolution feels too convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Solid cohesion and thematic unity, but the story doesnâ€™t fully transcend its premise or leave a lasting emotional impression; competent but not exceptional.</comment>
