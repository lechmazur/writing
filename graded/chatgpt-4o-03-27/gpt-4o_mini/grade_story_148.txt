<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are clear and emotionally resonant, but her internal conflict around being “eagerly unwilling” is underexplored and lacks complexity; her voice is distinct but not deeply individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc and logical progression, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; however, the pacing is slightly uneven, and the climax feels somewhat rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some phrasing leans toward the generic or overly poetic, and the emotional beats occasionally feel stated rather than shown, but the story avoids major clichés and shows originality in concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with thoughtful integration of elements and a lingering thematic impact, though it stops short of being truly revelatory.</comment>
