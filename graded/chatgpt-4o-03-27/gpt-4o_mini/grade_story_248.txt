<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The character's motivation is clear and consistent, but his personality lacks depth and specificity; "unsteady" and "coyly furious" are not fully realized in action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven, and the central action (reassembling letters) feels underdeveloped as a plot-driving mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and mood, though the connection between setting and object could be more organically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and theme, but emotional resonance is muted by abstract language and lack of grounded, specific moments; the ending is conceptually satisfying but not deeply moving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and ideas, but the prose occasionally veers into generic or overly ornate phrasing; emotional nuance is often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with creative ambition, but lacks the polish and emotional precision required for top-tier publication.</comment>
