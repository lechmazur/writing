<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is clearly motivated and her internal journey is coherent, but her personality lacks depth beyond the reflective scholar archetype; her voice is subdued and not particularly distinctive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the climax lacks narrative tension; the plot leans heavily on introspection over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric with strong sensory detail; the haunted lighthouse is evocative and thematically resonant, enhancing the mood and characterâ€™s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (crossword, light), and the emotional arc is satisfying, but the story leans toward telling over showing in key moments, limiting its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels overly polished or generic, and the emotional beats are occasionally too on-the-nose; lacks the unpredictability or nuance of truly original fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Well-crafted and thematically cohesive, but not quite transcendent; the story is thoughtful and complete, yet plays it safe in structure and emotional risk.</comment>
