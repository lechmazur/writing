<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her emotional arc is believable, but her personality lacks distinctiveness beyond her role as a seeker of legacy—her voice feels subdued and could be more vivid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with strong cause-effect logic; however, the pacing is slightly uneven, and the climax (discovery of the book) feels a bit too convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted amusement park is richly atmospheric, with strong sensory detail and symbolic resonance that enhances the theme of faded grandeur and buried legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses metaphor effectively (e.g., rusted coaster as lineage), but the prose occasionally leans toward telling rather than showing, and the theme could be more subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh and evocative, but others verge on cliché; the story avoids formulaic structure but occasionally lapses into overly poetic phrasing that feels generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a satisfying arc and thoughtful integration of elements, though it stops short of being truly unforgettable or stylistically daring.</comment>
