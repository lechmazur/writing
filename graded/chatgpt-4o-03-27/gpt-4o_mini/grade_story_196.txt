<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The character's emotional arc is clear and consistent, with a believable internal struggle and a subtle but effective transformation; however, his voice lacks distinctiveness and some emotional beats feel overly familiar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution within the word limit, with logical cause-effect progression; however, the pacing is slightly uneven, and the transition from despair to resolve feels a bit abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory cues like the scent of stale tea and meteor showers, but the floating rock monastery is underutilized and could be more integrated into the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., meteor showers, the bag), but it leans on familiar tropes and lacks a truly unique or surprising narrative turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the prose avoids overt clichés and maintains a consistent tone, some phrasing feels generic or overly polished, and the emotional beats follow a predictable pattern without much subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a clear theme and satisfying arc, but it doesn’t quite reach the level of originality or stylistic distinction expected for top-tier publication.</comment>
