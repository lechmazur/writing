<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict and emotional arc are clear, but her motivations and personality traits—especially her secretiveness and philosophical shallowness—are more told than shown, limiting depth and nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing is uneven and the climax lacks tension; the action of “taming” is metaphorical and underdeveloped as a plot driver.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative in concept but underutilized; the extraterrestrial embassy feels like a decorative backdrop rather than an integrated world, and sensory detail is sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the washcloth), but it leans heavily on exposition and abstract language, weakening its impact and emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some metaphors are fresh, but the prose occasionally veers into generic or overly ornate territory; emotional beats are often stated rather than shown, and the tone lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but the execution feels safe and lacks the originality or stylistic precision required for top-tier publication.</comment>
