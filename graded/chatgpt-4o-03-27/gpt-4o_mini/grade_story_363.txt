<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with clear grief-driven motivation; his emotional arc is consistent and compelling, though his "passionate indifference" is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional resolution, but the pacing slightly lags in the middle, and the vote moment feels a bit abrupt in its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory detail—smoke, wood, silence—and the setting enhances the mood of mourning and reflection effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolism (the bell), with layered themes of memory and progress; some metaphors verge on the familiar but are mostly effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Emotion is nuanced and mostly shown, but a few phrases feel slightly generic or overly polished; overall, the story avoids cliché and shows authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Well-crafted and emotionally resonant, with a satisfying arc and thematic depth; not flawless, but close to publishable in a top-tier venue.</comment>
