<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The traveler’s transformation from aimless to purposeful is clear, but their internal voice lacks distinctiveness and emotional nuance, making the character feel more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the transition from archive to community action feels slightly abrupt and idealized, weakening narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory detail—dust, snow, spices—but the archive setting feels underutilized beyond mood-setting and could be more integral to the plot.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels overly polished or generic, and while the story avoids clichés, it leans on familiar emotional arcs without much subversion or surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but lacks the complexity or stylistic daring expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
