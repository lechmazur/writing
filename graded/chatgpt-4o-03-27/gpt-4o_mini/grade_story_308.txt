<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict is well-drawn and her transformation is emotionally resonant, but her role as an “executioner” is underexplored and feels metaphorical rather than literal, weakening the clarity of her motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying resolution, but the transition from anxiety to catharsis is slightly rushed and lacks a strong external catalyst beyond internal resolve.</comment>
