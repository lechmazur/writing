<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Celeste is distinct and her motivations are clear, but her internal conflict is more told than shown; her emotional arc could be deepened through more active choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and resolution, but the pacing is slightly static; the action of painting doesn't fully drive the plot forward, making the middle feel repetitive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory detail—paint, memory, and legacy blend well—but the setting of the social network archive is underutilized and abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and emotional resonance, but the story leans on exposition rather than dramatized moments; more showing would elevate the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors and a unique premise, but the prose occasionally veers into generic sentiment and lacks the unpredictability of truly original fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Well-integrated elements and a satisfying emotional arc, but the story feels more like a vignette than a fully realized narrative; lacks a moment of true narrative tension.</comment>
