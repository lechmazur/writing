<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is a compelling character with a clear motivation and emotional depth, but her "anxiously fearless" trait is more told than shown, and her voice lacks distinctiveness beyond archetypal AI caretaker tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the method of resolving the crisis is somewhat convenient.</comment>
