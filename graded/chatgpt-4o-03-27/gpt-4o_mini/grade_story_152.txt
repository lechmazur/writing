<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias has a clear emotional arc and motivation, but his personality lacks depth beyond symbolic gestures; his voice is poetic but not distinctively individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the transition from solitude to community feels slightly rushed and idealized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Well-crafted and emotionally satisfying, but not yet at the level of literary distinction due to some thematic and stylistic imprecision.</comment>
