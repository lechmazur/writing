<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The character has a clear emotional arc and symbolic actions, but his "dry wit" is not demonstrated, and his motivation to learn traditional methods is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the pacing is slightly uneven and the action of "confiscating" is metaphorical rather than plot-driving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with strong sensory detail and emotional tone; the haunted lighthouse setting enhances the mood and theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism, especially with the rope and lighthouse; emotional resonance is present, though the conflict is more internal than dynamic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and emotional nuance, but a few phrases verge on generic or overly poetic; the dance element feels tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Well-crafted and emotionally resonant, but not quite at the level of top-tier literary fiction due to minor inconsistencies in tone and underused elements.</comment>
