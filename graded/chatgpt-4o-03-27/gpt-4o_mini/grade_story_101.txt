<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arthur is moderately well-developed, with a clear arc from introspection to transformation, but his motivations and emotional shifts feel slightly underexplored and too conveniently resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and satisfying resolution, but the parade as a plot device feels abrupt and under-integrated, making the transition from studio to street slightly jarring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sensory details of the studio and parade are vivid and immersive, effectively contrasting internal and external worlds, though the setting's deeper symbolic potential is only lightly touched.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism (bee pin, parade) effectively, but lacks a truly memorable or surprising insight; the theme is clear but not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some phrasing feels slightly generic or overly polished, and the emotional beats are somewhat predictable; the story avoids clichés but doesn’t fully subvert them either.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, with a clear emotional arc, but lacks the depth or originality to elevate it to top-tier literary excellence.</comment>
