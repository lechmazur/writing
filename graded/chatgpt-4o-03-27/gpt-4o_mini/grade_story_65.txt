<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation is clear and emotionally grounded, but her characterization as a "slapdash bard" is underdeveloped—her actions and voice lack the chaotic or improvisational flair implied by that descriptor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, with the curse and its unraveling providing structure, but some transitions feel overly smooth or convenient, reducing tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and well-integrated with the plot and mood; sensory details and atmosphere are strong, though the tectonic plate edge could be more uniquely leveraged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story evokes emotion and uses symbolism effectively (e.g., the doorplate), but some metaphors verge on cliché and the resolution feels slightly too neat for the tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids overt clichés and has moments of originality, some phrasing feels generic or overly polished, and the emotional beats are occasionally too on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, with a satisfying arc, but lacks the stylistic daring or thematic depth expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
