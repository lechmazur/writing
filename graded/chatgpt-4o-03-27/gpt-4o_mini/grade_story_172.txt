<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict is clear and her motivation—escaping a prophecy—is consistent, but her emotional arc feels overly summarized rather than deeply explored; her transformation lacks the psychological depth expected at this level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the pacing feels slightly rushed in the final third, and the transition from puzzle-solving to metaphysical revelation is abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but its emotional and conceptual depth is limited by surface-level introspection and a reliance on mystical resolution over earned transformation.</comment>
