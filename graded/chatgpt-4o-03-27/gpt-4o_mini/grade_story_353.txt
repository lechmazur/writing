<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her “cynically gentle” nature is underdeveloped—her cynicism is barely evident, making her emotional complexity feel thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot has a satisfying arc and resolution, but the time travel mechanism and rebellion unfold too smoothly, lacking tension or complication that would deepen narrative stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some metaphors and phrasing verge on generic or overly poetic, and the narrative occasionally feels like it’s following a familiar AI-generated structure rather than a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and imaginative, with a strong emotional core, but lacks the narrative complexity and stylistic precision expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
