<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Felix's arc from deception to vulnerability is clear, but his transformation feels rushed and underdeveloped; Mira is more symbol than character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story has a discernible arc and resolution, but the climax (computer reboot) feels arbitrary and under-integrated into the emotional journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Well-crafted and thematically cohesive, but lacks the depth, surprise, or stylistic precision to elevate it to top-tier literary quality.</comment>
