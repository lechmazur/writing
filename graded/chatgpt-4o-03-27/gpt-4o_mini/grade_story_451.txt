<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and emotionally grounded, but her hiring of actors is underdeveloped and never meaningfully impacts the story, weakening the depth of her character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from the farmers market to the mountain feels abrupt, and the actor subplot is dropped without payoff, slightly disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The mountain setting and mysterious tone are evocative, but sensory detail is sparse and the farmers market feels disconnected from the rest of the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story evokes curiosity and uses symbolism effectively (the baseball), but emotional beats are often told rather than shown, and the dialogue lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in concept, but the execution leans on familiar tropes (mysterious stranger, prophecy, visions) without subversion or fresh insight; language occasionally veers into generic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically consistent, but lacks the stylistic precision and emotional complexity expected at the highest literary level.</comment>
