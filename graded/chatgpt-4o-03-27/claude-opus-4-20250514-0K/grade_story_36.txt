<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ezra is rendered with a compelling internal logic—his calm demeanor, prophetic vision, and workshop rituals cohere into a deeply felt character arc with unique voice and symbolic consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc in limited space, with the backward-beating heart and skateboard altar tying structure and closure, though the plot develops more atmospherically than causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original blend of skater-punk and prophetic steampunk; metaphors are vivid, emotion subtle but resonant; no plot clichés or AI fallback structures evident.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story coalesces beautifully—its elements serve a unified aesthetic and emotional goal, leaving a lingering impression of quiet defiance against cosmic decay.</comment>
