<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The apprentice has a clear motivation and her actions align with her character traits, particularly her literal interpretation of the maps, but there’s minimal emotional depth or internal conflict that would enrich her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is tight and coherent with a clear resolution; the cause-effect logic of the overcharge and ghost communications is strong, though some narrative leaps (e.g., how the key enables decoding) feel slightly handwaved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is highly evocative, integrating atmosphere and post-apocalyptic elements seamlessly; the sensory detail and tone enhance mood and narrative stakes powerfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The layering of ghost-tech, water scarcity, and astronomical legacy creates a memorable, thematically rich story; the prose is confident, but more emotional texture or ambiguity could deepen the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original premise with strong fusion of speculative tech and haunting imagery; storytelling avoids clichés and presents a fresh narrative architecture, though occasional overly formal language slightly detracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive and cohesive with all elements serving a central theme; the story lingers with a sense of promise and mystery, though emotional stakes could be sharpened further to elevate its lasting resonance.</comment>
