<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara is a nuanced, emotionally complex character whose loyalty and internal conflict are clearly conveyed through both action and symbolic interaction with the journal; her motivations, especially the tension between duty and trauma, are consistent and compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Despite a compressed space, the story presents a clear arc—emotional descent, revelation, decision—though the pacing slightly lags at the midpoint; the logic of coded broadcasts and her counter-action is mostly tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is deeply immersive, with evocative sensory detail (moths, flickering lights, static) that supports the story's tone and setting; the tower's history adds resonance and metaphorical depth to the protagonist’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story layers metaphor, subtext, and internal conflict with striking dexterity; symbolism (moths, light, storms) is potent, and the story invites reflection, though the ending could deepen its emotional resonance further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Refreshingly original in combining espionage with atmospheric introspection; some lines veer toward lightly ornate or familiar phrasing, but overall the metaphorical framework and tone feel distinct and controlled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story feels intentionally crafted rather than constrained by prompts; its mood, structure, and metaphorical continuity offer a satisfying, thoughtful whole that lingers beyond the final line.</comment>
