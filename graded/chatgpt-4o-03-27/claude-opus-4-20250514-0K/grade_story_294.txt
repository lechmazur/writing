<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bard's arc is well-developed and emotionally satisfying; her motivations—to preserve herself and escape inner imprisonment—are consistent and resonate strongly, though her "voice" could be slightly more distinct early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure offers a coherent emotional journey with strong cause and effect, though the climax arrives quickly and the voicemails' narrative function feels underutilized relative to their symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original takes on familiar metaphors and an emotionally nuanced premise lift the story above formula, though minor instances of poetic overreach hint at stylization over substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive and emotionally resonant given the constraints; all elements contribute meaningfully, though a tighter integration of the voicemail method would deepen impact.</comment>
