<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus is multidimensional: his sober past, guilt, and cardsharp intuition create a believable, compelling inner conflict that drives the plot and thematically links to his actions in the climax. His motivations are clear and consistent, though his voice, while textured, could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a compelling arc—setup, mystery, climax, and resolution—all within the word limit. The final choice is surprising yet earned, though some transitions feel slightly telescoped due to spatial constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and tonally cohesive; the mist-shrouded island and antique lighthouse enhance the story’s somber mood and supernatural tension. Sensory detail is deftly used without overindulgence, creating a vivid, haunting setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful symbolism (ink well, evaporating regrets), emotionally resonant imagery, and a thematic throughline of redemption and integrity elevate this story. The final paragraph elegantly resolves tension and deepens impact without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptionally fresh approach with careful avoidance of cliché. The ink well metaphor and Marcus’s ability are imaginative. A few turns of phrase ("boisterously quiet") edge toward ornate, but overall the voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A sophisticated blend of elements supporting a resonant, cohesive story. Despite tight length, the narrative offers thematic depth, emotional payoff, and memorable imagery. One of the rare examples where all pieces serve the whole.</comment>
