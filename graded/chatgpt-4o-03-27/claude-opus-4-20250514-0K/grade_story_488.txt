<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The summoner’s motivations are clearly anchored in grief, legacy, and transcendence; her arc is subtle but coherent. However, emotional nuance and individual personality are somewhat abstracted behind metaphor-heavy prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s arc is tightly constructed with a clear climax and resolution. The pacing is brisk but efficient, and the collapsing lighthouse as both event and metaphor serves as an effective anchor for the structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and vividly realized; the "quantum beach" and decomposing "Probability Lighthouse" evoke a unique collision of decay and invention. Excellent sensory and conceptual integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story has strong symbolic layering and effective stylistic choices. It evokes curiosity and metaphysical awe, though dialogue/micro-interaction is entirely absent, limiting emotional intimacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imagery is original and purposeful with minimal reliance on clichés. Some phrases risk veering into overwrought territory, but overall execution shows care and refinement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and conceptually rich. The story lingers in the mind and makes effective, creative use of assigned elements without feeling mechanistic.</comment>
