<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera and Jin are distinct, motivated, and consistent, with Veraâ€™s cap and resolve tying her character arc together; emotional resonance is strong but not deeply transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative has a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; pacing is strong, but the central conflict with the cave's resistance could use more escalation for higher stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is vividly rendered with sensory detail and mood; setting and atmosphere strongly support theme and character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant prose, meaningful symbolism (the cap, the sound of resolve), and a satisfying arc; not deeply subversive, but quietly powerful and thematically cohesive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blends necromancy, quantum physics, classic film nostalgia, and exploration in an original, humanized way; metaphors mostly fresh, though a few tropes tread familiar ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, emotionally resonant, and creatively structured; feels purposeful rather than constrained, with distinct voice and thematic clarity.</comment>
