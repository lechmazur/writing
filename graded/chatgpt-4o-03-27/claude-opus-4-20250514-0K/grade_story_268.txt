<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus is a well-drawn, emotionally complex character whose motivations are consistent and deeply entwined with his past; the bead and his restraint from violence showcase layered growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story develops a clear arc from concealment to confrontation, effectively using its limited space, though the transition from therapy session to vigilante justice feels slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotionally and structurally cohesive; each element serves the narrative, and the piece lingers due to its atmospheric weight and moral ambiguity.</comment>
