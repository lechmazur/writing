<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is richly drawn, with her malaise, disillusionment, and muted epiphany tightly interwoven; her trajectory from analysis-driven numbness to emotional reawakening is subtle yet believable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc unfolds with quiet cohesion, using symbolic gestures (e.g., working the bellows, scattering notes) to resolve internal conflict, though some transitions feel introspective to the point of stasis.</comment>
