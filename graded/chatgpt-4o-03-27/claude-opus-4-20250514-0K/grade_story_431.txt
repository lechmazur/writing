<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s introversion and background as a dancer are consistently reflected in her precise, contemplative actions and her way of interpreting celestial patterns through movement; her motivation to escape is clear and her mental journey feels authentic, though slightly more depth could elevate her transformation further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a well-paced arc, skillfully connecting the beginning’s despair to the ending’s transcendence; the knitting-as-decoding method is unusual yet coherent, and the decoder’s vanished presence supports the narrative without overt exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with strong sensory details—dust, static, silence—and the setting supports tone and theme effectively; the desolate office and its contrast with celestial escape are both literal and symbolic backdrops enhancing mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Impressive use of metaphor (dance as cosmic reading), layered subtext, and poetic prose; the story emotionally resonates, with its ending delivering both closure and transcendental suggestion; minor over-description slightly blunts impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution—blending knitting, astronomy, and internal transformation; emotional nuance and fresh metaphors offset occasional slips into poetic excess or slightly too-polished structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Remarkably cohesive and thematically rich; elements interlock with grace and subtlety, though one or two connections (e.g., echoes) feel less integrated; still, an impressive, publish-worthy effort.</comment>
