<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marlow’s motivations are clear and evolve organically; the discovery of his heritage aligns well with his actions, though his voice remains more reflective than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story delivers a full arc—discovery, realization, inheritance—efficiently within its constraints, though transitions between memory and revelation could be slightly more seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The surreal yet grounded setting is richly immersive—Magnetic Mountain and the flickering projector amplify the mystical atmosphere and thematic resonance beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive symbolism (the spoon as conduit of inheritance and chaos), emotional payoff, and clear thematic depth elevate the narrative craft substantially; minor tonal repetition costs it perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong originality in concept and metaphor (chaotic cooking lineage); some metaphors verge on overuse but overall avoids cliché and demonstrates notable narrative ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with memorable imagery and resonant theme; style serves clarity and mood, while the narrative lingers meaningfully despite one or two overly ornate phrases.</comment>
