<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's character is sharply drawn, with clear motivations rooted in personal loss and resistance to a deterministic world. Her emotional connection to the buckle and consistency of purpose give her depth, although more layers or complexity could elevate her further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a compact but complete narrative arc with strong internal logic. The midnight ritual structure is effective, though the climax and resolution feel more reflective than dramatically impactful, slightly limiting narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The world is richly atmospheric—neon, dust, and fading tech form a strong sensory backdrop. The planetarium and post-storytelling era are evocative, though a touch more sensory variety could further deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is poetic and controlled, with strong symbolic and emotional undercurrents. The central metaphor of rewriting fate is compelling, though the emotional tension could be heightened for even greater resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and human nuance show originality, and the story avoids cliché. Some phrasing veers close to the overly ornate, but overall, the narrative style and concept feel distinctively authorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An emotionally and conceptually cohesive piece that lingers after reading. The assigned elements are well-integrated, and the writing is confident and purposeful, though perhaps just shy of being truly transcendent.</comment>
