<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—to recover her lost muse—is clear and emotionally resonant. Her actions follow logically from her desperation, and the final epiphany aligns with her growth. However, her emotional transition feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through internal struggle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor and symbolism; the seed as artistic rebirth is especially strong. The story balances emotional impact with subtext, though the mentor figure’s explanation slightly veers toward exposition rather than revelation.</comment>
