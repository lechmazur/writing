<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus is effectively drawn with layered complexity: his clerical restraint, secret dance partnership, and scientific curiosity all align with his motivations and internal conflict, though Eliza is slightly more archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative is tightly structured with a clear arc—set-up, mystery, stakes, and a pivot toward resolution, all within the constraint. Cause and effect are coherent, though the ending lightly leans on exposition over dramatization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hints of the setting (Vatican taboos, psychic research facility, séance-era postcard) establish mood well, but sensory immersion is limited—more atmospheric texture would elevate impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong subtext around duality (faith/science, concealment/revelation) and elegant metaphorical resonance (dance as psychological exposure); however, the final line is slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise is refreshingly original with clever genre-blending; character motivations feel nuanced, and tropes are meaningfully subverted. Slightly stylized dialogue could be more varied rhythmically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story demonstrates a cohesive, high-concept vision executed with clarity and flair—balancing complexity with brevity. It lingers just enough to provoke reflection on identity and synthesis.</comment>
