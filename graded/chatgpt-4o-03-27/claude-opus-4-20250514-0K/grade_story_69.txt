<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thorne’s uncertainty is nuanced and consistent, his motivations evolve organically, and his transformation is emotionally resonant; a distinct internal arc is present without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story delivers a full narrative arc with elegant pacing and logical progression; however, the transition to community transformation at the end feels slightly rushed given the word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail and metaphor, blending the decayed and digital atmospheres into a compelling, immersive world that supports the story’s themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Excellent use of subtext, metaphor, and theme—particularly the notion of transformation through brokenness; the emotional undercurrent is subtle but powerful, and the final image lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original fusion of fantasy and cyberpunk; metaphors feel intentional and fresh, though a few moments veer close to poetic excess that slightly distract from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, thought-provoking fable with strong artistic merit and emotional depth; it feels deliberately shaped rather than constrained, though one more beat of emotional confrontation would elevate it further.</comment>
