<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is well-developed within word limits; his motivations—loss, pride, desperation—are clearly tied to his past and actions, though interiority could be deepened slightly for full emotional immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete with a clear arc, smooth pacing, and logical cause-effect progression; minor implausibility in circumventing security is offset by the compelling thematic journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich, immersive, and tonally matched; sensory details and setting powerfully support mood and theme, though the facility could benefit from one more tactile detail to ground it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally charged and symbolically resonant; excellent use of metaphor and subtext elevates storytelling, though one or two transitions verge on overly poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nearly all elements feel fresh and well-integrated with specific, vivid language; minimal signs of formulaic or AI-generated structure, though tonal phrasing flirts with excess in rare moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Extremely cohesive and thoughtfully constructed; assigned elements feel organic to the story’s emotional arc and the ending lingers with philosophical weight.</comment>
