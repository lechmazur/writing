<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s transformation is well-rendered and emotionally authentic, with his motivations and internal contradictions gradually revealed through forced truth-telling; however, his initial cynicism could be more sharply individualized to deepen contrast with his arc.</comment>
