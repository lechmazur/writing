<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus is vividly drawn through action, voice, and internal logic; his pessimism and tradesman past inform every decision and reflection, though Sarah as a motivating presence could be fleshed out slightly more to enhance stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent structure within the word limit—strong beginning, middle, and end with clear stakes tied to the windmill; the vectorization and its consequences unfold smoothly and with high internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The surreal, decaying world is powerfully realized with rich sensory details—pulsing mushroom walls, poisoned earth, and flickering candlelight all contribute to atmosphere and theme cohesively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The thematic depth—memory, loss, love—resonates through layered metaphors; poetic style avoids excess, though a bit more character tension during vectorization could heighten emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original with vivid metaphors and nuanced emotional tone; a few slightly familiar post-apocalyptic details prevent it from reaching full uniqueness, but the philosophical ambition is impressive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally resonant; the elements integrate organically into a story that feels complete and lingers well past the final sentence.</comment>
