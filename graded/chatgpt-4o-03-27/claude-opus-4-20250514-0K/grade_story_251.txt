<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira is distinctively portrayed with a strong internal conflict; her motivations align with her cosmic awareness and reluctance. Chen adds dimension, serving as a foil, though his development remains shallow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot is conceptually coherent and has a discernible arc, but the abstract nature and metaphysical scope slightly blur causality and resolution clarity within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of Lunar Station Seven is vividly fused with philosophical and sci-fi elements, enhancing mood and theme through specific visual and conceptual detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A rich, thought-provoking piece that integrates philosophical depth with sci-fi elements; tight but resonant, though abstract density may challenge accessibility.</comment>
