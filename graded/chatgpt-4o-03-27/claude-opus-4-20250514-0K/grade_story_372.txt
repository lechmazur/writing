<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivations are largely clear and consistent, especially her emotional drive related to Marcus, but her emotional indifference sometimes feels underexplored or too convenient for narrative needs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A compelling narrative with atmospheric depth and thematic cohesion; strong stylistic choices elevate the story, though some transitions verge on opaque.</comment>
