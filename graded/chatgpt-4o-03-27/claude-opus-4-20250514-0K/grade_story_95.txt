<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is a distinctive and compelling figure; his motivations and internal logic are clear and rooted in his eccentric reverence for storm-lore and linguistic mysticism, though minor refinement in emotional depth or arc could elevate him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story maintains coherence with a wholly original concept arc, yet its lack of escalating stakes or resolution creates a lingering sense of structural incompleteness within its evocative frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and consistently poetic, with the monastery-turned-storm-lab a brilliant fusion of setting and theme; sensory detail is elegant and supports the tone seamlessly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©s and formula entirely, delivering an unusually original tone and angle; imagery feels specific and human, though the language occasionally flirts with overwriting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically resonant, with a strong aftertaste of wonder and melancholy; refinement in narrative tension and emotional climax could strengthen publishability.</comment>
