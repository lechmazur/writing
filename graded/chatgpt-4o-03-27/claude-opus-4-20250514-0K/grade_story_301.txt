<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc within the word limit, transitioning effectively from discovery to climactic decision; some causal leaps (e.g., the cult's mechanics) could use clearer grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Jazz Age setting, rich in sensory detail and eerie atmosphere, harmonizes with the occult themes; the story skillfully evokes mood through sound and texture, especially the jazz motifs and time-leak effects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery, strong metaphorical layering, and a haunting tone foster emotional and philosophical resonance; the ending is thematically powerful though slightly predictable for cosmic horror aficionados.</comment>
