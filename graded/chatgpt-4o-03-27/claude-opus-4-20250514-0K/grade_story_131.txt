<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s emotional arc is authentic and well-paced; her transformation from detached orphan to purposeful inheritor feels earned, though slightly more nuance in voice or internal monologue would elevate the character further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, with the anomaly and stones logically driving the action; pacing is strong, though transitions between memories and action could be marginally sharper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and tactile, with gravity disruption vividly rendered; sensory detail is effective and consistent, particularly in evoking the surreal disintegration of space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotional resonance and symbolic richness (stones as memory, transformation, inheritance) are potent; strong thematic cohesion, though closing lines verge slightly on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Language is original and metaphorically fresh; a few phrases risk veering into poetic excess, but overall, the story avoids cliché and shows genuine authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong fusion of theme, tone, and elements; narrative feels complete within constraints and leaves a lasting impression—though minimal dialogue and high introspection slightly narrow its range.</comment>
