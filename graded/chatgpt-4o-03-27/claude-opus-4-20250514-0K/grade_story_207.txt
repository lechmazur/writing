<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Petra’s characterization as forthright and bound by a blood oath is compelling and consistent, with clear motivation and emotional stakes; however, Marcus feels less fully realized beyond his guilt and need for redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc, emotional climax, and resolution within a tight word count; minor leaps in background logic (e.g., finding Marcus via gossip) slightly strain credulity but don't disrupt flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly drawn, with vivid sensory detail and strong use of the abandoned medical bay to enhance mood and reinforce themes of isolation and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant, well-paced, and thematically layered; literary devices are used effectively, particularly through symbolism (flowers, silence, decay), though the dialogue edges toward melodrama at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and uses fresh imagery, though some lines flirt with over-formality; speech patterns and narrative tone are mostly human and unique but occasionally drift toward poetic generalization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Well-executed and cohesive with strong thematic unity; the story feels reflective and complete, though a bit more character complexity would elevate it to elite literary standards.</comment>
