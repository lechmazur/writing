<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zara is well-developed through her tactile interactions, secrecy, and recognition of artisan cues; her motivations align smoothly with her craft and actions. Marcus is less fully fleshed but serviceable within the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot unfolds clearly and satisfies within the tight word count—Zara's search, discovery, and emotional/functional resolution are efficiently handled. A slight lull before Marcus appears, but momentum recovers quickly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting is rich and immersive; sensory detail—saffron, cardamom, marigold—is vivid and enhances mood. The atmosphere supports the themes of revival and hidden treasures exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is high, themes of preservation and rediscovery are poignantly handled. Symbolism (pressed marigold, ravens, crayon) adds depth. Ending is satisfying and subtly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and well-integrated object usage elevate the story beyond formula. A few moments veer toward the slightly ornate but largely restrained and purposeful styling prevails.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion of elements; each chosen device serves the plot or theme skillfully. Thoughtfully layered, emotionally rich, and unique in concept-to-execution mapping.</comment>
