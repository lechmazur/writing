<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’ internal conflict is vividly rendered, and his arc from disillusionment to transformative faith is emotionally and thematically coherent; his motivation develops naturally from doubt, though the shift could be deepened with more external conflict or moral stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure moves with poetic clarity from despair to reconnection, but the climax—decoding the final sequence—feels slightly rushed; still, the arc is strong, compact, and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass desert and echoing piano are hauntingly described with multisensory richness, reinforcing tone and theme; the setting is integral, though a bit more specific cultural or historical context would enhance immersion further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotionally evocative with layered symbols (fork, piano, butterfly), this story wields its literary devices with restraint and elegance; the subtext around faith and transformation is mature and compelling, though the ending skirts sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative avoids clichés, uses metaphors with originality, and shows emotional nuance; some phrasing occasionally veers toward stylized abstraction, slightly undermining clarity, but the voice remains distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A compelling fusion of atmosphere, metaphor, and character, the story feels expansive despite brevity; a standout reflection on doubt-as-faith, though one or two transitions could be more grounded.</comment>
