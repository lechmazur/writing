<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus is a well-drawn character with clear motivation rooted in grief and justice; his actions logically stem from his traits, though Helena’s arc remains underdeveloped in comparison.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is efficient and tightly woven within the constraints, with clear cause-effect progressions; the narrative arc closes cleanly, though a slightly more surprising twist could elevate the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., peacock patterns, wax seal), with layered subtext about surveillance and grief; dialogue reveals character effectively and tone is well-managed.</comment>
