<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zara’s motivations are consistent and layered, clearly driven by survival, heritage, and rebellion, and her use of the dice illustrates both her abilities and philosophical stance; however, secondary characters like Koji remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong and complete within the word count, with cause-effect logic tying the dice to navigation and language decoding; minor pacing issues in the climax slightly rushed the payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels complete and emotionally resonant, balancing speculative depth with poetic flair; it lingers in the mind with its fusion of myth, rebellion, and linguistic archaeology.</comment>
