<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolic layering (e.g., the stripped screw as both flaw and test) enrich the narrative; the story subtly evokes awe and responsibility, though a slightly more surprising emotional beat in the climax would make it unforgettable.</comment>
