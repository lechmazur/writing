<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The undertaker is vividly characterized through his actions, lineage, and emotional arc; his stoicism, sense of duty, and exhaustion feel authentic, although dialogue or internal monologue would deepen his voice further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc with a strong beginning, rising tension, and a mystical resolution; pacing is well-managed and cause-effect logic is sound, though the climax could be slightly more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured—dusty tiles, failing refrigeration units, flickering candlelight—used to heighten mood and reinforce the setting’s decay and sacredness; sensory immersion is excellent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and elegant prose elevate the craft; the ticking clock as heartbeat and cosmic order as salvation resonate deeply, though the emotional payoff could be sharpened with slightly more tension or uncertainty before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids clichés; metaphors are fresh, and tone consistent; the ancient-modern synthesis feels original and purposeful, with human nuance emerging organically from the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Balances scope, voice, and resonance beautifully; doesn’t feel constrained by length, and concept execution is emotionally and intellectually satisfying with impressive cohesion among elements.</comment>
