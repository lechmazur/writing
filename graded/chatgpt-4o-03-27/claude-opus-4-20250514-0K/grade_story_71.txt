<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scarecrow's emotionless, duty-bound character is consistent and intriguing, though internal conflict or dimensional nuance could elevate depth further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative maintains internal logic and a clear arc within the word limit, but repetition of structure (approach, skewering, return to vigil) risks predictability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, strange, and powerfully integrated into tone and atmosphere; sensory and metaphysical descriptions ground the abstract well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and language; emotional detachment is intentional but limits resonance. Symbolism is rich, but narrative tension could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept and imagery are highly original; language avoids clich√©s and builds a haunting tone. A few phrases nearly verge on overwriting but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Impressively cohesive for the word count; the elements serve the narrative rather than dominate it. Leaves a lingering, unsettling impression with thematic weight.</comment>
