<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus is a vivid, complex character whose transformation from enforcer to philosopher-pugilist is compelling and consistent; his motivations and inner voice are clearly rendered through action and reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Despite the short form, the story has a clear arc—setback, reflection, forward motion—and uses its action (the flat tire) meaningfully; could benefit from slightly more narrative tension or conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined and sensory detail is exceptional; the desert, the silo, and even the wind feel alive and thematically resonant with the story’s philosophical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and evocative; metaphors are fresh; the story deeply explores violence as metaphor for inquiry, showing masterful storytelling and thematic layering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is highly original with elegant symbolic use of its elements; emotional nuance is shown rather than told, and nothing feels algorithmic or generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive with all elements working in concert; the brevity feels like a deliberate artistic constraint, and narrative choices reveal great creative control.</comment>
