<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina is rendered with emotional nuance—her bashfulness, inherited duty, and grief create a layered and motivated character; her actions and reactions align closely with her inner world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story forms a complete arc within constraints, with clear build-up to the performance; however, the festival's judicial-religious context could be better clarified for full coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating yoga studio, festival, and harbor tides create an immersive and emotionally resonant atmosphere that complements Marina’s role and inner conflict beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative is emotionally powerful, quiet yet memorable; the use of symbolism (the keychain, the dances) is elegant without overreach, enabling subtext and resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, poetic handling of theme and detail with few clichés; strong restraint in prose avoids formulaic traps, conveying emotion through gesture and movement rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally rich; each element serves theme and mood, and the constraints feel like a conscious artistic frame rather than a limitation.</comment>
