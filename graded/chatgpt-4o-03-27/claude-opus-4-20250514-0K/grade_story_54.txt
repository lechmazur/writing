<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivations are consistent and layered, shaped by familial legacy, personal loss, and rebellion; her restraint around the letter adds depth, though she remains slightly too polished for full psychological realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arc is impressively cohesive for the length, with clear setup, rising tension, and resolution; the celestial timing and tunnel delivery system enhance momentum, though stakes could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
