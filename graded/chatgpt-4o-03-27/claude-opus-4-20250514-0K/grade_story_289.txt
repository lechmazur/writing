<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear and tied closely to her traits as a brainy observer and xenoarchaeologist; her actions feel consistent and grounded in her worldview, though emotional depth is slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves impressive narrative coherence and resolution within word limits; the doll, art method, and alien contact flow logically, though Elara's sudden full understanding of the aliens strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and vividly described; the bioluminescent bay not only provides atmosphere but meaningfully supports theme and character arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (art, light, language, weakness); the ending resolves the thematic arc elegantly, though the “test” concept feels lightly explained and could use more grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Generally fresh and stylistically coherent; some mildly familiar tropes (ancient aliens, evolutionary transcendence) are present but subverted by the focus on impermanence and humility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative, complete, and emotionally resonant; the story successfully weaves its elements into a compelling whole that lingers in thought beyond its word count.</comment>
