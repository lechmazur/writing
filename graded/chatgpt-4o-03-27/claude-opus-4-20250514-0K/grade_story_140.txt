<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marcus’s arc from reluctant guardian to spiritual guide is compelling and emotionally grounded, though the child’s duality could benefit from more development to clarify her motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story maintains an elegant arc with a clear beginning, turning point, and resolution; pacing is masterful considering the word constraint, though transition to supernatural acceptance is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured—ethereal yet grounded; setting details (the mirrors, costumes, city sleep) enhance tension and wonder with outstanding sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant with layered metaphor (scars as constellations), subtextual themes of redemption and liminality are deeply embedded; only minor clichés mar overall storytelling brilliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and evocative tone elevate the narrative, though elements like the flickering-child and circus spirits risk leaning on well-trodden gothic-fantasy tropes without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive and emotionally satisfying tale that feels larger than its length; its themes of purpose and liminality linger meaningfully beyond the page.</comment>
