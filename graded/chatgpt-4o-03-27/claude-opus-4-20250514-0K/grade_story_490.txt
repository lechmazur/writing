<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, layered character; her deterioration and obsession are deeply linked, though some aspects of her motivation (e.g., emotional connection to her grandmother or the desire for transcendence) could be sharpened further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong structure with a satisfying arc; the progression from decay to transcendence is coherent and resonant, though middle pacing slightly flattens before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive atmosphere grounded in sensory detail; the desolate setting and decayed technology enhance the tone and mood organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impactful and layered with elegant symbolism (lavender, memory, decay); ending resonates, though emotional depth feels consciously restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking originality, especially in the synthesis of elements; a few lines verge on overly ornate, and "methodically random" feels under-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive with poetic execution and thematic clarity; the short length enhances rather than limits the story's gravitas and affect.</comment>
