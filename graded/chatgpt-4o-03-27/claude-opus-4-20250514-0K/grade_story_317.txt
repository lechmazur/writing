<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira-7’s motivations—built on memory, programming, and pattern recognition—are well-articulated and emotionally resonant, creating a compelling portrait of an android burdened by human-like conscience; dialogue and internal narration support her distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot has a strong arc with clear stakes and a satisfying resolution; however, the climax arrives a bit too quickly, slightly compressing tension that could have benefited from more buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The levitation facility and crystal cave are vividly imagined with strong sensory detail and atmospheric consistency, enhancing both tone and character motivation in a unique sci-fi setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism and metaphor (e.g., betrayal fizzing like crystals) are effective; emotional and thematic layers are present though some lines verge on overwritten, slightly reducing narrative sharpness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>There is freshness in the android’s perspective and the metaphorical use of crystals, though some tropes (AI guardian, human greed) aren’t wholly subverted; prose avoids formula but flirts with purple at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A polished, evocative piece that weaves its elements purposefully; though highly successful, a touch more restraint in prose and tension calibration would elevate it to elite tier.</comment>
