<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sarah's character is empathetically rendered with a clear emotional arc, and her motivation is organically revealed through repeated trauma—but some transitions between her internal realization and external action feel thematically over-explicit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is coherent and progresses meaningfully from loop to breakthrough, but the loop-breaking mechanism—triggered by a single raindrop—feels somewhat abrupt and underdeveloped within the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly surreal yet emotionally grounded; evocative imagery like "tears falling upward" and the crystalline corridor effectively enhance both mood and metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant, symbolically layered, and thematically cohesive, with deft use of metaphor and a compelling resolution—though it borders on sentimentality in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The writing shows strong originality, especially in metaphor and tone blending, but a few phrases and shifts ("baptizing her nightmares") verge on cliché or overwritten territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This is a poetic, emotionally layered piece that feels whole and impactful; most elements serve the story rather than feeling shoehorned, with a satisfying resolution rooted in character evolution.</comment>
