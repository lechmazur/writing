<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arcturus is vividly drawn with a consistent internal logic, his actions reflecting deep internal conflict; his transformation through the child’s intervention is authentic and moving, though we get little dialogue or interior monologue beyond action-driven cues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arctic greenhouse is a masterful fusion of setting and theme—its unnatural lushness mirroring the story’s emotional thaw; sensory details are vivid and purposeful, and atmosphere supports character motivation effectively.</comment>
