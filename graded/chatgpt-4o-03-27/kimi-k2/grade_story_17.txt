<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt is deeply embedded in every action and object she engages with, from the bowl to her eulogy decoding. Her emotional transformation is subtle but earned, though dialogue is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc—guilt to symbolic redemption—within its constrained space, with each beat flowing logically despite a metaphor-rich style that could verge on overwrought for some readers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and textured—rosemary, steam, runes, and vapor doors offer richly sensory setting that mirrors Mara’s internal journey without excessive exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Symbolism is layered and purposeful, especially the bowl and its transformation. Emotion is shown via action/subtext. Ending is both quiet and potent, though a risk of overwriting lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mostly original in metaphor and structure, though a few phrases flirt with poetic excess. Emotional nuance feels human, and AI tropes are skillfully avoided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and purposeful. All elements are interwoven to support the theme with clear craft and style. A few metaphors may feel slightly forced, but they do not detract significantly.</comment>
