<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cryptic medium is a distinct, well-imagined character with clear, consistent motives and poetic resonance; while she lacks conventional arc or conflict, her myth-seeding presence is evocative and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative unfolds with surreal logic but maintains coherence; the accidental arrival, myth-telling, and legacy-building form a complete arc, though transitions blur cause-effect clarity at times.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and original; metaphors ("copper stars," "lungs soldered with sea") are fresh and striking, though the repetition of lyrical phrasing skirts excess at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A haunting, poetic piece whose layered use of myth, memory, and machine leaves a lingering effect; exceptional in tone and craft though not universally accessible.</comment>
