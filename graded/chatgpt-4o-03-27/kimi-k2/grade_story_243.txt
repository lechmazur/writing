<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>HexaByte's motivation is emotionally resonant and consistent, and her reactions—especially summoning her brother—are poignant; however, more internal complexity or conflicted emotion could elevate her beyond archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc with an effective beginning, middle, and resolution; the action builds logically, though some transitions—especially summoning the ghost and entering the boss chamber—could be more grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exceptional—visually rich, tonally unified, and immersive with vivid sensory metaphors that serve both atmosphere and theme; minor clarity issues in spatial logic prevent a full score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dense symbolism (halo, fishhook, mural) works on multiple levels, and the narrative builds to a satisfying emotional and thematic climax; despite brevity, it evokes meaning and mood well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story mostly avoids clichés, deploying fresh metaphors and imagery with strong stylistic voice; small moments verge on stylistic overreach or overly ornate phrasing but don’t break immersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A strikingly imaginative and complete story within constraints; themes of identity, revisionism, and memory shine through without heavy exposition—distinctive and memorable in concept and execution.</comment>
