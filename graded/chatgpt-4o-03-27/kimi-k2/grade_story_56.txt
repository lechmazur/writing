<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The swindler's arc is surprisingly nuanced given the length constraint—his moral reckoning feels earned, consistent with his deception-fatigued state, and his shift from conman to caretaker is psychologically believable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot flows organically from encounter to confession to transformation, with a strong narrative arc; minor ambiguity in timeframe transitions slightly blurs clarity but doesn't derail coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is vividly imagined and symbolically potent—sensory details like bruised apples and wet concrete deepen mood while the toppled skyscraper-turned-orchard metaphor enhances thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking originality in imagery and concept execution; minor lapses in figurative phrasing subtlety, but overall avoids tropes and flows with an idiosyncratic, poetic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Remains cohesive, layered, and emotionally resonant; the story lingers with moral complexity and stylistic poise that elevates it beyond experimental gimmickry.</comment>
