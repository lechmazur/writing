<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aldric's psychology as a lapsed priest and conflicted seeker is richly rendered via his symbolic actions and inner contradictions, though his arc, while evocative, skirts the edge of clarity in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc effectively mirrors the theme of personal transformation, though some symbolic moments (e.g. the mirror sky) feel slightly abstracted from the emotional stakes of the journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The surreal orchard, sky-labyrinth, and snow-patterned map blend atmosphere and symbolism impeccably, immersing the reader in a liminal, mythic landscape that mirrors Aldric's inner terrain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The symbolism is layered and literary—the abacus, the question mark, the reversed ascension—all used to deepen theme and mood without overt exposition; the lyrical prose enhances rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive imagery and poetic metaphors avoid cliché, though at moments verge on over-stylization; originality of concept and metaphorical depth are exceptional and cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with a strong thematic throughline; despite dense abstraction, it leaves a resonant impression of spiritual reckoning and narrative closure within a compressed word count.</comment>
