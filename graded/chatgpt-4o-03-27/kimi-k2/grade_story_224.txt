<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The minstrel’s characterization is subtle yet effective; his desperation for renewal and privacy is consistently reflected in his actions and internal transformation, though his emotional state could have been further deepened through dialogue or distinct inner voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and well-contained within the space, progressing logically from theft to transformation and resolution; some transitions, particularly from tension to transcendence, could benefit from more narrative scaffolding for peak clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, immersive, and central to the story’s mood—sensorial and symbolic use of the giant’s hall and the meteorite adds rich layers of meaning and supports the surreal tone beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong thematic resonance and layered metaphor; the emotional arc lands gracefully, though the internal conflict might be sharpened slightly for deeper catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Though some phrasings verge on ornate, the language largely avoids cliché and delivers specificity and freshness; the emotional and conceptual nuances feel human and thoughtfully rendered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This is an elegant, complete narrative that rises above its constraints with deliberate pacing and a resonant conclusion; minor moments of abstraction slightly limit full accessibility but not overall impact.</comment>
