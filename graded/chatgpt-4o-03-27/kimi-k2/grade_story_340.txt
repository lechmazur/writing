<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lúcia is vivid and layered—driven, bitter, self-aware. Her pride and desire to escape Aldo’s shadow shape every choice, and her arc from resentment to ownership is convincingly human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story has a tight, satisfying arc. The bridge detour sparks the conflict, the youthify spell escalates it meaningfully, and the return to form resolves both inner and outer tension with cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The vine-laced, suspended Amazonian city is gorgeously realized, immersive, and thematically tied to transience and fragility. Sensory details (dust motes, humidity, rain barrels) deeply enrich atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Wry metaphors, resonant symbols (clock beats, shadow, bridge), and clever dialogue support a layered theme. Emotion, humor, and tension are balanced with literary flair and subtextual richness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids tropes, with fresh imagery and a distinctive tone. The voice is idiosyncratic and human, not mechanical. Details feel precise, not generic. Only minor moments flirt with overwritten whimsy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A remarkably cohesive, stylish, emotionally resonant narrative. Not a word feels wasted; it lingers well beyond its length. The integration of all elements is artful, never contrived.</comment>
