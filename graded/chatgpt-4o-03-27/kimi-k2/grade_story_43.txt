<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The character’s wary, introverted nature is vividly and consistently portrayed through action and sensory detail; her motivation—to reclaim or reunite with her own courage—emerges subtly but clearly, aligning with her behaviors and inner transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure maintains a mystical coherence with a clear arc, from cathedral entrance to CD activation and emotional resolution, though the symbolism-heavy narrative occasionally challenges clarity of cause-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and atmospheric, richly rendered with sensory language; the neon cathedral and firefly-lit fog create an emotionally resonant, surreal world that powerfully complements tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is emotionally evocative, rich in metaphor and subtext, and its lyrical prose carries both a sense of loss and fragile reclamation; an original and resonant exploration of courage and memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A deeply cohesive, stylistically confident piece that combines atmospheric worldbuilding, emotional weight, and symbolic resolution into a powerfully complete short arc.</comment>
