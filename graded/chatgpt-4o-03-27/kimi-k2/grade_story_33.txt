<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s emotional arc is vividly rendered through consistent motivation tied to personal trauma and a symbolic object; her internal contradictions enrich complexity without reducing clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc masterfully handles abstraction while maintaining coherence, with a satisfying resolution; only slightly abstracted causality in places interrupts otherwise fluid progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is hauntingly immersive, with rich sensory detail and atmospheric consistency; it supports both tone and theme with near-perfect integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels strikingly original, with inventive metaphors and a wholly unique aesthetic voice; minor moments verge on being too literary for clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unified tone, effective narrative layering, and thematic cohesion elevate this piece above typical constraints; very minor overwriting holds it just short of perfection.</comment>
