<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The inventor's character is poetic rather than deeply psychological, but his motivation—to fulfill a long-standing, cryptically expressed promise—remains consistent and emotionally resonant throughout, with subtle emotional reveals through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The structure follows a clear arc with thematic and emotional payoff; despite its surrealism, it maintains internal coherence. Cause-effect through rain, shipwrecks, and memories builds effectively, though some metaphysical shifts strain believability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined with immersive sensory details and highly atmospheric prose; the graveyard of ships becomes a living entity that echoes the character's inner state, enhancing mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story achieves emotional depth with lyrical prose, resonant symbolism, and a haunting tone. The ending is poignant and thematically conclusive, though the lack of tension may reduce broader narrative engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original in metaphor and concept integration; language is occasionally ornate yet avoids cliché. Symbolism feels fresh, though emotional nuance slightly overtakes narrative clarity at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion and literary ambition given the constraints. The story feels complete, carefully crafted, and evokes lasting emotion—though minor ambiguity may leave readers seeking clearer grounding.</comment>
