<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The undertaker’s grief-driven motivation is powerfully rendered and consistent; though largely internalized, his actions align tightly with his emotional state, and the promise to his daughter adds emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The circular structure—grief to hope—feels complete and earned within the compression of the word count; each beat flows logically, though exposition-heavy moments slightly hinder immediate narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive; evocative sensory detail, poetic architecture, and tonal harmony between setting and emotional texture create a singular world that enhances theme and tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, layered metaphor, and resonant emotional undercurrents elevate the craft—especially in the phrase economy and symbolic weight of actions—but a bit too reliant on poetic abstraction at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Genuinely original imagery and subtext show strong authorial voice; a few borderline ornate descriptions edge toward purple but are mostly justified by the story’s mythic tone and melancholic lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements are meaningfully interwoven; the story lingers through its emotional precision and thematic ambition despite the tight limit—a rare example of high-concept flash fiction that transcends constraints.</comment>
