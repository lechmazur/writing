<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s motivations are laced into the narrative with consistency—her actions with the spoon, door, and murals reveal psychological depth and a full arc, though her internal voice could be made more distinct from the atmospheric prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with surreal resonance, but the logic of some transitions (e.g., spoon activating murals into movement) strains credibility in small ways that slightly obstruct narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and immersive, with sensory-rich details that support tone and plot—particularly the synergy between the mountain’s magnetism, the decayed theater, and the charged surrealism of the murals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking symbolism and poetic language deeply enhance the theme of inheritance and chaos; however, the emotional payoff is more intellectual than visceral, skimming just shy of transcendent impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors are fresh and thematically anchored, and the surreal tone feels deliberate and stylized—not formulaic—though the ornate language occasionally veers toward excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite its brevity, the story feels fully realized and emotionally layered, with a crafted sense of consequence and legacy; minor abstraction in places keeps it from total clarity but not from resonance.</comment>
