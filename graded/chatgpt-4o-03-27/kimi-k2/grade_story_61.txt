<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The queen’s arc is emotionally rich and thematically resonant; her motivations (regret, redemption) align elegantly with her actions, though her personality could be clarified more distinctly in a few places.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story moves fluidly through a complete arc within its word limit; the final action and resolution are dramatically and thematically earned, though the logic of the dream journal’s mechanics is somewhat opaque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and stunningly rendered through sensory detail; the fungal orchard and bioluminescence deepen tone and theme cohesively, enhancing the emotional landscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorgeous use of language, metaphor, and structure supports an emotionally resonant, symbolically rich story; ending is strong, but emotional layering could be marginally more nuanced in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery is mostly fresh and specific, though a few phrases tread close to poetic overindulgence; emotional beats are strong and largely well-earned, though risk occasionally skimming into abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally impactful, and cohesively executed; the brief length feels intentional, and most elements feel integrated organically into a unique and memorable whole.</comment>
