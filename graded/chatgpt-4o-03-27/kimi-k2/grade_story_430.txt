<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hauntingly consistent characterization with emotional depth; the reaver’s motivations align with his actions and internal struggle, shown rather than told, though a touch more dialogue or reflection could enhance his arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional arc conveyed with poetic economy; the story completes a narrative loop, but the surreal setting slightly blurs cause-effect clarity in places, and a few transitions verge on overcompressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The surreal yet emotionally resonant world enhances theme and mood brilliantly; vivid sensory detail and symbolic motifs (oil-tears, teeth-stars) elevate the tone into something immersive and cohesive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly impactful with potent imagery and strong subtext; the layered metaphor and transformative resolution show deft literary control, though a few moments tip toward overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Excellent originality in metaphor and concept fusion; mostly avoids cliché, but minor lapses into stylized repetition or purple prose slightly dilute otherwise fresh expression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive, emotionally resonant, and artfully constructed—reads like a complete micro-epic with a clear if surreal theme; minor stylistic flourishes verge on indulgent but largely serve the piece well.</comment>
