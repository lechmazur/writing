<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The envoy’s internal conflict and resentment are conveyed with poetic intensity, and his transformation feels emotionally earned; however, his core motivation could be made slightly clearer earlier to better ground his decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative maintains a compelling arc within its brevity, with the envoy’s journey and the reveal of the living vine delivering resolution; a few metaphor-heavy passages slightly obscure causal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and vividly sensory, with fractured domes and alien botanics that reinforce the story’s tone and themes; an exceptional example of atmospheric worldbuilding in under 500 words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking literary devices and thematic resonance elevate the piece, particularly in its haunting final image and layered metaphors—though the density of abstraction may slightly distance some readers emotionally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Language and metaphors are often arresting and original, though some verge on overwrought, and a few phrases risk sounding more decorative than essential to the moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, emotionally resonant, and conceptually rich; minor opacity in early motivation and a slight overreliance on ornate phrasing are the only detractions from general excellence.</comment>
