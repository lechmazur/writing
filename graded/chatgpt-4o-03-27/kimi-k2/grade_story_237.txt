<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lush in symbolism and poetic economy, the story weaves theme and metaphor skillfully; the dice, the diaries, and the silver thread offer resonant imagery—though occasional sentimentality edges close to overstatement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and inventive combinations of sci-fi imagery and metaphor set this apart from cliché, though some language verges on overly ornate or stylized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegant synthesis of concept, tone, and character yields a story that lingers; its brevity feels like precision, not limitation, and the thematic integration is masterful.</comment>
