<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's inner conflict is vivid and well-articulated; her guilt and longing for atonement are consistently woven through her actions and memories, though some emotional transitions feel slightly manufactured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story executes a clear arc within the word limit—moving from guilt to redemption—while cleverly integrating metaphysical elements; the pacing is controlled, but the resolution may feel a touch convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly imagined and powerfully immersive, with sensory details (sulfur, blistered palms, molten lard) that contribute deeply to mood and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor, symbolism, and subtext; the hourglass and ribbon embody layered emotional stakes, and the ending delivers satisfying emotional weight with quiet finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original, with inventive imagery ("abrasive calm," "sand carving a helix"); language occasionally teeters toward over-poeticization but remains largely purposeful and unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking cohesion and thematic clarity; shows creative fusion of elements without feeling engineered; leaves a lasting impression and rewards rereading.</comment>
