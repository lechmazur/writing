<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The collector’s personal arc—from prodigy to archivist to redeemer—is compelling, coherent, and deeply tied to his infuriating calm; his actions are consistently motivated by regret and quiet defiance, though limited dialogue and external interactions slightly constrain dimensionality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The world is richly imagined—ethereal yet grounded—layered with texture and tone; the probability mapping center and its luminous timelines powerfully support the story’s themes of time, choice, and buried genius, rendered with subtle, immersive sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant and conceptually ambitious, the story skillfully weaves metaphor, symbolism, and poetic cadence into a moving meditation on regret and redemption; the final image lingers, though minor ambiguity in mechanics may slightly reduce broader impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative avoids formulaic patterns, subverts tropes, and delivers a distinctive stylistic voice; occasional ornamentation borders on purple prose, but the imagery mostly earns its weight through emotional and thematic function.</comment>
