<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivations feel deeply personal and consistent; her jaded hopefulness and refusal to obey fate are poignantly realized, though there's room for sharper psychological contrast between her past duty and the present rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is focused, symbolic, and tightly structured; the resolution is earned and thematically resonant, but slight ambiguity in logistical elements (e.g., voice note sequence, pit reveal) slightly mars clarity.</comment>
