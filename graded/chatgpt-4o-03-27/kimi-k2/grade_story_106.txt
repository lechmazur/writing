<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s arc from sullen farmer to visionary cartographer is emotionally coherent and symbolically rich; her motivations—to escape stagnation—are believable and mirrored through tactile actions like stitching, although her original personality remains more sketched than deeply developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with organic momentum, from despair to transformation, with evocative cause-effect logic; each action seamlessly drives the next, and the arc is satisfyingly complete despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The underwater power station as setting is both haunting and metaphorically potent; sensory details and bioluminescent imagery create an immersive, atmospheric world tightly bound to the story’s thematic undercurrents.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors, lyrical prose, and layered symbolism around reclamation and identity infuse the narrative with emotional and intellectual resonance; the ending is moving, though perhaps a touch idealized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The imagery and metaphors feel specific and fresh (e.g., stamps as maps, quilt as bridge); the prose occasionally veers toward ornate, but remains purposeful and avoids cliché or mechanical phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>All elements feel tightly interwoven in service of the theme; the story is both formally and emotionally cohesive, with a narrative arc that transcends its constraints and leaves a lingering impression.</comment>
