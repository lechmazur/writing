<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character’s motivation is poetic yet coherent, and her arc from assassin to guardian is well-rendered; however, her internal conflict, while evocative, could benefit from slightly more grounding or development within the limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is compact and emotionally complete, with a satisfying resolution; a few transitions—particularly around the midpoint—are lyrically dense enough to momentarily obscure causality.</comment>
