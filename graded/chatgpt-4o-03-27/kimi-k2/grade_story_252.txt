<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thief’s penitence is well-rendered, with her motivations tied closely to her past crimes and the object she carries; however, her emotional arc, while evocative, is more symbolic than psychologically nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and satisfying within the tight word limit, avoiding major leaps in logic; only minor coherence gaps emerge in the metaphysical transitions near the ending.</comment>
