<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is cohesive with metaphorical resolution and a compelling cyclical structure; however, the surreal density slightly obscures causal clarity at times within the short format.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking symbolism and layered metaphors craft an elegant meditation on meaning and persistence; while subtle, the story’s impact grows on re-reading, though a more emotional arc might elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Impressively original syntax, fresh metaphors, and non-formulaic structure; avoids clichés and achieves stylistic distinctiveness and thematic depth with a surprisingly human cadence despite its surrealism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, thematically driven, and lingers evocatively; nearly publishable at the top tier, needing only slight tuning in clarity to be unequivocally elite.</comment>
