<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mabel’s voice and motivation are strong, with her actions—stealing the tag, seeking the recipe—clearly tied to her identity; however, emotional interiority is subtly conveyed and could use sharper contrast to fully deepen her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot flows with surreal but intentional logic; the dismantling of portals as narrative climax is poetically managed, though the connective tissue between character action and consequence flirts with abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is lush, immersive, and integral to the tone and theme; sensory details—cinnamon, smoke, carved owls—are vivid and unify atmosphere with symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and lyrical prose elevate the story; subtext around legacy, memory, and flawed beauty is profound, though its density slightly blurs tension at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original with few clichés; poetic language mostly purposeful, though occasionally veers into over-stylization that slightly hampers clarity or pacing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Displays high-level synthesis of theme, tone, and form; minor clarity sacrifices for lyricism are the only barrier to flawless execution.</comment>
