<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some metaphors skirt purple prose, but most are inventive; language is specific and musical, though occasionally teetering on the artificial or excessively ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Despite abstraction, the story coheres through tone and structural echo, with strong thematic unity and a graceful blend of the mystical and grounded elements.</comment>
