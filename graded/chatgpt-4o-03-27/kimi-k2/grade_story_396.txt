<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lucie’s personality is vivid and consistent—her forgetfulness, tactile memory, and quiet rebellion feel authentically human and layered; Malik is slightly less developed but serves as a fitting foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves surprising coherence and resolution within tight constraints, though the pacing verges on breathless and Malik’s sudden willingness to sabotage could use more grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original combinations of elements, fresh metaphorical language, and subversion of tropes suggest strong authorial voice—very little feels formulaic or machine-generated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>There’s a strong cohesion of elements, striking prose, and emotional resonance compressed into a delightfully strange but wholly unified narrative.</comment>
