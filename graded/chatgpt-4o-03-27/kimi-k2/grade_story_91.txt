<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 7 is a surprisingly soulful character whose transformation from destructive experiment to nurturing force is both thematically rich and emotionally compelling; however, the lack of direct conflict or interaction with others slightly limits dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with a clear arc and elegant pacing, leading to a satisfying emotional resolution; the method of reinforcement through cloud shadows is abstract but anchored well in the context of this world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric worldbuilding is evocative and layered—rich sensory detail, immersive tone, and symbolic setting all contribute masterfully to mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose displays fine craftsmanship—lyrical, poetic, and symbolic—but at times flirts with purple prose, and the lack of interpersonal tension slightly softens its dramatic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original concept and execution, with spare, resonant language and meaningful imagery; minor moments feel slightly algorithmic, but overall voice is strong and distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>This is a cohesive, poignant narrative with depth, creativity, and literary ambition; minor abstraction in character interaction prevents a perfect score.</comment>
