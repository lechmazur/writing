<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's phobia-ridden identity and drive to reclaim courage are consistently developed, her motivations clear and viscerally rendered through symbolic action; a few moments are overwritten, slightly distancing emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arc is clear and satisfying—beginning with apprehension, progressing through confrontation of fear, and culminating in liberation; the symbolic unpacking through the knots maintains thematic integrity and strong narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive and evocative, entwining decay and transcendence; sensory details (salt, mildew, frayed net) ground the surreal setting with tactile vividness, fully supporting tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and lyrical prose; emotional resonance is layered and profound, culminating in a powerful ending that echoes the story’s central tension between danger and control.</comment>
