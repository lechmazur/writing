<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira is vividly drawn—her actions align with her role as monarch and her internal ember clearly drives her; the “lethargically energetic” trait feels abstract but is threaded effectively through her movement and choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is compact but whole: beginning in contemplation, climaxing in decision, resolving in transformation; pacing is deliberate yet well-managed, though the logic behind some metaphysical mechanics is intentionally opaque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive; sensory details like “rain hissing like serpents” and “liquid glass” rain establish a unique world that enhances the story’s tone and emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (feather, ember, puzzle); emotional resonance emerges in subtle ways; the final note is both enigmatic and cathartic, prompting reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is lyrical without becoming bloated; imagery is original and fresh, avoiding formula; character emotion is shown through action and sensory interaction rather than being stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite density of elements, the story feels purposeful; stylistic ambition is largely successful, with a lingering sense of mythic resonance and thematic clarity.</comment>
