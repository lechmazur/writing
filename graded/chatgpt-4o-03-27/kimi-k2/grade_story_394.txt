<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels original with strong symbolic cohesion; some surreal elements feel AI-adjacent in abstraction but are anchored by emotionally specific choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece is unified and purposeful, using its brevity to deliver deep emotional resonance; creative ambition is high and generally successful, though occasionally stylistically overwrought.</comment>
