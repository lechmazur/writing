<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains emotional clarity and avoids disjointedness despite the abstract setting; though subtle and thematically driven, the arc—from observing a dying light to planting new pages—forms a coherent cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully tied to the atmosphere—moody, surreal, and symbolic—with sensory detail that enhances the gravity of her quiet ritual; the dojo floating in void underscores the theme of impermanence.</comment>
