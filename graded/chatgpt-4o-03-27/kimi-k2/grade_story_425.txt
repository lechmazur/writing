<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Halden’s melancholy and long-suffering sense of purpose are well-rendered and consistent, with his reaction to the sewing needle and the blackout revealing depth and evolution, although the woman’s role is slightly underdeveloped as a foil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting details are evocative and immersive, with “lavishly austere” used meaningfully; atmosphere aligns tightly with theme and character, creating a strong sense of place and tone without excess exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rich in metaphor and symbolism (e.g., stitching galaxies), the story delivers emotional resonance and thematic depth, with lyrical prose and an ending that lingers in the reader’s mind; the central conflict—purpose in entropy—is elegantly resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery is mostly original and metaphorical language purposeful; though a few phrasings verge on the florid, they are largely grounded in emotional weight and narrative coherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive and emotionally rewarding narrative with stylistic originality, thematic depth, and precise integration of elements—clearly crafted rather than assembled, leaving lasting resonance.</comment>
