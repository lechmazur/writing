<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's character is vividly rendered through poetic action and symbolic response; her motivation to preserve indigenous dances is clear and deeply entwined with her grief and craft, though her emotional interior could be explored with greater depth beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot arc—ritualistic unlocking of lost memory—is coherent and complete despite abstraction; pacing builds well toward a symbolic climax, though some transitions teeter on the edge of being too surreal to fully ground in cause and effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined, thematically resonant, and tonally immersive; sensory details (salt wind, burnt sugar, upward rain) deepen atmosphere organically without overwhelming the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story’s lyrical style, metaphorical depth, and emotional layering are potent, with strong subtext about cultural erasure and remembrance; the ending offers catharsis, though the prose sometimes overreaches into near-obscurity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through surreal and symbolic elements woven with emotional truth; only occasional over-ornamentation and slight lapses in narrative clarity prevent a perfect mark.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, imaginative piece with a strong sense of purpose, emotional stakes, and symbolic payoff; its risks mostly pay off, though grounding just a shade more could enhance accessibility.</comment>
