<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lysander is vividly rendered through his sensory memory, idiosyncratic actions, and evolving emotional arc; his morally ambiguous nature shifts subtly but believably into a more resolved state that aligns with his introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot unfolds with elegant surrealism yet maintains a coherent arc from mundane disruption to spiritual transformation; the xerograph motif and seed imagery anchor the narrative momentum effectively within tight space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The richly evocative settings—from fluorescent grocery aisles to the soot-haunted tower—build a surreal yet tactile world, dense with sensory texture and metaphor, fully integrated with mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and symbolic resonance; the prose is lyrical without excess, and thematic layers around memory, regret, and renewal emerge through potent imagery and a satisfying emotional journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic yet grounded in specificity; metaphors feel original (e.g., seed packets like old love letters); language is distinctive, and emotional nuance is rendered through implication, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Expertly balanced compression of surreal narrative within practical anchors; high conceptual ambition matched by precise and moving execution, leaving thematic impact long after final image.</comment>
