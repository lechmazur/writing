<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alaric’s motivations are poetic yet coherent, aligned with his lineage and rebellious intellect; though internal psychology is sketched more mythically than intimately.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc flows with surreal coherence, building from individual expression to cultural shift; resolution is thematic, not plot-based, yet satisfying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original and stylistically distinct; language borders on ornate but remains purposeful—fresh imagery sustains mood without cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A masterfully integrated piece where form follows theme with near-symphonic cohesion; leaves behind mood and reflection rare in flash fiction.</comment>
