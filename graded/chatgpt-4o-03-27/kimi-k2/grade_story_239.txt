<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arlo’s motivations are poetic and consistent with the illusionist archetype; his connection to the lunchbox and timeline manipulation reveals depth, though his emotional interiority remains slightly underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot arc is compelling and self-contained, with clear cause-effect logic. The time loop structure adds complexity, but the climax resolves quickly and misses a final emotional beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and lyrical prose elevate the story; metaphors like “constellations made of sap” and the looping narrative add emotional depth and thematic poignancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is poetic but occasionally veers into purple; most metaphors are original, though a few feel ornamental. Still, emotional resonance and innovation are strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nearly all elements serve the narrative organically; despite minor over-stylization, the story is cohesive, emotionally engaging, and lingers with thematic weight.</comment>
