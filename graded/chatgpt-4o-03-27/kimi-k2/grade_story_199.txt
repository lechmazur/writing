<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Juno is a distinct and compelling figure with a clear, consistent drive; her motivations and rituals are poetic yet grounded in grief and inherited myth, though her emotional interior could be explored further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The structure is elliptical but coherent, with strong internal logic and symbolic resonance; the ending rewards the buildup meaningfully, though the narrative walks a fine line between lyrical abstraction and clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is richly immersive, using sensory detail and surreal logic to evoke a dream-disrupted world; the urban orchard is both literal and metaphysical, deeply entwined with character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor, symbolism, and rhythm; the story lingers emotionally and intellectually, though it risks opacity at moments due to its density of imagery and lack of conventional conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original, evocative, and stylistically consistent; the narrative voice avoids clich√© and instead invents its own symbolic logic, though one or two turns of phrase veer toward overwriting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>An ambitious and beautifully strange piece that demonstrates literary inventiveness, emotional resonance, and thematic depth, succeeding within the tight word count.</comment>
