<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Axel’s motivations are emotionally resonant and consistently deepened through symbolic action; his arc from haunted worker to spiritual guide shows layered character development, though his voice remains somewhat distant due to a lack of direct dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc unfolds with dream-logic coherence, and the transformation from pain to restoration is structurally sound; some transitions are poetic rather than practical, which may challenge literalists but suits the allegorical tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly surreal and metaphor-rich; sensory imagery—bones, sap, gravel, broth—immerses the reader, and the ossuary-restaurant is both inventive and thematically significant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Affecting, multi-layered storytelling with striking symbolism; the emotional arc is powerfully rendered and the resolution deeply satisfying, though some ambiguity may veil clarity for some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich originality and poetic precision elevate the story; metaphors are inventive and integral rather than decorative, though a few phrases teeter on lyrical excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally resonant, and stylistically confident work; the narrative is tightly woven, its elements reinforcing each other with purpose and depth.</comment>
