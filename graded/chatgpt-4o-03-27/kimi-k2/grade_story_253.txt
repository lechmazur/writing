<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Finch is compelling and consistent, his silence, limp, and motivations merging into a complex portrait; however, his arc resolves too easily considering the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is coherent and tight for the word count, with a clear emotional and narrative progression, though the climax folds inward rather than driving tension forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with layered metaphors and sensory detail; the electronic wilderness and schoolhouse evoke a haunting, tactile mood that supports theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphor and subtext; the story lingers emotionally and philosophically, though the resolution slightly tiptoes around moral ambiguity that could have been more sharply drawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive and emotionally nuanced with original imagery (“trapped star,” “déjà vu spelled backwards”); rarely lapses into cliché or mechanical phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A masterful blend of character, setting, and theme; slight friction in plot resolution pacing keeps it from attaining absolute polish, but deeply memorable and publishable.</comment>
