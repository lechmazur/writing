<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between her death wish and her vow to map energy was vividly articulated and felt deeply human; the resolution aligns smoothly with her motivations, but her emotional transformation happens a bit too rapidly to be fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed with a compelling arc—beginning with a death wish, climaxing in suspended time, and resolving in transcendence—but the mechanism of interpreting radio calls stretches believability slightly within the story’s otherwise grounded mythos.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The subterranean setting, sensory-rich language, and atmospheric build-up are exceptionally immersive and enhance the mystical tone; the imagery of the waterfall and ice sculpture is especially evocative and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s emotional impact is strong and supported by potent metaphor and symbolism, particularly the bookmark and reversed waterfall; the prose walks the line between poetic and overwrought, but mostly lands powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original in presenting a mystical, geomantic society through the lens of a poison taster, though a few phrases verge on purple prose and the radio-psychic link feels slightly artificial in contrast to the otherwise elegant worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly structured within constraints, emotionally resonant, and leaves a lingering impression; a few transitions feel slightly convenient, but overall it convincingly marries surreal tone with deep emotional stakes.</comment>
