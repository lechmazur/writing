<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The protagonist is vividly drawn—haunted, meticulous, driven by grief and justice. His rituals, tools, and methods all reinforce his psychology. Motivation is clear and consistent, though a touch more internal conflict might deepen him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story spans a full arc with clever cause-effect turns, from routine to catharsis. Coherence is solid, though a few logical leaps (e.g., the mural’s live updates) risk straining believability under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is dense with purposeful metaphor and sensory detail. The interplay between mundane and surreal—orchardist in wind tunnels, peacock mural as cipher—builds a richly strange mood that smartly supports theme and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Remarkably layered: poetic phrasing, sly humor, and potent symbolism (e.g., pruning justice, peacock’s tail as code). The ending is both emotionally and thematically resonant. High storytelling craft with minimal exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original in voice and method—mural patterns as conspiracy code is fresh and subversive. Though theatrical, never feels generic or templated. A few metaphors verge on ornate but mostly serve the narrative well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive; every element reinforces another—from the antique seal to the drone sabotage. Feels like a distilled chapter from a longer, artful work. Lingers after reading through theme and tone more than plot.</comment>
