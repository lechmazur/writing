<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motivations and inner conflict are thematically rich and well-aligned with her dreamy, resigned character; her emotional arc is subtle but effective, though some internal responses could be deepened slightly for full dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying within tight limits, with an elegant cyclical structure and strong cause-effect logic; the journey through the orchard to the cockpit-hollow resolves meaningfully, though a minor beat or two feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is deeply immersive and consistently symbolic, with a rich sensory tapestry and seamless integration of atmosphere, action, and theme; the orchard is both literal and metaphorical, enhancing the story’s dreamlike, fatalistic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and subtext, with emotionally resonant imagery and a memorable central conceit; the story shows rather than tells, and the prose rarely overreaches despite its lyrical bent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impressively original in concept and execution, with effective subversion of genre tropes; voice is distinctive and language carefully chosen, though one or two metaphors veer close to overabundance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally potent, with imaginative synergy across assigned elements; a rare instance of brevity feeling like a deliberate artistic parameter rather than a constraint.</comment>
