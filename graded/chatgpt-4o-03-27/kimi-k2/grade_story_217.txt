<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lila is vividly drawn, her motivations intertwining with past rebellion and present yearning, though Mateo could use fuller dimensionality to enhance emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is structurally sound with a compelling arc, but the middle leans heavily on aesthetic interludes; the resolution resonates emotionally but borders on cinematic sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered—sensory details (fog, mildew, popcorn, rust, rising dawn) are immersive and tonally unified with the haunted setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The writing is lyrical and affecting, with effective symbolism and poetic metaphor; some imagery teeters close to overwrought, but overall impact is emotionally and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, layered symbolism, and non-generic sensory detail elevate the story, though some phrasing risks purple prose and the emotional nuances are stronger for Lila than Mateo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite dense imagery, the story is cohesive, imaginative, and emotionally resonant—a rare blend of poetic ambition and narrative clarity within a tight word count.</comment>
