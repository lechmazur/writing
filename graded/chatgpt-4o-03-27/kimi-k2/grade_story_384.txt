<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lila is vividly motivated and her emotional intensity aligns with her role as both cook and saboteur; her actions stem convincingly from grief, legacy, and rebellion, though her internal voice remains distant due to the lack of direct introspection or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story achieves remarkable coherence given its brevity—establishing mystery, conflict, and resolution through a tightly structured arc—though the mechanics of the bread reveal stretch plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The dust-laden seismic facility is rendered with surreal, poetic detail that shapes mood and reinforces the theme of buried truths; sensory language is immersive and metaphorically rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Symbolism is layered and intelligent (e.g., stick, eraser, bread), with strong payoff; the prose is lyrical without lapsing into purple, and the ending delivers emotional weight and poetic justice, though dialogue absence is notable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor are original and well-integrated; the narrative avoids cliché, and pacing is confident and deliberate, though minor traces of mechanical phrasing linger in transitions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and thematically resonant, the story uses its elements in service of a compelling emotional arc and thought-provoking premise that linger beyond the last line.</comment>
