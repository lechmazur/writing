<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Consistent and layered portrayal of Lysander—his disgrace, guilt, and obsessive reconstruction of the past reveal deep motivation and a distinct personality; voice and actions align with motivation throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegant arc from fragmented guilt to symbolic confession; strong cause-effect coherence, though the complexity verges on overwrought within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and original framing—candor literalized through combustion and drone projection; slight tendency toward overwritten prose doesn't obscure narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dense but deliberate; a poetic and cohesive blend of concept, character, and theme that lingers after reading—uncommon narrative elegance at this word length.</comment>
