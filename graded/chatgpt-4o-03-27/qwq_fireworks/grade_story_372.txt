<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s grief and detachment are well-evoked, and her motivation to redirect the avalanche is emotionally grounded, but her emotional arc feels slightly rushed and underdeveloped given the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds to a satisfying climax, with strong cause-effect logic; however, the pacing is slightly compressed, and some transitions (e.g., the figure’s reappearances) feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory detail and a strong sense of place; the neon rain, bioluminescent moss, and ozone-laced tunnels all enhance the mood and theme effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., reflections, the label), and the emotional undercurrent is compelling; the ending resonates, though some dialogue edges toward cliché.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and subversions are present, but a few phrases feel slightly generic or overwritten; the emotional nuance is mostly shown, though occasionally told too directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements and a resonant emotional arc; minor clarity issues and slight overcompression hold it back from top-tier polish.</comment>
