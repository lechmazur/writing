<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clara’s arc from passive observer to active reckoner is compelling, but her internal motivations are underexplored; her transformation feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and builds tension effectively within the word limit, though the climax feels slightly rushed and the resolution a bit too neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with vivid sensory detail and a strong gothic tone; the mansion and garden feel alive and thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Despite minor pacing issues, the story is cohesive, thematically layered, and emotionally resonant; it lingers after reading.</comment>
