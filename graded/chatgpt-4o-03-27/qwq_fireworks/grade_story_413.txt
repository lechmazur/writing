<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cedric’s transformation from ennui to emotional awakening is well-rendered, with his listlessness and naively sophisticated demeanor informing his arc; however, Marnie’s role as catalyst could use more depth to fully justify his shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the maze’s logic-defying nature is thematically consistent, though some transitions verge on abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric, with vivid sensory details and surreal imagery that enhance tone and theme; the haunted corn maze and will-o’-wisps are both original and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance, layered symbolism (scarf, laughter, intention), and a satisfying thematic resolution elevate the story; dialogue is stylized but purposeful, though some metaphors border on overwrought.</comment>
