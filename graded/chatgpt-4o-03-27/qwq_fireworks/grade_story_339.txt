<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and emotionally resonant, with a satisfying return to the seesaw. Some transitions feel slightly compressed, but the structure holds under the word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail—the prismatic lake, rusted playground, and construction site all contribute to a haunting, liminal atmosphere that mirrors Lila’s inner conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is emotionally evocative and thematically rich, using symbolism (seesaw, drawer knob, sequins) to deepen meaning. The ending is subtle yet resonant, though a touch more ambiguity might elevate it further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and specific imagery avoid cliché; emotional nuance is shown rather than told. The writing feels intentional and stylistically consistent, with only minor hints of over-formality in phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive and emotionally impactful, the story integrates its elements with care. It lingers in the mind, though a slightly more surprising narrative turn could push it to perfection.</comment>
