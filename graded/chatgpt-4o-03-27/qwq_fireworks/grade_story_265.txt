<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vey’s impassivity is well-established and meaningfully challenged by his experience; his motivation to witness grace is clear and consistent, though his emotional arc could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the oil change task is cleverly stretched into a moment of transformation, though the pulley’s groan feels slightly convenient as a return to duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is richly immersive and original, with sensory details (honey, damp wood, bioluminescent sap) that elevate the atmosphere and reinforce the story’s themes of hidden life and reverence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphor (e.g., orchard roots as teeth, bees spelling questions) create emotional resonance and subtext; the story shows rather than tells, though the climax could be slightly more surprising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a consistent, lyrical tone; avoids clichés and formulaic structure, though a few phrases verge on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements are integrated with care and purpose, and the story lingers emotionally; the twist tie as a symbolic anchor is especially effective, though the ending could risk more ambiguity or tension.</comment>
