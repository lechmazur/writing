<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The knight’s internal conflict between duty and compassion is well-rendered, with her actions—especially the mitten and altar contributions—revealing a layered, evolving character whose motivations align with her lawful yet rebellious nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; however, the pacing slightly compresses the emotional climax, and the agency’s shift in stance feels a touch abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric, from the cold intersection to the buzzing center and intimate apartment; sensory details and tone reinforce the knight’s emotional thaw and the story’s quiet melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance, elegant symbolism (e.g., phoenix mosaic), and subtle subtext elevate the narrative; the story shows rather than tells, though the dialogue is minimal and could deepen impact further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique blend of espionage and folk ritual avoid cliché; a few moments veer toward sentimentality, but overall the voice is distinct and emotionally nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of disparate elements; it lingers emotionally and thematically, though a slightly more surprising twist could elevate it further.</comment>
