<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evelyn’s torn psyche—half scholar, half madwoman—is vividly rendered through her obsessive quest and fragmented dialogue; her motivations are clear and consistent, though the old man’s depth is less developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the pacing is tight and logical, though the sudden syncing of book and phone strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric—vines, mildew, and ancient books create a tactile, immersive world that mirrors the characters’ internal decay and hope; sensory detail is exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and layered symbolism (light, cycles, buried knowledge); the ending is both poetic and thematically satisfying, though some dialogue edges toward the theatrical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story; while some phrasing flirts with purple prose, the originality and emotional nuance outweigh minor stylistic excesses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and emotionally resonant; the elements feel organically integrated, and the story lingers with a sense of wonder and quiet revelation.</comment>
