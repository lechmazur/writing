<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions—singing, tossing coins, deciphering the pamphlet—align with her desperation to escape. However, her emotional depth and internal conflict could be more fully realized to elevate her from symbolic figure to fully human character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution. The coin tosses and melody-building method are well-integrated, though some transitions between moments feel slightly abstract or rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is rich in metaphor and symbolism, particularly the coins and melody as tools of memory and escape. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though a touch more clarity in the mechanics of the simulation might strengthen impact.</comment>
