<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s rebellious nature is clearly established and consistently drives her actions, especially through her living obituaries and defiance of the giant’s determinism; however, her emotional depth and internal conflict could be more fully explored to elevate her beyond a symbolic figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a strong arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the cause-effect chain is mostly coherent, though the climax’s metaphysical shift could benefit from slightly more grounding to avoid abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with vivid sensory details and a surreal atmosphere that enhances the story’s themes; the giant’s bookshelf and pipe organ chamber are both symbolic and functional, supporting tone and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically layered, using metaphor and symbolism effectively; the ending is powerful and satisfying, though some transitions verge on overwrought, slightly diluting clarity.</comment>
