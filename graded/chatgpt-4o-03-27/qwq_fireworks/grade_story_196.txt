<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s arc from apathy to action is compelling and emotionally resonant; his motivations are clearly rooted in past disillusionment and reignited by Jorin’s defiance, though his “fierce apathy” occasionally feels overwritten.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a strong internal logic and satisfying arc within the word limit; the leap from the monastery to the altar is both literal and symbolic, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail and metaphor; the floating monastery and shifting rocks enhance the story’s themes of instability and escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and symbolism (meteors, starflower, crumbling monastery) elevate the narrative; the final line lands with emotional weight, though some metaphors verge on excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the story avoids clichés and shows stylistic flair, a few phrases feel slightly too polished or poetic, risking artificiality; overall, it’s a fresh and emotionally nuanced take.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion, emotional resonance, and thematic clarity make this a standout piece; minor stylistic overreach keeps it just shy of perfection.</comment>
