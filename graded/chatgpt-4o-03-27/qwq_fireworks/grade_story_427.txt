<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias and Mara are distinct, with motivations rooted in ideology; Elias’s mechanical arm and symbolic fixation reflect his internal conflict, though Mara’s shift at the end feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a clear arc and resolution; the cipher and duel drive the narrative effectively, though the generator activation feels slightly convenient.</comment>
