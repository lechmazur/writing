<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The noble’s motivations are layered and consistent, with their actions—decoding stubs, confronting family legacy—clearly shaped by their forgotten status and desire for truth; however, emotional depth is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and complete within the word limit, with a satisfying arc and resolution; the combustion incidents and ticket stubs form a logical mystery, though some transitions verge on abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail—flames, condensation, nano-filaments—and the atmosphere of decay and revelation supports the tone and theme exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and symbolism (ticket stubs, combustion, drone), with a resonant theme of truth and legacy; the ending is luminous and emotionally satisfying, though slightly esoteric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors and a unique tone; a few phrases flirt with over-stylization, but overall the voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant; the elements feel integrated rather than forced, and the brevity enhances rather than limits its impact.</comment>
