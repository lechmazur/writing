<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thorne’s motivations are clear and consistent, and his “gracefully awkward” demeanor is well-integrated into his actions and interactions, particularly with Lira; however, his emotional arc could be deepened further for maximal resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and well-paced, with a clear arc and resolution; the coded letter and ossuary setting drive the narrative effectively, though some transitions (e.g., from nightmares to action) feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ossuary-turned-restaurant is vividly rendered and atmospherically rich, with strong sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the setting enhances both tone and theme exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story is emotionally evocative and thematically layered, with strong symbolism and a satisfying resolution; some dialogue edges toward functional rather than revelatory, but overall craft is high.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story, though occasional phrasing veers toward ornate or slightly generic; emotional nuance is mostly well-handled but not flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposeful, with creative integration of elements and a lingering emotional impact; minor tonal inconsistencies prevent a perfect score.</comment>
