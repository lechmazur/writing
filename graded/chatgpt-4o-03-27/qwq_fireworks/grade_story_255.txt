<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clara’s motivations are clear and consistent, and her analytical nature is subtly but effectively shown through her deduction of the code. However, her emotional depth and internal conflict could be more fully developed to elevate her beyond a functional protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story has a strong arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The pacing is well-managed, and the cause-effect logic is sound. However, the climax feels slightly rushed, and the resolution, while satisfying, could benefit from more tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and richly textured, with excellent sensory detail—especially scent and sound. The setting enhances the mood and supports the narrative’s themes of decay and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with effective symbolism (rain, drought, decay). The writing is elegant and evocative, though the ending could carry more emotional weight with deeper character introspection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While some metaphors verge on familiar, the story avoids clichés and demonstrates a distinct voice. The integration of elements is mostly seamless, though a few transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically layered, and leaves a lasting impression. It balances clarity with poetic language and uses its brevity effectively. A few moments could be more emotionally nuanced, but overall, it’s compelling and memorable.</comment>
