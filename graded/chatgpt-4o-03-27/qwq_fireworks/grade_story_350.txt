<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra is vividly rendered through tactile habits and emotional unraveling; her motivation to uncover truth aligns with her perfectionism and past, though her puppeteer identity could be more integrated into her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant end; the symbolic logic of the gown and stamps is elegant, though the puzzle-solving progression is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple setting is richly atmospheric, with sensory detail and mythic resonance enhancing the mood; the interplay of dust, stone, and sound deepens the emotional tone and supports the narrative’s themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphor elevate the prose; the emotional climax is subtle yet powerful, and the use of puppets and stamps as symbols of memory and control is deftly handled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original metaphors and layered symbolism show strong authorial voice; a few phrases verge on ornate, and the puppeteer element feels underutilized, but overall the story avoids cliché and formula.</comment>
