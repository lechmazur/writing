<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sir Alden’s motivation is clear and consistent, and his cleverly naive nature is subtly conveyed through his initial dismissal of danger; however, his emotional arc could be deepened with more internal conflict or dialogue to fully flesh out his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the pacing is well-managed, though the resolution feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more tension before the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., orchard fruit as regrets), and the story evokes a poignant emotional response; however, some moments verge on overwrought and could be more restrained for greater impact.</comment>
