<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution. Cause and effect are mostly logical, though the climax feels slightly rushed in execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and a consistent tone. The fusion of medieval and sci-fi elements is handled with surprising elegance, enhancing the atmosphere and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and metaphor (e.g., dragons, saplings, fire) enriches the narrative. The ending is emotionally resonant, though some dialogue feels slightly expository rather than organic.</comment>
