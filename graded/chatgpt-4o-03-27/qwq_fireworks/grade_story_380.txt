<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict and emotional arc are compelling and consistent, with her mathematically challenged mind and fragmented identity shaping her actions; however, her transformation feels slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc with a clear beginning, middle, and resolution; the plunge and storm ritual are well-integrated, though the leap from soccer to solving the equation strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is richly atmospheric and deeply tied to the character’s emotional state; sensory details and tone create a vivid, immersive world that enhances the narrative’s surreal melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., soccer as symmetry, photo album as memory); the ending is emotionally resonant and thematically satisfying, though some transitions verge on poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and emotionally nuanced, with fresh imagery and subverted tropes; a few moments feel slightly overwritten or verge on purple prose, but overall the voice is distinct and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally rich, and thematically cohesive; the story feels complete and lingers after reading, though a few conceptual leaps could be more grounded.</comment>
