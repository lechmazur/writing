<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s motivations are clearly rooted in guilt and a need for closure; his recklessness and emotional arc are consistent and compelling, though secondary characters like Vasko and the artists could be more dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and emotionally resonant end; pacing is tight, though the crypt sequence feels slightly rushed.</comment>
