<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s arc is emotionally resonant and her motivations—rooted in guilt, fear, and redemption—are clearly conveyed through her actions and internal monologue; her transformation is both literal and symbolic, though her voice could be slightly more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a satisfying arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and cathartic resolution; the cause-effect chain is strong, though the pacing slightly compresses the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory detail—dust storms, radioactive soil, glowing apples—and deeply entwined with the story’s themes of decay and rebirth; atmosphere enhances both tone and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and symbolism (glitter, glass, orchard) elevates the narrative; the emotional payoff is strong, though some lines verge on overwrought; subtext and theme are well-integrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original imagery and thematic layering distinguish the story, though a few phrases flirt with purple prose; emotional nuance is mostly shown, not told, and the narrative avoids formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite the density of elements, the story feels cohesive and purposeful; the emotional and thematic resonance lingers, and the style supports clarity and depth without excess ornamentation.</comment>
