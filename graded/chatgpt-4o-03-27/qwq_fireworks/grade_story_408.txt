<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias is a well-drawn character with a clear internal conflict between pacifism and duty; his evolution from reluctant observer to defiant actor is compelling, though Lilaâ€™s motivations could use more depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story maintains a strong arc within the word limit, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the pacing is tight, though the final confrontation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a unique premise elevate the story; a few slightly ornate phrases verge on purple prose, but overall the voice is distinctive and human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive, atmospheric, and thematically cohesive; the story lingers after reading and uses its elements in service of a chilling, original narrative.</comment>
