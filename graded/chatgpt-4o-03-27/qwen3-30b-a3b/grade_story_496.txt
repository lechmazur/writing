<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The poet's repression and fear are subtly and consistently conveyed, and their arc toward expression is believable and emotionally earned, though their dialogue, while evocative, edges into abstraction over specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc from repression to revelation, with a satisfying resolution; however, the "ambush" moment feels more symbolic than functional in plot structure, slightly reducing narrative clarity.</comment>
