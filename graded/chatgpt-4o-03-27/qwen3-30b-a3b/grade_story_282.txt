<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thorne's character is vivid and consistent, with his brashness and blacksmith identity shaping his actions, but his motivation—preserving traditional games—feels a bit underexplored and suddenly introduced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story flows logically with a clear arc and resolution, but the exact mechanics of the ritual and how the medal connects to the concept of reciprocity remain abstract and could be more grounded.</comment>
