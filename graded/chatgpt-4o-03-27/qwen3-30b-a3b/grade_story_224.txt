<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The minstrel's internal transformation is clear and thematically resonant, though subtle; his motivations are gently conveyed through action and metaphor, but his "openly private" trait lacks stronger integration beyond poetic framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is emotionally and structurally complete within the word limit, though the transformation pivots more on mood than concrete events; transitions are mostly smooth, but clarity occasionally blurs beneath abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is imaginatively conceived and atmospherically rich; sensory language and symbolic environment elevate the tone and mirror internal conflict, with the dining room transformed into a metaphorical space of renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poetic language and metaphor deepen emotional resonance; the story evokes reflection and wonder, though some imagery borders on opacity; the ending lingers effectively, though tension remains mostly internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clich√©, uses metaphor inventively, and maintains emotional nuance; a few phrases stray into slightly overwrought territory, but overall, the voice feels deliberate and refined rather than mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece blends concept, character, and mood with creative cohesion; while dense in metaphor, it sustains emotional clarity and offers a satisfying journey within its compact form.</comment>
