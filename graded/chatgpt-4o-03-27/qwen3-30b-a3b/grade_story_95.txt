<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian is distinct, with a consistent internal motivation reflected in his actions and emotional journey; however, deeper interactions or more active conflict could enhance dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a poetic arc within the word limit, but some causal leaps (e.g., the button’s effect on the storm) feel slightly abstract rather than narratively grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The immersive atmosphere is rich and effectively tied to Elian’s internal state, though some sensory detail could be more concretely rendered to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance, elegant prose, effective metaphor and symbolism; the abstract tension is compelling, though subtly introduced and resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The writing is original and avoids cliché, but occasionally flirts with ornate phrasing; a few metaphors feel more lyrical than necessary for clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A cohesive, reflective story that lingers emotionally and intellectually; the integration of elements is mostly seamless, with a strong thematic core.</comment>
