<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara is a well-realized character whose empathic nature both drives the story and amplifies its emotional depth; however, her internal conflict and arc could be further sharpened to elevate investment in her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and satisfying within the word limit; the marshalling and reassembly are handled well, though pacing is occasionally dense with metaphor at the expense of clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece feels complete, inspired, and deliberate despite the word constraint; a lasting thematic weight imbues the tight narrative with notable depth.</comment>
