<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elric's personality is consistent and layered—his distrust and docility align with his quiet rebellion, and his motivations are effectively revealed through his symbolic actions. However, his voice is filtered entirely through third-person narration, limiting emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc—from tension to symbolic resolution—and the action of jettisoning the candlestick is well-motivated. Yet, some transitions between internal reflection and physical events feel abrupt, slightly disrupting narrative flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive—soot, salt, and the haunted setting support the nostalgic, mysterious tone. Strong sensory details evoke setting effectively, although the timeframe inclusion feels faint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant with strong symbolism (candlestick, seashell) and layered subtext about tradition vs. progress. However, the abstract tone occasionally clouds clarity and risks distancing the reader.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>There’s originality in the thematic and symbolic construction, but some phrases verge on overwrought ("map to the unknown histories") and risk feeling AI-derived or overly stylized. Emotional nuance is often implicit rather than shown through dynamic action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Despite a dense symbolic layer, the story tightly integrates its elements into a cohesive narrative. The language is mostly purposeful and lyrical, though slightly over-calculated in metaphor density. The closing image is strong and lingering.</comment>
