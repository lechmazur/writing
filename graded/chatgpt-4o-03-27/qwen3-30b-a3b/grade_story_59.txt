<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The troubadourâ€™s internal conflict and emotional evolution are well-developed; his transformation emerges organically through symbolism and action, though he lacks dynamic interaction with others that might deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a satisfying arc with a beginning, midpoint epiphany, and resolution, though the pacing occasionally risks indulgence in atmosphere over momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is powerfully atmospheric, with evocative sensory detail and metaphorical resonance that heightens internal and thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and layered, rich in metaphor and subtext, culminating in a resonant thematic shift; however, it flirts with overwriting in places, which slightly diminishes clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong originality in concept and language, with fresh metaphors and philosophical depth; a few phrases veer toward poetic excess, though emotional nuance feels human and intentional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive with meaningful integration of theme, structure, and language; a rare case where brevity enhances rather than limits the story's emotional and narrative impact.</comment>
