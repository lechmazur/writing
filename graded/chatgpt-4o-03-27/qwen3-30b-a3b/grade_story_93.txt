<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand sacred geometry is present but underdeveloped; emotional stakes exist but her internal arc is vague and lacks depth or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>There's a clear arc with rising tension and resolution, but some transitions (e.g., between radio signal and wall shifting) stretch coherence and feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with strong sensory cues and a mysterious tone; setting supports mood effectively, though remains abstract and under-explored in parts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some fresh ideas and atmospheric tension, but reliance on familiar tropes and vague lyricism reduces originality; writing occasionally veers into formula or purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective in mood and world-building, but lacks the polish, precision, and depth of character or thematic resonance needed for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
