<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The character's motivation is consistent and emotionally resonant, especially the grief tethered to memory, but he remains more symbolic than fully-dimensional; his "frenzy" and internal voice lack intimate specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The void, tea leaves, and pulsing libraries create a surreal, haunting atmosphere that supports the theme of cultural loss; sensory language is often strong though slightly uneven in clarity.</comment>
