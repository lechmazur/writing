<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lila’s character is intriguing and layered, with her motivation tied loosely but thoughtfully to her past and the symbolic button; however, her emotional arc feels compressed and underexplored due to the brevity of the format.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core arc achieves a beginning, middle, and end, but the logic of bypassing town security through time reversal is abstractly handled and underexplained, leaving gaps in narrative causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory detail—burnt herbs, glowing jars, ghost-like ambience—and the setting of the witch’s brewery serves as an effective backdrop for both tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (button, disguise, time) is elegantly handled, and the conclusion is quietly profound, but the emotional stakes and tension remain at a distant, cerebral level rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>There are flashes of original voice and imagery, but a few phrasings verge on generic or overwritten (“the courage of others,” “diabolically benevolent”), diluting authenticity and polish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story demonstrates coherence and thoughtful integration of elements, but lacks the emotional immediacy or stylistic precision to place it among the finest literary short fiction.</comment>
