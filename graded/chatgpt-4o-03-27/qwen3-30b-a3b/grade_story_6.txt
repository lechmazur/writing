<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The minstrel's skepticism informs both tone and decision-making, and his arc from doubt to defiant belief is subtly and convincingly drawn, though some emotional depth feels abbreviated due to word count limitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot builds tension and resolves elegantly within the word limit, with a clear arc and a clever twist, though the deeper logic of "inkâ€™s memory" stretches believability toward the abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The disappearing ink factory is vividly rendered with strong sensory and symbolic detail; atmosphere amplifies the themes of memory and illusion exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story layers metaphor, symbolism (ink, memory, song), and theme with elegance, evoking wonder and reflection; the ending offers resonance well beyond the close of action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subverts common tropes through voice and concept; rich, original metaphors elevate the writing without veering into excess, though one or two phrases brush against poetic indulgence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, conceptually layered, and emotionally satisfying; strong unity of tone, theme, and narrative momentum despite complexity and brevity.</comment>
