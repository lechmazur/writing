<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s arc has emotional depth, but key traits—like his transition from egotism to reluctant guardian—feel underdeveloped and rushed; his motivations shift more by narrative necessity than inner evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conceptual coherence holds, and there’s a satisfying structural arc, but some developments like the illness and masked stranger feel abrupt or overly symbolic, disrupting momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The island’s surreal atmosphere is richly rendered with evocative sensory detail and tone; the buzzing insects, shifting shadows, and pulsing crystal ball effectively heighten narrative mood and mystery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The island’s strangeness and symbolic elements show flashes of originality, but trope-laden aspects—like the masked double and sudden wisdom—border on formula without unexpected subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A thoughtful and poetic piece with strong atmosphere and philosophical undercurrents, but uneven pacing and thematic overreach slightly cloud its impact and polish.</comment>
