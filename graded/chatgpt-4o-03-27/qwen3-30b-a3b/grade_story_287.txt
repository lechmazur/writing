<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias is well-defined through both action and introspection; his stubborn optimism and emotional conflict are clear, though the child is more symbolic than fleshed out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story flows with a graceful internal arc—beginning in uncertainty, evolving toward quiet acceptance—but lacks a strong external plot drive, feeling static in momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a triumph—visually rich, immersive, and thematically resonant; the library and its decay echo the emotional stakes and tone beautifully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking originality and nuance in metaphor and emotional depth; some slightly ornate phrasing walks a fine line but mostly enhances the lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Achieves cohesion and thematic unity with clarity and grace; lacks only a slightly more dynamic arc to push it into unequivocal greatness.</comment>
