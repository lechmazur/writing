<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mercenary’s inner conflict is vivid and authentic; his motivation—emotional closure—is consistent and well-articulated through his reactions. However, more specificity in his backstory would further deepen the character’s arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot fulfills a complete arc, with a beginning, rising tension, and emotional resolution. The pacing is strong, though the reliance on rumor chains as a plot device is underdeveloped and weakens logical causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is rich with sensory texture and deeply tied to the tone and emotional tenor. The juxtaposition of decay and art is poignantly rendered, enhancing the atmosphere and mirroring the character’s internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor, particularly the spider and amber, are well-used and resonant. The emotional arc is poignant, though the story would benefit from subtler execution in a few reflective passages to avoid slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice and emotional nuance are evident, but occasional phrasing edges toward overuse or poetic excess (“slow fade of an echoing hour”) that threatens clarity. Still, it shows a clear authorial hand and is not generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story holds together well as a layered and emotionally satisfying narrative. The momentum is tied to theme rather than external plot, and the closing image resonates. A few elements feel slightly under-integrated.</comment>
