<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The spy has a defined emotional arc and history, but his motivation and internal conflict feel stated rather than shown; character voice lacks emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative maintains momentum and has a clear arc, but the central conflict resolution feels abstract and symbolic, reducing clarity of action-consequence links.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmospheric worldbuilding effectively immerse the reader; the slums are evocative and thematically resonant with the spyâ€™s fragmentation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some inventive symbolism (label, reflections) but overall tone occasionally leans toward overwritten; emotion feels described rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story integrates its elements coherently and with intrigue, but lacks the polish and nuance needed for top-tier publication; moments of brilliance are undercut by vagueness.</comment>
