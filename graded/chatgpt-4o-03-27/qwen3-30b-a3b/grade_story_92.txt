<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is intriguing and consistent—his curiosity compelling—but his personality remains underdeveloped, and we get only surface-level insight into his emotional state or past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure has a clear arc and the pacing is strong, but the blood drive scene feels surreal and abrupt, briefly straining cohesion despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegantly composed and thematically rich, but uneven integration of core elements (esp. blood drive) prevents it from reaching full cohesion or emotional depth.</comment>
