<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s internal conflict and transformation are effectively portrayed, and his motivations are clearly tied to both the mug and storytelling; however, secondary character development and interaction are minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and climactic given the constraints, with an effective twist; transitions feel natural though compressed, and the resolution borders on being too convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Well-crafted within the length, thematically integrated, and emotionally satisfying; feels deliberate rather than constrained, with strong use of core elements.</comment>
