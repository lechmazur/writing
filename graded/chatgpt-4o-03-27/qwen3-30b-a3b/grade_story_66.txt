<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The deserter’s internal journey is nuanced and emotionally consistent, with his motivations (belonging, reinterpretation of silence) woven effectively into his rituals and reflections. His voice is distinct though distant, intentionally subdued.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Though abstract, the structure has a clear arc: from alienation to transformation. Cause-effect logic is subtle but coherent, and the final image resolves the emotional movement. However, some transitions feel metaphorically dense, risking opacity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are exceptionally immersive; details like carbonized leaves and humming roots conjure a tactile, organic mood. The fusion of scientific and spiritual imagery deepens the world without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative, metaphor-rich prose successfully builds a layered narrative, with themes of fragmentation, memory, and reclamation. The ending resonates emotionally and symbolically, though it flirts with vagueness in places.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly original in concept and execution—cracked mirrors, porcelain masks, and plant signals feel freshly interpreted. It avoids clichés, though a few phrases lean toward poetic excess and risk imprecision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves poetic cohesion with thematic depth and stylistic intentionality. Despite its abstract tone, it rewards close reading and lingers conceptually. Rare lapses into murkiness prevent a perfect score.</comment>
