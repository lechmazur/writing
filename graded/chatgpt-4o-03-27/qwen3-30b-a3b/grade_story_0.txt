<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains a tight arc and ends with resolution, but some cause-effect elements feel abstract, and the transition into action is slightly oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ambitious and cohesive with strong thematic development; slight abstraction in parts holds it back from perfection, but overall deeply resonant and structurally sound.</comment>
