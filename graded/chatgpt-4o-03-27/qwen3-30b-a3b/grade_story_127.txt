<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict is powerfully rendered through her relationship with the gauntlet and music; her motivations are consistent and deeply rooted, though the knight remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The progression from creative block to emotional catharsis through song achieves a satisfying narrative arc, though the resolution arrives slightly abruptly and the middle could benefit from more variation in rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge is atmospheric and immersive, with strong sensory detail; the physicality of the rusted gauntlet and coral memory deepens mood and setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic language and symbolic layering (gauntlet, coral, rust) create emotional depth; the final exchange is understated but resonant, though the story verges on overwrought at times.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original in its metaphor and emotional arc, but some phrasing borders on clich√© ("storm in her chest"); however, the fusion of setting and memory is compellingly human and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegantly integrates all core elements with thematic unity and emotional payoff; a few lines feel overly poetic at the cost of clarity, but overall cohesion is strong.</comment>
