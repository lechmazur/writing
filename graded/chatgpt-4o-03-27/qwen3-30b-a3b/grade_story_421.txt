<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict is clear and compellingâ€”her motivations are emotionally resonant and consistent, though her 'voice' remains distant due to lack of direct dialogue or deep idiosyncrasy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tight and coherent with a clear arc, though it leans heavily on exposition over dramatized action; cause and effect are logical and well-paced within the word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A strikingly cohesive whole with layered conflict and theme; while a touch overwritten in places, it leaves a resonant impression and reads like deliberate art, not constraint-driven filler.</comment>
