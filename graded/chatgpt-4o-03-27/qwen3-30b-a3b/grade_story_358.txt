<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story has a strong thematic arc and surreal logic, though transitions between settings (mirror, tomb, greenhouse) can feel disjointedly metaphysical rather than narratively driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original and inventive in execution, especially in metaphor and tone; some phrasing teeters on over-stylized, but overall avoids clich√© with poetic control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere, theme, and literary craft work in concert; minor clarity issues prevent a perfect score, but the story lingers with intellectual and emotional weight.</comment>
