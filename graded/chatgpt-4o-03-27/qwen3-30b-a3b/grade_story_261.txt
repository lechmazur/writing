<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is a vividly drawn, melancholic figure whose motivations align tightly with his immortal burden and past mistakes; his emotional arc is coherent and compelling, but some internal repetition weakens nuance slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a hauntingly cyclical structure tied well to the launch motif, but the resolution remains elusive—intentionally—but slightly blunts narrative closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The world is richly atmospheric, each element—from the garden to the ink—contributing to mood and setting with sensory precision; the integration of experimental ecology with metaphysics is original and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism is dense, emotional undercurrents run deep, and the story lingers—the launch becomes a ritual of grief and futility, though some emotional beats repeat too obviously.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>While language is fresh and largely avoids clichés, a few metaphorical constructions verge on overwrought and risk distancing rather than illuminating the emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive and affecting whole; the tone, imagery, and pacing cohere impressively—minor repetition in phrasing slightly dulls the edge of otherwise stellar craft.</comment>
