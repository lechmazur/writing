<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The character’s obsession and motivations are well aligned with their actions, and their emotional arc is conveyed with intensity; however, the lack of dialogue and limited direct insight into their internal thoughts slightly mutes a fuller psychological portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and satisfying narrative resolution within tight constraints; however, transitions between the diary’s content, the past events, and the present act of rewriting are occasionally abstract, leaving minor ambiguity in cause-effect flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly original and atmospheric, with strong sensory evocation and thematic resonance; the whisper collection point, diaries, and night enhance tone and mood excellently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story is deeply symbolic and emotionally resonant, with a strong conceptual spine and elegant style; however, it leans slightly more abstract than visceral, leaving certain emotional beats less grounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wholly original in concept and metaphor, with a surreal yet human touch that avoids predictability or formulaic structure; prose is lyrical but controlled, though a few moments verge on over-stylization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, inventive, and meaningful; all major elements serve the theme, though the ambiguity of the character’s transformation could be sharpened for greater emotional impact.</comment>
