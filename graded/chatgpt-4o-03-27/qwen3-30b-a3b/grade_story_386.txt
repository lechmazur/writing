<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The refugee’s actions and motivations clearly connect with their status as a displaced figure, and their emotional depth is conveyed through physical gestures and symbolic interaction with the tablecloth; however, the “trustworthy strange” trait is more implied than explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot arcs effectively from stasis to transformation, with strong internal logic and cause-effect progression centered around the celestial alignment and catapult; pacing is controlled but slightly abstracted in resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric details—atomic light, whispering ghosts, tactile embroidery—are vivid and cohesive, creating a hypnotic sense of melancholy and otherworldliness that supports the narrative’s emotional tone.</comment>
