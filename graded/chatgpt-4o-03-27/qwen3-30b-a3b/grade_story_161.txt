<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchardist is well-drawn, with clear motivation tied to grief and introspection; his evolution from skeptic to believer is thoughtfully executed and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a compact yet coherent arc; while the conspiracy element stretches believability slightly, it is internally consistent and leads to a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and well-established—sounds, textures, and imagery of plumage and machinery enrich the story’s emotional and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrent, layered symbolism (seal/feathers), and a sharp tonal control; ending is impactful without over-explaining, though the pacing flirts with abruptness in parts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This is a fresh and nuanced take on conspiracy entwined with grief; metaphors are thematically apt, and emotion is shown rather than told for the most part.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Excellent craft and cohesion with strong integration of elements; slightly over-packed by the end but never loses narrative clarity or thematic depth.</comment>
