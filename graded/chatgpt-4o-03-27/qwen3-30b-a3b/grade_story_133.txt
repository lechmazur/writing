<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith’s internal conflict is deeply woven into his interactions and reflections, revealing emotional stagnation and eventual transformation; however, his motivation shift could benefit from slightly clearer grounding earlier in the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves an arc of transformation and thematic closure, but the narrative progression—especially the orchard climax—relies heavily on symbolic resonance rather than concrete causality, slightly weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with multisensory detail—the rain-soaked thyme, chipped porcelain, and clawing trees all immerse the reader and enhance the emotional tone of disquiet and rediscovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegant use of symbolism throughout—the throne, gloves, keys—delivers a layered existential meditation; the emotional arc is subtle but compelling, though the storytelling occasionally leans toward abstraction over clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Core imagery and metaphors are fresh and specific, but a few flourishes verge on self-conscious literary affectation; some emotional shifts feel slightly engineered or ambiguous in motivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story is conceptually ambitious and emotionally resonant, with a unified tone and symbolic throughline, though some abstraction and poetic density slightly obscure narrative clarity on first read.</comment>
