<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira is well-developed through consistent motivation, symbolic behaviors, and a compelling internal logic; her telepathy and barista role inform her emotional connection to others and elevate her quietly rebellious persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a complete progression within the word limit, though pacing stalls slightly mid-story as symbolic elements temporarily overshadow causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and richly textured—specific sensory details like the dock’s hum and burnt coffee evoke setting effectively, and the tone aligns with Mira’s introspective mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subtext and metaphor are handled with skill, particularly the symbolism of the button hook and cloak; minor deductions for lack of dramatic tension or external conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Though bordering on lyrical excess at times, the story avoids cliché and presents a fresh conceptual blend; metaphors are largely original but occasionally verge on ornamental rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A strong, cohesive piece that uses its elements in service of a quietly profound theme; not flawless, but certainly above the threshold for top-tier consideration.</comment>
