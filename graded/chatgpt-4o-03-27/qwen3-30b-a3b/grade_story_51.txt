<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jax’s arc is clearly motivated by guilt and a desire for redemption, and his internal conflict is nuanced and consistent; his actions (like keeping the crate slat) reinforce his struggle, though the woman’s role could be deepened to better mirror his change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and emotional progression, with a strong opening and a satisfying resolution; however, the pacing around the woman's appearance feels slightly rushed, and the transition into confrontation could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The static electricity garden is original and atmospheric, supporting the protagonist's tension and internal transformation; sensory details and tone are well-matched to the character’s emotional state.</comment>
