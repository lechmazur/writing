<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bard's hesitation and grief are well-portrayed through his actions and connection to the plush; however, his motivation is more emotionally implied than explicitly articulated across the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure follows a satisfying emotional arc with a resonant resolution, though the "dream-hopping" and machine mechanics are underdeveloped and abstracted, slightly weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is poetic yet controlled, mostly avoiding cliché; a few metaphors verge on overwritten, but overall originality and voice remain strong and authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story demonstrates literary merit with emotional depth, lyrical craft, and a complete arc—the dream mechanics could use clarification, but narrative impact remains potent.</comment>
