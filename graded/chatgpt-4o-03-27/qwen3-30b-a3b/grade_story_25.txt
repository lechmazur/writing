<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mariner is distinct and motivated, with his cold intensity and haunted past compellingly revealed through his actions and reflections; however, emotional evolution feels somewhat static across the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot arc is mostly coherent with a strong resolution, but transitions between the forest scenes and theater audience are abrupt and require more connective tissue to fully land.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly realized with rich sensory detail and strong symbolic resonance; atmosphere is immersive and thematically aligned with the mariner’s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Striking imagery, poetic rhythm, and layered symbolism enhance emotional and thematic depth, though the dual narrative (forest and theater) occasionally competes for focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Language is often rich and original, though at times overwrought; the piece avoids clichés, but some phrasing veers toward ornamental excess that slightly dulls impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive, thought-provoking, and emotionally resonant; though some elements feel slightly more decorative than essential, the story's ambition and execution are impressive overall.</comment>
