<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The knight’s transformation is subtle yet emotionally effective; his cold nature contrasts well with the mitten’s warmth, but his lawfully rebellious trait is underdeveloped and mostly implied rather than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a full arc with a compelling internal shift, though the initial mission to collect folk remedies feels loosely tied to the climax, and some transitions feel overly poetic at the cost of clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details—lavender, pine, cold air—strongly immerse the reader, and the world’s decayed magic subtly reinforces the emotional thaw, though the “secret agent center” feels incongruent and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Poetic prose, strong symbolism, and a quiet emotional punch elevate the storytelling, though thematic clarity occasionally gets murky under the stylized language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mitten-as-symbol is fresh and well-drawn, but certain phrasings tip into lyrical excess or abstraction; emotional nuance is present but occasionally over-articulated rather than embedded in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and emotionally resonant; most elements align well to support theme and arc, though some assignments (like the setting) feel pasted on rather than integral.</comment>
