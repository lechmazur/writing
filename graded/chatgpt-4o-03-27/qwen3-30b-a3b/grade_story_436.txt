<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The apothecary’s sorrow and motivation to restore her family’s legacy are clearly conveyed, but her emotional progression is relatively static and lacks nuanced development across the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying arc and emotional crescendo within the word count, though the transition between decoding dream catchers and confronting the oracle feels rushed and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is rich and atmospheric, with strong sensory detail—especially in the library, desert, and fortress—but some elements (e.g., the dream catchers’ mechanics) remain vaguely symbolic rather than fully grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story delivers strong emotional resonance and vibrant symbolic imagery, though certain metaphors (e.g., sigh of a dying star) verge on overwrought and risk diluting subtlety with grandeur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché and demonstrates originality in its execution, though there are occasional flourishes of language that feel slightly manufactured and pull from the emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Despite minor lapses in clarity and overreliance on poetic abstraction, the piece achieves cohesion, thematic resonance, and a memorable emotional tone that elevate its impact.</comment>
