<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bartender is vividly drawn—his jaded demeanor, obsessive rituals, and conflicted relationship with the scalpel convey a layered psychological portrait; his motivation to decode the past through irrational means is compelling and consistently rendered.</comment>
