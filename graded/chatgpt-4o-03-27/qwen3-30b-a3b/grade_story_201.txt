<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s impulsiveness and whimsical nature are clear and consistent, with her motivation emotionally intuitive if not fully articulated; slightly vague inner conflict keeps it from top marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arc is satisfying and well-paced for the word limit, with a coherent structure and a clear climax, though the leap from the music to unlocking a supernatural gate strains logic slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A strong, cohesive piece with a creative concept and emotional valence; the story lingers, though slightly derivative fantasy motifs prevent it from full distinction.</comment>
