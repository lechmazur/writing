<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena is sharply drawn with layered contradictions—ruthless yet polite, emotionally resistant yet sensitive to symbolism—but the stranger’s vagueness detracts from full character dynamism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story maintains a steady arc and concludes meaningfully, though the pacing around the revelation feels mildly rushed and the ending slightly esoteric.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is immersive and symbolically resonant; the stone circle, singer’s pauses, and wind-blown petals create a vivid, haunting atmosphere enhancing theme and tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtle emotional depth; the comb becomes potent symbolism, and dialogue is poetic yet charged—though the resolution flirts with opaqueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is mostly distinct, and metaphors are fresh, though occasional vagueness and slightly self-conscious phrasing hint at a crafted rather than lived-in voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Highly cohesive and evocative; elements feel organically entwined, and the story lingers emotionally. The execution flirts with excellence but lacks a final surge of clarity or originality.</comment>
