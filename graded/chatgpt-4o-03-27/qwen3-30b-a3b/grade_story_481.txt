<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cartographer’s motivations are poetic and consistent, with her perceptiveness tied to the dragonfly and map metaphor; however, her emotional arc could have had greater specificity beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The plot maintains a coherent internal logic and resolution, but the pacing in the middle briefly falters around the blacksmith scene, which risks thematic abstraction over narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and layered images show nuance and depth; a few phrases verge on over-stylization, but overall, the writing avoids cliché and demonstrates a distinct authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Deeply imaginative fusion of setting, mood, and theme; cohesion is high, and although the story leans on allegory, it achieves resonance and originality without feeling formulaic.</comment>
