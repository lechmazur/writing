<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a coherent arc and a sense of resolution, but the pacing is languid and the action lacks urgency, making the plot feel more atmospheric than driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the prose is lyrical, it occasionally veers into purple territory and leans on abstract phrasing; some metaphors feel generic or overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its impact is muted by a lack of narrative tension and overreliance on poetic abstraction.</comment>
