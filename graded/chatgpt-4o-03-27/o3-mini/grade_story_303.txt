<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arden and Mira are intriguing, but their motivations—especially Arden’s—are more poetic than psychologically grounded; emotional depth is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story flows lyrically but lacks a clear arc; events feel more like a montage of moods than a structured narrative with rising tension or resolution.</comment>
