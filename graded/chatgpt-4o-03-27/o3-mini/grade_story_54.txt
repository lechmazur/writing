<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian’s personality is sketched with poetic flair, but his motivations—while stated—lack emotional grounding or evolution; his voice is distant, more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The plot is more atmospheric than event-driven; while there’s a sense of movement, the arc is abstract and lacks a clear turning point or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and immersive, with strong sensory detail and mood; however, its connection to the character’s purpose feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and evocative, but the emotional impact is dulled by abstraction and repetition; the story gestures at depth without fully delivering it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>While the language is ornate, it often veers into purple prose; metaphors are occasionally overwrought, and the narrative voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive in tone and style, but the elements feel layered on rather than organically integrated; it leaves an impression, but not a lasting one.</comment>
