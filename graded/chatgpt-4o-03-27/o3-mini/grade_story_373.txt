<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While the language is often original, it occasionally lapses into purple prose and abstract phrasing; some metaphors feel forced, and the emotional nuance is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is conceptually ambitious and stylistically bold, but its cohesion suffers from a lack of narrative clarity and emotional grounding; it intrigues more than it satisfies.</comment>
