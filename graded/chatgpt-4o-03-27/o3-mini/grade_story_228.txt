<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clearly rooted in her past and symbolized through the clothespin, but her emotional depth and evolution remain somewhat static despite evocative prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story has a thematic arc, but the plot lacks concrete events or turning points; the storm and bunker exploration feel more symbolic than narratively functional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its emotional and narrative stakes remain too subdued for top-tier literary publication.</comment>
