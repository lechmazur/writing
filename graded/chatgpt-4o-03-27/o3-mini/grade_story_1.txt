<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and phrasing, but the prose veers into purple territory and occasionally feels algorithmic, with vague or recycled imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive in tone and theme, but the execution lacks clarity and narrative precision; it feels more like a mood piece than a fully realized story.</comment>
