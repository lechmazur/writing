<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amelia’s motivation is clearly articulated and emotionally resonant, and her personality—elegantly clumsy yet determined—shapes her actions meaningfully; however, her voice lacks some distinctiveness and dialogue is absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent arc and thematic unity, but the plot progression is more meditative than dynamic, with minimal external conflict or escalation, which slightly limits narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined and atmospherically rendered, with strong sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the sand castle lab and spectral elements are deeply intertwined with tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (e.g., flower crown, silence), and the story evokes reflection, but the lack of dialogue and external tension slightly mutes emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the prose avoids clichés and shows stylistic control, some phrasing veers toward the ornate, and the narrative occasionally leans on abstraction over specificity, reducing emotional texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically rich, with creative integration of elements; however, it leans more toward lyrical meditation than narrative propulsion, which may limit broader appeal.</comment>
