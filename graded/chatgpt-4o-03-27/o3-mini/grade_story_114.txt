<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The summoner’s apathetic yet quietly determined nature is intriguing, but his motivation to restore coral reefs feels abstract and underdeveloped; emotional depth is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a poetic arc and thematic cohesion, but lacks a clear narrative progression; the action of “unfolding” is metaphorical and doesn’t drive a tangible plot forward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and thematically unified, but its abstract nature and lack of narrative tension reduce its overall resonance; conceptually rich but emotionally distant.</comment>
