<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The conjurer’s motivations are present but obscured by abstract language; her personality lacks specificity, and the emotional arc feels more symbolic than grounded in character psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story has a beginning and end, but the middle lacks clear progression; the plot is more atmospheric than event-driven, with cause-effect relationships implied rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is richly imagined with strong sensory and conceptual detail; the embassy and alien elements enhance the mystical tone and support the character’s arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>There’s thematic ambition and poetic language, but the emotional impact is dulled by abstraction and lack of concrete stakes or conflict; symbolism is present but not always earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Some originality in concept and tone, but the prose veers into purple territory; metaphors are occasionally overwrought, and emotional nuance is often told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and stylistically consistent, but its depth is more suggested than realized; it leaves an impression, but not a lasting emotional or intellectual resonance.</comment>
