<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias is richly sketched with clear motivations rooted in fear, foresight, and control; his voice and behavior are distinct, and his interactions with Kael reveal internal conflict and depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc has a compelling structure with setup, development, and climax; the pruning metaphor carries through, though Kael's dismissal resolves a bit quickly given its dramatic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The oppressive, twilight-drenched orchard under solar panels is vivid and thematically resonant; sensory descriptions and atmosphere powerfully serve both tone and character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor and subtext (maps, pruning, poison); the narrative shows more than tells and evokes a powerful, lingering sense of bittersweet inevitability; highly memorable storytelling voice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Writing style is original and evocative; emotional nuance is handled with care and subtlety; the piece avoids formulaic structures and offers a unique conceptual blend; metaphors are fresh and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The piece is cohesive, multilayered, and emotionally resonant; its brevity feels intentional, not restrictive; the elements feel organic and artistically fused into a greater thematic arc.</comment>
