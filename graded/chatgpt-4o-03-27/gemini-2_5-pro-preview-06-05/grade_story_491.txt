<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s motivations are consistent and subtly revealed through actions and sensory focus; his serenity, determination, and eventual understanding create a coherent emotional arc, though he could use sharper, more individuated characterization beyond quiet reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story achieves a complete arc with clear rising action, climax, and resolution, elegantly using the unraveling quilt to drive the plot; however, the pacing risks languor in parts due to its meditative tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sensory immersion is exceptional—scent, light, and silence all serve both atmosphere and theme, with the greenhouse and extinct plants deeply entwined with the story’s conceptual core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphor and layered symbolism elevate the narrative, especially the quilt-as-text illusion; the ending resonates emotionally, though the internal conflict is subtle rather than dramatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original use of elements with few signs of formula; metaphors are vivid and specific, and the emotional nuance, especially the understated transformation, suggests careful authorship rather than algorithmic assembly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story is cohesive, thematically elegant, and stylistically deliberate; though abstract in moments, it leaves a memorably gentle yet profound impression appropriate to its concept.</comment>
