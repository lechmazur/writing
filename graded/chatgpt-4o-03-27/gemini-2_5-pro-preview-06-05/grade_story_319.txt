<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s motivation—to escape a life he was never meant for—is clear, emotionally resonant, and consistent with his actions; his wavering fear juxtaposed with moments of decisive courage deepens his character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story follows a tight arc: beginning with internal conflict, escalating to action, and resolving with escape; the pacing is well-managed and cause-effect relationships remain coherent despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal island, with its retreating sea and ritualistic markings, is richly atmospheric; sensory imagery (sea wind, sour phial, bark textures) effectively enhances mood and mirrors the themes of fate and freedom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emotionally charged narrative is layered with symbolism (painted skin as fate); the resolution is cathartic and thematically potent, and the prose contains well-chosen imagery without excess sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story subverts the sorting trope with a nuanced, human motive and avoids AI tell-tale generic phrasing; metaphors are specific and the tone is controlled, though the bark-message method felt underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Despite several required elements, the narrative feels organic and cohesive; the emotional trajectory is grounded in character, and the ending leaves a lingering mood that elevates the piece beyond its constraints.</comment>
