<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias is richly layered—his loss of faith, quiet obsession, and transformation are subtly but effectively conveyed through his actions and inner focus; his motivation is vivid, if enigmatic, and consistent from beginning to end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The progression from desolate wandering to epiphany via the mysterious piano forms a coherent arc; the climax is resonant, though the concealment subplot is underdeveloped and might leave some questions unanswered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant, metaphorically rich, and thematically complex, the story balances surrealism with psychological depth; the butterfly as a motif is powerful and the ending lingers with significance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive and atmospheric with fresh imagery and symbolism; a few phrases risk over-poeticizing, but overall the language avoids cliché and has a distinctive, purposeful voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements feed a unified artistic vision, and the short length feels masterfully controlled rather than limiting; the story leaves an indelible impression and a sense of spiritual and existential unease.</comment>
