<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Iris's personality—controlled, obsessive, subtly emotive—is drawn through precise actions and metaphors (e.g., pruning like rose care). Her motivation is clear, layered, and consistent throughout, culminating in a powerful character insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot arc—discovery through desecration, revelation of sorrow, acceptance of burden—progresses coherently and deliberately within the short space. The pacing is well-controlled, though the resolution slightly leans into poetic ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with detailed sensory input (damp jeans, silent stones, singer's voice) harmonizing with the character’s emotional state and the story’s thematic gravity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Impressive emotional resonance and thematic complexity—grief, obsession, and inheritance of knowledge blend through symbols and metaphor. The ending lingers, effective without overstatement. Minor abstraction may lose some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While poetic and original, a few moments verge on ornate. Still, the language is largely fresh and evocatively precise. Avoids clichés and integrates metaphor meaningfully, though “watcher’s burden” skirts abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Beautifully cohesive and emotionally complex. All elements serve a greater thematic vision. Despite potential for metaphorical overload, the craftsmanship and style sustain clarity and impact.</comment>
