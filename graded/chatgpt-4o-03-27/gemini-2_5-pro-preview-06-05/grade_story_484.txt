<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alistair’s personality is distinct and consistent, with his dry humor and weary conviction well-aligned to his motivations. His role as a brewer metaphorically enriches his methodical and grounded approach, though his transformation arc feels a bit understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc with effective pacing. The action of cleansing the rot is logically driven and resolved within the word limit, with strong cause-and-effect progression. The climax ties back to the protest, completing the loop effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted mansion’s oppressive atmosphere is richly conveyed through sensory detail and metaphor. The setting amplifies the story’s tension and supports Alistair’s internal and external conflicts. The mood lingers effectively throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tone is skillfully managed, merging flippancy with solemnity. The mirror as a symbol and the cleansing act as metaphor are well-executed. The story subtly explores agency, decay, and resistance, though some depth could still be expanded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story avoids cliché with fresh imagery and original phrasing. The tone and metaphors feel human, not automated. It leans stylistic without purple prose and shows emotional nuance, though a couple lines flirt with overused gothic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between elements and a satisfying conclusion. The narrative feels deliberately constructed rather than checklist-driven and lingers with thematic weight. Slight expansions could elevate it to near-perfection.</comment>
