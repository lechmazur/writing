<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The character’s motivation—to instill empathy through dangerous knowledge—is clearly conveyed and emotionally compelling; her transformation from archer to seeker is symbolically rich, though more dialogue or memory might deepen her psychological texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story’s arc is tight and cohesive, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; the symbolic descent of the paper airplane elegantly underscores the narrative beats, though the climactic moment’s mechanics remain slightly opaque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and hauntingly rendered; the decaying colosseum beneath a forgotten amusement park is both surreal and grounded, anchoring the quest and reinforcing thematic unity exceptionally well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is emotionally resonant and thematically rich, with strong symbolic imagery (bent fork, leaves, paper airplane), though a slight lack of specificity in the final resonance leaves the ending just shy of fully cathartic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and inventive elements (e.g., fork as lens) elevate the originality; however, some lines edge toward poetic excess, occasionally risking clarity for style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic integration and lyrical prose create a lingering impact; minor ambiguity around the mechanics of the final ritual slightly dulls its narrative weight, but the whole is greater than the parts.</comment>
