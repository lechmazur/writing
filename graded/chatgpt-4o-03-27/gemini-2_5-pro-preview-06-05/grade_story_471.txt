<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael is vividly rendered with internal conflict and layered motivations; his evolution from reckless explorer to someone seeking emotional redemption is believable and earned, though Elara’s absence from the scene limits the emotional punch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc is complete and satisfying within the word count, culminating in a meaningful decision; however, the street musician interlude briefly slows narrative momentum and risks thematic overexplanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A cohesive, emotionally intelligent narrative with a strong thematic spine and resonant imagery; it elevates familiar tropes through introspective depth and compelling style.</comment>
