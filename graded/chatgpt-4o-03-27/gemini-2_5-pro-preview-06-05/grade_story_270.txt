<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is strong and distinct, with motivation clearly rooted in obsession and isolation; their actions align with a deep yearning to connect through memory and sound, though the emotional progression remains somewhat static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a compelling arc within the word count, with a clear build to a climax and a poignant, unresolved resolution; however, the pacing slightly lingers in introspection, risking an overly meditative tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is powerfully rendered with vivid sensory detail—dust, ozone, moonlight—and the setting (a decaying lighthouse laboratory) deepens both tone and theme masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Haunting and poetic, the narrative's lyrical style enhances a unique voice; though emotionally resonant and layered with subtext, the final beat leans familiar rather than transcendent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original imagery and language choices avoid cliché; metaphors are fresh and thematically apt, though a few sentences flirt with purple prose without tipping into it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cohesive, atmospheric, and deeply reflective, the story lingers with the reader; a near-perfect fusion of concept and execution, though its conceptual density might slightly limit immediate accessibility.</comment>
