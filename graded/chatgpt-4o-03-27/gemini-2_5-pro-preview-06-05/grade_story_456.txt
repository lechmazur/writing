<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly articulated and consistently reflected in her actions and transformation; her shift from rigid beliefs toward accepting complexity is convincingly portrayed, though her internal voice could be slightly more distinctive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative has a clear arc with effective pacing and resolution, though the middle lacks dynamic tension; the method and motivation logically drive the structure but could benefit from one more turn or complication to enhance momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with strong sensory detail; the floating dojo, darkness, and candlelight powerfully reinforce tone and theme, though the surreal setting might feel slightly underdeveloped for some readers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is contemplative and layered, with elegant prose and rich symbolism; the compost metaphor and narrative shift feel earned, though emotional engagement could deepen with more visceral stakes or contrast earlier in the piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylistically polished with some fresh, lyrical phrasings and subverted metaphors; the voice is mostly consistent and avoids clich√©, but there are moments of overly formal diction and faint hints of thematic overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates narrative cohesion, a distinct philosophical voice, and a striking final image; it feels intentionally compact rather than constrained, though a touch more unpredictability would elevate it further.</comment>
