<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice is distinct, bitter, and precise. His orchardist past elegantly mirrors his analytical unraveling of complex systems. Motivation is clear, though Finch's character is underdeveloped and serves mainly as a foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arc is tight and self-contained, with a clear climax (the demonstration) and thematic resolution. The plot progression is clean and driven by cause-effect logic tied to character motive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sterile drone hangar contrasts well with the natural, organic reference of the peacock and orchard, creating atmospheric unease. Sensory language is evocative, though not deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphor, strong central conflict, and a chilling demonstration create high thematic and emotional impact. The writing is sharply crafted, with layered symbolism. Slight lack of nuance in Finch’s role prevents perfection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original imagery (peacock-based encryption) and character concept. While stylized, the prose is not purple. A few slightly ornate lines verge on overwriting but remain mostly controlled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An elegant and tightly woven piece that balances theme, character, and concept. Hauntingly satisfying ending, minimal fat, and strong literary heft. Small missed opportunities in supporting character and setting unity.</comment>
