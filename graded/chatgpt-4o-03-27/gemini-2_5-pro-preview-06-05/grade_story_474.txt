<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is well-realized with a clear arc from haunted messenger to active agent; his motivation to redeem past trauma rings true and drives his choices effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story flows logically with a compact but satisfying arc, though the spirit’s abrupt contradictory message could have used more setup earlier for full impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric language and structure are mostly fresh and integrated, though some elements (e.g., the cooking class backstory) risk feeling slightly symbolic rather than lived-in.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive, emotionally resonant, and thematically layered; though slightly compressed in places, the story coalesces with purpose and craft rare in brief fiction.</comment>
