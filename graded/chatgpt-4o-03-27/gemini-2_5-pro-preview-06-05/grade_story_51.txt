<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leo's arc is compelling and psychologically nuanced; his motivation is consistent and evolves organically, especially in how he seeks transformation through observation, though a more vivid sense of voice would elevate it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative achieves a full emotional arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end; pacing is effective, though some transitions (e.g., from backstory to final realization) could be more fluid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The atmospheric details—especially the tactile and auditory cues—are evocative, but the static electricity garden feels slightly underused as a setting integral to theme or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional control of tone, symbolism (e.g., the crate slat), and emotional resonance; the final gesture is powerful yet understated, though slightly more specificity in some metaphors could refine the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and shows a strong authorial voice; metaphors are mostly original and effective, with only occasional lapses into style over substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and emotionally resonant, integrating its elements purposefully; it lingers in thought, though minor imbalances in the weight of certain elements prevent a perfect score.</comment>
