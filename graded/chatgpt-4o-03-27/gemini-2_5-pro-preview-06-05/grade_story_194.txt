<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Finn’s transformation is emotionally resonant and credibly motivated; his internal conflict, evolution from brute force to healer, and complex dynamic with the owner are sharply rendered and consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and cause-effect logic, skillfully using brevity to maintain momentum—though some transitions (e.g., future war revelation) feel faintly rushed under the high concept’s weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive; the ossuary restaurant, tactile sensory details, and dream sequences effectively embed the reader without dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Literary devices are well-employed—symbolism, layered themes of healing and reconstruction, and a satisfying reveal—but some emotional beats are slightly underdeveloped due to space constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original blend of grim futurism, arcane medicine, and poetic transformation; metaphors are fresh, and complex emotional nuance is conveyed with stylistic restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cohesive, inventive, and emotionally compelling; the high concept is well-integrated into a character-driven arc that leaves a haunting aftertaste and thematic depth.</comment>
