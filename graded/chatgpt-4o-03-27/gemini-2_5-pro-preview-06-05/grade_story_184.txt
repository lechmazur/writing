<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Finn has a clear voice and unexpected depth; his resigned sarcasm and cosmic fatigue ring true, though more backstory or internal conflict could elevate his motives further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot arc is intentionally absurd yet coherent, though the resolution feels more thematic than narrative—suggesting ideas rather than resolving a tangible conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice and imaginative worldbuilding avoid clichés and generic phrasing—tone, metaphor, and structure all feel authorial rather than synthetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>This piece achieves philosophical resonance and tonal consistency despite its brevity; some may find its lack of traditional resolution unsatisfying, but it's thematically robust.</comment>
