<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo is sharply drawn with emotional nuance; his motivation—regret and eventual acceptance—unfolds believably through his actions and reactions. His voice is distinct, though arguably underexplored for such an introspective narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot achieves a satisfying emotional arc within the word limit, anchored by a strong central moment. The "rewind" is powerfully literal and metaphorical, though minor transitions verge on lyrical abstraction that can blur coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sterile, automated postal facility is sharply contrasted with Leo’s emotional turbulence, creating a resonant atmosphere. Specific sensory details elevate mood, though a touch more grounding could further heighten immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional prose craft—layered metaphor, emotional texture, and thematic elegance. The story "shows" without excess, leaving a lingering reflection on memory, pain, and absurdity. Only minor nit is slightly strained symbolism in a few lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story deftly avoids clichés, offering a unique intersection of setting and tone. While some imagery edges toward overwrought, the voice is strong and human, not mechanical or templated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels complete, with all elements serving the emotional arc. Its brevity feels deliberate rather than constrained, and it leaves an emotional aftertaste—regret twisted into acceptance—worthy of literary attention.</comment>
