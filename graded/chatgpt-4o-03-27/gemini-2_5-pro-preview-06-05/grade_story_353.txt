<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a compelling character with clear, emotionally grounded motivation; the transformation from baker to temporal rebel is believable and thematically rich, though his voice could be more distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structurally elegant with a clear arc and strong causality; the only slight weakness is the rapid resolution, which could have used one more beat for full impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is deeply immersive with rich sensory detail; the melding of setting, object, and tone is seamless and evocative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally original blend of metaphor and speculative concept; avoids clich√© and maintains a consistent, elegant tone with fresh imagery and emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A cohesive, resonant piece that lingers emotionally and intellectually; a few lines verge on florid, but overall a standout flash fiction.</comment>
