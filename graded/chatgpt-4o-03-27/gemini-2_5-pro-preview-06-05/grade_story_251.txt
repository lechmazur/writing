<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is powerfully articulated and consistent with her prophetic nature; her emotional complexity—tired prophet seeking chaos—is rich and compelling but could benefit from slightly more nuance in her voice or direct interaction with others for depth.</comment>
