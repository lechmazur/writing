<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelan’s weary sense of duty is well-established and convincingly challenged by the more nuanced repair task; his arc feels authentic, though the tech’s character lacks similar depth or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>There is a satisfying narrative arc with rising tension, a pivotal shift in method, and resolution; pacing is excellent, though the climax leans slightly on exposition via dialogue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with well-handled contrasts of scale and sensory detail that heighten mood and reflect the larger themes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegantly composed and thematically unified; no element feels extraneous. The narrative lingers with emotional and intellectual weight, despite brevity.</comment>
