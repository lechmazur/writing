<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motivations are clear and deeply tied to his internal state; his evolution from fearful escapee to accidental savior feels earned, though secondary traits beyond dread and resignation are underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong, with a clear beginning, middle, and end; pacing is well-controlled for the word limit, and cause-effect links are logical and satisfying, though setup verges on exposition-heavy early on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative and immersive with elegant sensory detail; the setting—both physical and emotional—amplifies the character’s despair and resolution beautifully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Impactful and introspective with strong symbolic resonance; the reversal premise and metaphysical mechanics are engaging, though some lines teeter on being overly declarative rather than evocative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly cohesive with creative element integration and a haunting resolution; the story lingers with emotional weight and thematic unity, though not quite flawless in balance of voice and depth.</comment>
