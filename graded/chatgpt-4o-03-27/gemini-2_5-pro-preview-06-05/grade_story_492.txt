<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's character is compellingly portrayed with consistent motivation, a distinct voice, and believable internal conflict; his aversion to being a catalyst is nuanced and supported by symbolic objects and action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is exceptionally vivid, with multisensory detail enriching the cyberpunk setting; the grimy physical world mirrors the thematic decay of society and enhances mood and motivation.</comment>
