<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Alistair’s characterization is distinct, with reincarnation, guilt, and his fierce challenge of tradition shaping his choices; his motivation is consistent and compelling, though the “goldfish therapist” identity is underutilized and tonally displaced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a clear arc within its constraints, with a solid beginning, escalation, and a hopeful resolution; the logic of his actions and the progression are mostly coherent, if slightly rushed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vividly atmospheric and symbolic—the forgotten recipe library with ghost-laden air enhances the themes of buried knowledge and tradition; sensory details like dust, rain, and darkness are evocative and well-integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The writing shows impressive control of tone, resonance, metaphor, and emotional undercurrents; the soldier as a symbol of past failure is poignant, and the dialogue is sharp and purposeful—though some imagery veers toward overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storytelling feels mostly original and avoids clichés, with fresh metaphors ("ghosts of bad cooking") and layered meaning; “goldfish therapist” and “Napoleonic medic” are intriguing but feel like clever flourishes rather than deeply rooted elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A strong synthesis of voice, theme, and emotional resonance creates a cohesive and memorable story; while not flawless, it’s inventive and lingers in the mind—the goldfish detail being the most extraneous element.</comment>
