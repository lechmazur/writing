<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in execution—tropes like "brain in a jar" and "duplicate" are used with surprising freshness; writing has a consistent, restrained style free of cliché or purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and polished; the story blends its elements with precision, anchored by tone and character psychology—ambiguous yet emotionally resonant ending adds to its literary weight.</comment>
