<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is a compelling figure—his origin, disguise, and actions reflect a clear, consistent motivation. His gentle demeanor contrasts with his mysterious past, which adds depth. However, the station crew remains too lightly sketched to provide counterbalance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc from ghost stories to Elias's ethereal influence gives the piece a graceful curve. Cause and effect are subtle but coherent. The resolution is understated but satisfying. Some middle transitions could flow more organically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is beautifully rendered; the sterile station contrasts with Elias’s organic attunement. Sensory details—the hum of machines, the shadow-wing—evoke a vivid, immersive world. The tone is consistent and rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The metaphorical layering—cloud manipulation as artistic resistance—is striking. The prose is elegant yet controlled, with strong subtext. The ending resonates. A minor drawback is slightly abstracted emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Despite bordering on lyrical excess, the story avoids cliché and feels uniquely voiced. The metaphor of cloud shadows and the idea of tuning nature are inventive and elegant—fresh rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, not constrained by length. The elements integrate naturally, and the narrative leaves a quietly haunting impression. Minor characters could have offered more grounding.</comment>
