<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris is clearly defined, with his intellect, aesthetic, and ideals all contributing organically to his motivation and action; his internal logic is consistent and his quiet resolve is convincing, though his emotional depth remains slightly surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story presents a satisfyingly complete arc with strong cause-effect progression; the action unfolds logically and within the constraints of the word count, though the colony’s shift in attitude feels slightly abrupt given the scale of their reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is sensuous, cohesive, and supports mood and theme beautifully—glowing sands and ephemeral light become metaphors; worldbuilding is elegant and immersive without overexposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emotional resonance and symbolism are finely tuned, especially in the use of ephemeral art as protest; while the prose is mostly refined, the central conflict resolves a bit too neatly, slightly undercutting complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh, the conceit original, and emotion is shown through action and mood rather than stated; however, the doll’s symbolism, though apt, flirts with over-obviousness, and there is mild tonal uniformity in phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly written and thematically unified, the story combines style and substance with restraint; its brevity feels deliberate, but some moral consequences are softened for narrative resolution.</comment>
