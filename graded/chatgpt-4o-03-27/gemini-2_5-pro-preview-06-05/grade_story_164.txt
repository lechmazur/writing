<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is elegantly compact, with a satisfying progression from contemplation to action; still, the climax (the glitching vine) is too brief to fully land its impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly executed with thematic cohesion and emotional undercurrent; feels like a deliberate fragment of a greater whole, but lingers with poignancy.</comment>
