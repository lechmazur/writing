<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent, elegantly absurd, and surprisingly tight given its scope; the progression is logical, and the buildup toward cosmic rebellion via a taxi ride feels both playful and purposeful, though resolution remains more conceptual than concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Immersive and richly atmospheric, the world is conveyed through vivid sensory details and imaginative fusion of sci-fi and mythic elements; the rain, synth-wool, and dying-star eyes contribute beautifully to mood and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storytelling is confident, poetic, and filled with thematic depth; the dialogue is sharp, and metaphors (e.g. collapsing galaxy) elevate the stakes, though the subtext could benefit from slightly more grounding in emotional consequence.</comment>
