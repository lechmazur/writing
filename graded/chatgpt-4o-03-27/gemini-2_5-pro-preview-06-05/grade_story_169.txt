<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator possesses a distinct and developed voice—enigmatic, reflective, and persuasive. Motivation (preservation of forgotten songs) is layered beneath the transactional role, consistent and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot unfolds smoothly and achieves a complete arc—presentation, persuasion, resolution—with logical cause-effect mechanics. The transformation of the soul is clearly tied to the narrator’s actions, though minor tension or risk could amplify stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative employs elegant metaphor and symbolism (music, glass, choreography), evoking emotion and philosophical undertones. Subtext around memory, identity, and the afterlife is handled with deft poetic control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original concept with authentic stylistic flair. Metaphors are fresh, details specific, and the central image of reading reversed labels is both innovative and thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A tightly-woven piece that uses all elements meaningfully. The brevity feels purposeful, and the final note lingers with emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>
