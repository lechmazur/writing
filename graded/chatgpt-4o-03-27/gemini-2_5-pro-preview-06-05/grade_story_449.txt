<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s awkwardness, isolation, and philosophical drive are cohesively portrayed through her actions and tools; her transformation from reluctant winner to cosmic thinker feels earned and tonally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story traces a subtle but complete arc—with setup, philosophical exploration, and emotional resolution—within tight constraints; the fusion of tickets serves as an effective climax rooted in the established method and motivation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of evocative sensory details (petrichor, lightning hum, cosmic dough) creates a richly immersive atmosphere; the time dilation deck and nebula baking complement the reflective, slow-burn tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh imagery (e.g., “gravity as loneliness”) and unconventional tools (concert tickets + storm) avoid formula; minor abstraction in emotional beats may limit visceral connection, but overall voice and invention are strong.</comment>
