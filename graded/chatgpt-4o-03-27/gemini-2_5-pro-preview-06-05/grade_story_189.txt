<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The piece feels remarkably original in combining archaic technology, hauntings, and post-apocalyptic science; language is mostly precise, with few lapses into familiar tropes or overwriting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Intellectually and emotionally satisfying, with thoughtful integration of elements; slightly more vivid character grounding would make it fully unforgettable.</comment>
