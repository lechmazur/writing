<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivations are consistently rendered with nuance, and his internal conflict is deeply embedded in his actions and reactions; however, his "meekness" is suggested more by atmosphere than behavior, which slightly mutes the defined trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story exhibits a graceful arc with a subtle but satisfying progression; Elianâ€™s strange method coheres logically by the end, though understanding that logic requires a second read due to its abstract nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater, end-of-time setting is evocative and poetically rendered, reinforcing theme and tone beautifully; sensory detail is restrained but potent where it occurs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative is emotionally resonant with powerful metaphoric imagery and a refined use of language, though slightly opaque in places, which may reduce accessibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While emotionally sophisticated and highly original, some phrasing veers close to overwrought, and the method borders on conceptual abstraction; nonetheless, the originality and tone are deeply impressive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A deeply moving, cohesive piece with stylistic elegance and thematic depth; a few moments of conceptual vagueness slightly diminish immediate clarity but invite re-reading.</comment>
