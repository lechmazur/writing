<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo is vividly drawn through subtle actions, contradictions, and motivation; his emotional arc is compelling and his traits feel authentic, though Elara remains more symbolic than developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story demonstrates strong structural finesse, with a controlled arc, logical causality, and a satisfying resolution; the pacing is elegant, though the ghost tour detail feels slightly under-integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and delicately balanced between the mundane and the ethereal, with strong sensory and spatial use of the elevator and preservation lab to mirror emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative language, poignant imagery, and thematic depth yield strong emotional resonance; the metaphor of repair as release is original, though a slightly more complex Elara could strengthen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and a distinctive tone avoid clich√©, and emotional nuance is handled with restraint; still, the ghost-tour method feels more shorthand than subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A beautifully cohesive piece with clear emotional throughline, original thematic execution, and stylistic control that elevate it to near-ready for top-tier publication.</comment>
