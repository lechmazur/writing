<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is compelling, consistent, and emotionally resonant; her actions are closely tied to her sense of duty and defiance, though she could be slightly more individuated from the collective of scholars beyond her hidden object.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot has a strong arc with clear cause-and-effect; the build to the climax is well-paced, and the resolution—while subtle—is meaningful. However, transitions between some ideas feel compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sterile capsule hotel contrasts effectively with the emotional contamination; immersive atmospheric details like neural frequency ports and humming silence anchor the speculative setting masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Emotionally rich and layered with subtext; the poetic metaphor of an "earthbound flight" and corrupting truth via whispered memory is both powerful and elegantly executed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A cohesive, poignant narrative that uses each element to reinforce theme and atmosphere; lingers emotionally and intellectually despite the brevity.</comment>
