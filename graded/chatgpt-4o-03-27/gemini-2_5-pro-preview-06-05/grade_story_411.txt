<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734 exhibits a richly rendered purpose and emotional capacity consistent with its mechanical-yet-empathic nature; its motivation is clear and its reactions are layered, though lacking dynamic evolution across the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story maintains internal coherence and a complete emotional arc within the word constraint, with action tied directly to purpose—but its structure leans more meditative than plot-driven, lowering narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The world is powerfully immersive and vividly imagined, with rich sensory detail and symbolic resonance; the orchard, fountain, and starlight river create a cohesive emotional and thematic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Beautiful stylistic flourishes and poignant emotional resonance elevate the story; metaphors are potent and thematic cohesion is strong, though some repetition slightly dulls the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery and concept are highly original, though some phrases verge on overly ornate; the narrative avoids clichés and showcases emotional nuance, yet edges toward romanticized predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Despite its brevity, the story delivers a satisfying and profound whole, with strong thematic unity, emotional tone, and prose polish; a few moments of indulgence in language slightly dull clarity.</comment>
