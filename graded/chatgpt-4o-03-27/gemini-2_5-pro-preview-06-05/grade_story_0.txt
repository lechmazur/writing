<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Finch is clearly and consistently drawn; his sheepish demeanor and analytical creativity directly shape his actions and empathy, though more dialogue or internal conflict could deepen his humanity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot maintains tight coherence given the short length, with a beginning, shift, and resolution—but the pacing is slightly rushed near the climax, where transformation occurs rapidly with little resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Remarkably fresh concept and execution; avoids clichés while delivering striking imagery and original metaphor—only minor hints of over-formality in language detract slightly from the authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels deliberately crafted rather than constrained; imaginative use of elements creates a cohesive, meaningful whole that lingers emotionally and thematically.</comment>
