<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetype defined by labels ("devotion," "reverence") rather than specific, high-stakes choices or distinct interiority. There is no internal conflict or contradictory impulse; the character remains static and idealized throughout, lacking the specific, embodied emotion required for a 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The narrative fails to establish a specific scene, relying entirely on habitual summary ("would polish," "would wander") that prevents causal progression. Closure is non-existent; the sunset ending offers no decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance, merely the cessation of a routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Setting details remain generic ("towered hedges," "blooming flowers") and fail to ground the unique premise of "measurable luck" in concrete physical reality. The environment provides atmosphere but does not constrain action or force trade-offs, serving only as a backdrop for abstract reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>There is no active conflict or pressure; the dresser faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely performing a repetitive ritual without obstacle. The stakes are abstract ("prove that gardens know") and are never tested by a concrete threat or risk of failure on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The text aggressively explains its own themes ("symbolized the mended deception," "narrative of love") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext or action. The result is a moralizing summary that leaves no room for reader interpretation or resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and overly filtered through habitual aspect ("would"), creating a fable-like detachment that kills immediacy. This distance prevents any intimacy with the character's immediate experience or specific perception, flattening the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on abstract nouns ("allure," "practicality," "essence") and clichés ("toil under the sun," "cycle of life") instead of specific imagery. The reliance on "would" constructions creates a repetitive, lethargic rhythm that stalls momentum and dilutes the scene's density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While the concept of "measurable luck" is intriguing, it is relegated to backstory and not explored through specific consequences or mechanics. The remainder is a standard "wise gardener" trope lacking a fresh structural turn or specific emotional insight.</comment>
