<question>1</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined entirely by labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") rather than dramatized behavior or internal life. Emotions are explicitly stated ("filled her with a sense of hopeful desperation") instead of being embodied or shown through reaction. There are no on-page micro-choices or psychological depth, only high-level summary of intent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.0</grade><comment>The text is a synopsis rather than a narrative; it lacks a specific scene, a defined timeframe, or immediate causality. There is no orientation to a "now," and closure is a summarized outcome over time ("In the end...") rather than a dramatized event with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>1.3</grade><comment>Setting details are generic placeholders ("vibrant," "exotic foods," "diverse population") that fail to ground the reader in a specific physical reality. The environment never constrains the character's immediate actions or provides sensory texture beyond abstract adjectives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract and macro-scale ("gentrification," "privatization") without a specific on-page antagonist or obstacle to test the protagonist in real time. There is no escalation of immediate pressure, only a generalized description of resistance over days.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.1</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing and explicit statements ("story... of resilience," "testament to the strength of community"). The narrative explains the meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge organically from subtext or action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>The voice is purely expository and distant, reading like a pitch document or a Wikipedia summary rather than a literary narrative. There is no distinct perceptual signature, and the psychic distance remains extreme throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The prose is entirely abstract "telling" with significant repetitive sentence structures (multiple paragraphs beginning with "As..." or "The city..."). There is no sensory density, immediacy, or scenic momentum, only a dry recitation of events.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a raft city resisting gentrification has potential, the execution as a generalized summary strips it of any dramatic tension or originality. The story relies on clichés of resistance narratives without providing specific, lived details to make them fresh.</comment>
