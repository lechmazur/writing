<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on labels ("obsession," "burning need") rather than choices made under pressure. The sudden inclusion of a backstory about "lost loved ones" to explain motivation feels tacked on and unearned. Lena functions as a vehicle for the plot summary rather than a living agent in a scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a dramatized story, lacking a specific scene, anchor, or immediate inciting incident. The resolution—that files were merely archived—dissolves the conflict without cost or logical setup, rendering the prior tension moot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The setting consists of generic tropes ("dimly lit room," "labyrinth of servers," "digital abyss") without specific sensory grounding. The environment is treated as a passive backdrop for the summary rather than a constraint that influences the character's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract and summarized ("trail went cold," "unknown user") rather than experienced in real-time. The external threat ("They're watching") never manifests as a concrete obstacle, and the stakes remain theoretical throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Themes are delivered through explicit moralizing ("reminder of what could be found") and heavy-handed internal assertions. The story tells the reader what to feel about memory and loss rather than allowing those themes to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The voice is distant and explanatory, summarizing internal states and plot points instead of inhabiting the character's perspective. It suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," rushing to explain the significance of every clue immediately.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The prose is functional but laden with clichés ("swept under the rug," "shiver run down her spine," "new light") and passive constructions. The reliance on summary language ("The journey was taking her...") robs the narrative of immediacy and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The "corporate conspiracy uncovered by a lone investigator" premise is executed with standard tropes and no fresh subversion. The specific elements (numbers, patch) feel like prompt insertions rather than organic parts of a unique vision.</comment>
