<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks interiority, specific desires, or internal conflict, functioning as a generic plot device rather than a character. The narrative relies entirely on summary labels (e.g., "altruistic," "comforting") instead of dramatizing traits through behavior or micro-choices. There is no on-page scene work to establish voice or embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The piece reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a realized story, lacking a specific scene anchor (Who, Where, When) to ground the reader. The plot moves effortlessly from problem to solution without causality, resistance, or cost, failing to provide a valid closure unit. The "Orientation Test" failure (−0.5) applies due to the absence of a concrete timeframe or immediate setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting descriptions are generic ("breathtaking beauty," "lush trees") and fail to constrain action or influence character choices. The environment is treated as a static backdrop for summary exposition rather than a lived-in space with sensory specificity. Key elements like the "rock arches" appear decorative rather than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict or active resistance; the initiative succeeds through cooperation without obstacles, tradeoffs, or risks. The narrative lacks a dominant stake or meaningful escalation, as the "puzzled" settlers immediately solve the problem with no on-page struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("reminder of the power of collective effort") rather than emerging organically from narrative pressure. The resolution offers a simplistic, didactic message without complexity or ambiguity, resulting in a flat emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and purely expository, maintaining a "told" summary mode that creates immense psychic distance. There is no distinct perceptual signature or focalization; the text reports events from a high-level remove rather than inhabiting a perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>While grammatically functional, the prose is entirely expository, relying on passive constructions and summary verbs ("had watched," "was a comforting one"). The text violates the "Show, Don't Tell" principle throughout, lacking sensory density or sentence-level propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The premise and execution are derivative, resembling a generic fable or game backstory without a fresh narrative angle. The lack of specific, grounded detail results in a safe, predictable structure that takes no artistic risks.</comment>
