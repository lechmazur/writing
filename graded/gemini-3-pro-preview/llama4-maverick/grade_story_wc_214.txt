<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on abstract labels ("spiritually curious") rather than dramatized behavior or specific interiority. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or distinct traits, serving as a passive vessel for thematic summary without making any pressure-driven micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>The narrative is a static sequence of observations with no causal drive, rising action, or orientation beyond generic markers. Closure fails completely as there is no decisive change, reconfiguration, or paid cost; the ending merely restates the opening stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The setting is established through generic lists of "contraptions" and "computers" without sensory specificity that constrains the character's actions. The atmosphere is asserted through repetitive abstract nouns ("reverence," "stillness") rather than built through concrete detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>0.9</grade><comment>There is no on-page conflict, antagonist, or obstacle to generate narrative pressure. The story lacks stakes, as the protagonist faces no resistance and makes no trade-offs, resulting in a flatline of tension from start to finish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and repeated slogans ("strength in vulnerability") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative functions as a sermon on its own premise, lacking the complexity or ambiguity required for literary resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and monotonous, relying on a repetitive cadence of abstract assertions ("The janitor felt," "The janitor's task was"). There is no distinct perceptual signature or variation in psychic distance to match emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The prose is heavily repetitive, recycling specific phrases ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness," "strength in vulnerability") multiple times as a crutch. Text artifacts in the form of scaffold transitions ("As the night wore on," "As the night deepened") dominate the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The story relies on derivative "cosmic" tropes and abstract platitudes without offering a fresh angle or specific human reality. It takes no narrative risks, opting for safe, vague meditation that avoids the difficulty of dramatization.</comment>
