<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Maya is a vessel for thematic labels rather than a living character; her emotions are summarized ("unsettling sense," "warmly curious") rather than embodied. She faces no internal contradictions or difficult choices; her journey is a linear progression of unhindered success without psychological cost. Motivation is explicitly stated ("seeking to rebuild a connection") but never tested by pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative fails to form a scene, relying instead on a montage summary ("days turned into weeks") that dissolves narrative tension. There is no specific inciting incident within the frame, nor a causal chain of choices; events happen because the author wills them, not because the character acts under pressure. Closure is a generic "mission accomplished" state without a felt price or decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "catacomb orchard" where roots intertwine with bones is evocative, but the execution relies on visual clichés ("dappled shadows," "ancient bones") and abstract spaces ("passageways... seemed to stretch on forever"). The setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the earth yields easily ("brushing away dirt"), the tomb reveals secrets willingly, and Maya experiences no external opposition or internal doubt. Without obstacles, time pressure, or the risk of failure, the stakes remain purely theoretical. The excavation proceeds with a smoothness that eliminates dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through didactic assertion ("restoring a lost faith," "rebuild something within herself") rather than subtext or action. The story tells the reader exactly what it means at every turn, leaving no room for ambiguity or reader participation. It reads more like a prompt response summary than a narrative exploring complex human experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and heavily filtered, relying on "Maya felt," "Maya knew," and "Maya found herself" to mediate every experience. This filtering distances the reader from the immediate sensory reality of the scene. The tone is monotone and explanatory, lacking a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The prose is smooth but saturated with clichés ("shiver run down her spine," "drawn by an unseen thread," "window into a world"). Information density is low, with many sentences restating the protagonist's feelings rather than advancing the action. The verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") disrupts the flow and feels mechanical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the central image of the orchard-tomb has potential, the story relies on standard "diaspora return" tropes without adding a fresh or gritty specific twist. The "archaeology as self-discovery" metaphor is handled in a sanitized, predictable manner that avoids the messiness of actual history or memory.</comment>
