<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is a generic archetype defined by abstract labels ("turmoil," "fear") rather than specific, embodied interiority. She lacks agency, passively waiting for a deus ex machina (the woman in white) to solve her internal conflict without making any costly choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Causality is non-existent; the central conflict is resolved by a magical apparition rather than protagonist action, constituting a "soft reset" with no cost. The "feral nexus" is never grounded, leading to significant orientation debt, and the ending fails to provide the required closure unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The setting suffers from severe "white room" syndrome, described only as a vague "feral nexus" obscured by "swirling mist" without concrete sensory details. The environment does not constrain the character or shape the narrative, serving only as a backdrop for abstract musing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("struggling to make sense"), with no external pressure to force a decision. There is no escalation; the conflict is instantly diffused by the ghost's encouragement, resulting in a resolution devoid of earned difficulty or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing, explaining its own symbols ("manifestation of her own subconscious") instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action. The theme is delivered via heavy-handed telling, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The narrative distance is excessive, filtering nearly every experience through "she felt," "she saw," or "she realized." The voice is indistinguishable from generic melodramatic prose, lacking a unique perceptual signature or rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The prose is riddled with repetitive sentence structures (eight sentences begin with "As she...") and overuse of filter verbs. Abstract nouns replace concrete imagery ("sense of peace," "essence of the human experience"), and the text is clogged with "purple" clichés.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>The premise—a writer finding inspiration through a mystical encounter—is a worn cliché executed without a fresh angle or subversion. The narrative relies on familiar tropes and buzzwords ("follow her heart") rather than specific, original insight.</comment>
