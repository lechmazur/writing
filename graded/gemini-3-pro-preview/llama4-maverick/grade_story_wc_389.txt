<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The character is an abstract archetype functioning in summary, lacking specific interiority, contradictory impulses, or on-page micro-choices. Motivation is stated ("shape a new dawn") rather than dramatized through struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a synopsis spanning years rather than a dramatized scene, violating scope requirements. There is no scene-level causality; events progress through vague "and then" summation without an on-page climax, resistance, or a valid closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Setting details are limited to repetitive labels ("stormlit observatory," "cobalt glass portico") that act as static backdrops rather than constraints. There is no sensory engagement beyond visual abstractions; the environment never pressures a choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Conflict is purely abstract ("old ways" vs "new dawn") with no antagonist or resistance encountered on the page. The protagonist faces no obstacles, pays no cost, and succeeds effortlessly, resulting in zero narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Themes are explicitly stated ("power of vision," "variant allegiance") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending offers a tidy, moralizing summary of success that feels unearned and simplistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The voice is a distant, detached summary that creates a "fable" distance, preventing emotional connection. The narrative relies heavily on filtering verbs ("began to sense," "began to unfold") and repetitive syntactic structures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Severe "template cadence" artifacts appear, with nine sentences beginning with "As..." creating a monotonous rhythm. Frequent repetition of full noun phrases ("cobalt glass portico") and abstract diction results in low information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story relies on generic "visionary vs. status quo" tropes without a fresh angle or specific detail. The execution as a summary rather than a story strips it of potential ingenuity or emotional resonance.</comment>
