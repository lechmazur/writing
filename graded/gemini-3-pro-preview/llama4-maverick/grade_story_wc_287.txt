<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by labels ("wistfully pragmatic," "guardian") rather than choices or actions. Emotions are summarized ("felt a sense of peace") instead of embodied, and there is no internal contradiction or cost to their actions. The character acts as a passive observer of their own symbolic role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative lacks a drive lens; it is a linear sequence of events ("As X happened, Y happened") without causal tension or accumulation of pressure. The ending is a "soft reset" where the sun rises and the cycle continues, lacking any Decisive Change or felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The setting is established but relies on generic descriptors ("steel and stone," "hidden corners") and clichés ("soft blanket of tranquility"). The environment acts as a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>There is no visible conflict or obstacle; the gardener faces no resistance from the environment, the plant, or themselves. Stakes are abstract ("reflect light into dark corners") and are never tested on the page, resulting in zero narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated to the reader ("a symbol of the city's own resilience," "guardian of the city's beauty") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-explanation flattens resonance and treats the narrative as a vehicle for a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and overly filtered ("eyes were drawn," "seemed to be"), keeping the reader at arm's length. The tone is monotonously reverent, lacking the modulation or distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Severe template cadence artifacts are present; six paragraphs begin with "As [noun/pronoun] [verb]..." ("As they pruned," "As they worked," "As the night wore on," etc.). This creates a droning rhythm that kills propulsion. The prose relies heavily on abstraction and cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the juxtaposition of a gardener and a lockmaster has potential, the execution relies on safe, familiar "city magic" tropes without subversion. The story takes no risks, opting for a comforting, symmetrical vignette rather than a specific, hard-won insight.</comment>
