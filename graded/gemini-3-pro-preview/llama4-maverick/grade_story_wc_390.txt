<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on diagnostic labels ("logically emotional mind") rather than dramatized behavior. There is no internal conflict; the protagonist moves through the scene with perfect competence and generic emotional responses ("deep sense of purpose," "peace"). Motivation is stated as a job duty rather than a felt personal drive with stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural with no complications, reversals, or meaningful cost. The protagonist enters, performs the task successfully without resistance, and leaves; this lacks the required closure unit (Decisive Change/RR/CR) as the "before" and "after" states are identical regarding risk or knowledge. The ending is a soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The setting is described through generic clichés ("wisps of sunlight," "golden glow," "velvety blanket") rather than specific, grounded details. The environment serves as a static backdrop that does not constrain the character’s choices or tactics. "Fleshly ethereal" is told, not shown through atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the task is completed immediately upon attempt. The "fragile balance" is mentioned but never threatened, and the character faces no difficult trade-offs or opposing forces. Escalation is absent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Theme is delivered through heavy-handed abstract statements ("concept of sonic absolution," "balance between solidity and fluidity") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending moralizes a "sense of peace" without earning it through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is monotonous and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. There is no variation in distance; the text stays in a detached, reporting mode throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Severe reliance on template cadence; nearly half the paragraphs begin with "As [X]..." or "With [X]..." constructions. The prose suffers from high repetition of words ("creak," "ethereal," "vibration," "balance") and relies on purple, empty modifiers ("rich tapestry," "symphony of sound").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story executes the prompt elements in a rote, checklist fashion without synthesizing them into a fresh narrative. The "magical maintenance" trope is played straight with no specific twist or deepening of the core concept.</comment>
