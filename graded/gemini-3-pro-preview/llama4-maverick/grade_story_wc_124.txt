<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on prompt-labeling ("wistful lantern broker," "aromatically cautious") that never translates into behavior or choice. Emotions are distanced through diagnostic summary ("sense of awe," "sense of peace") rather than embodied experience. The protagonist is passive, observing a light show rather than driving narrative action through specific traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The plot lacks agency; the climax is a passive event (lights turning on) followed by a soft reset where the protagonist simply feels better. There is no decisive change or on-page cost; the narrative relies on "and then" sequencing rather than causal progression. The closure is unearned, resolving deep grief through a momentary mood shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>While the "greenhouse for extinct plants" is a distinct concept, the execution relies on vague placeholders ("rare flora," "hidden patterns," "blooming flowers") rather than specific sensory detail. The setting acts as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("pain of loss") with no external pressure or time constraint to force a decision. The story lacks a moment of risk; the resolution comes from a passive environmental change rather than a protagonist's struggle or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Theme is handled through explicit moralizing statements ("grasped the impact of memories") rather than subtext or dramatic inquiry. The narrative summarizes the lesson learned in the final paragraphs, flattening complexity into a tidy, unearned platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and cluttered with filter verbs ("Elara felt," "she realized," "she knew"), preventing immersion. The phrase "aromatically cautious nature" is a jarring label that reads as an artificial prompt insertion rather than an organic voice component.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Severe syntactic monotony and artifact looping destroy the prose quality; nearly half the paragraphs begin with "As [clause]." The phrase "sense of [emotion]" appears six times, and "wash over her" appears four times, indicating a total lack of lexical control and line-level variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The combination of a lantern broker and extinct plants offers a spark of novelty, but the execution falls into a generic, risk-averse emotional template. The story avoids specific, non-obvious synthesis, relying instead on clichés ("bittersweet reminder," "shiver run down her spine").</comment>
