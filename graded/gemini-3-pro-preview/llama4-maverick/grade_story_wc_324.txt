<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetype defined by labels ("contact tracer," "curious") rather than specific, contradictory desires. Emotional calibration is artificial; she feels an "instant connection" and resolves deep grief with a simple touch, lacking the human friction or internal cost required for credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "Soft Reset" anti-pattern where complex grief vanishes instantly upon receiving a platitude, rendering the resolution unearned. The story stops frequently for expository lumps ("Aria's role was...", "Her method was...") that explain the plot rather than dramatizing the inciting pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Descriptors like "mist-clad atrium" and "otherworldly silence" are generic and atmospheric rather than grounding or constraining. The hearing aid is a promising specific prop, but its operation is described in vague, magical terms ("gentle hum") rather than tactile interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Pressure is virtually non-existent; the protagonist encounters no genuine opposition from the environment, the signal, or the grieving woman. The resolution arrives without a "meaningful tightening" or forced trade-off; success is automatic, making the stakes theoretical rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing summary ("Aria had found a way to protect vulnerable voices") rather than emerging from subtextual action. The ending relies on a stated lesson ("reminder of the work she did") instead of a resonant, unresolved image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The voice is distant and heavily filtered ("Aria realized," "she knew," "she felt"), which prevents immersion in the moment. The tone is consistently melodramatic ("tears streaming," "balm to her sorrow") without modulation, flattening the narrative into a single emotional note.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense with clichés ("tears streaming," "balm to her sorrow," "shroud," "veil") and abstract adjectives that dull the imagery. Sentence rhythm is repetitive and explanatory, often using "As [clause], [main clause]" structures that stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>While the concept of "contact tracing for hearts" offers a fresh prompt interpretation, the execution leans on standard "ghost whisperer" tropes without subversion. The narrative path is safe and predictable, lacking the specific risk or synthesis of ideas required for higher bands.</comment>
