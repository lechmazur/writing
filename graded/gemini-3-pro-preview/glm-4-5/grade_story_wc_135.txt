<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on stated traits ("reactively visionary") and duty rather than dramatized choices under pressure. Elina faces no internal conflict, pays no cost for her insights, and succeeds without genuine struggle, functioning as a vehicle for the premise rather than a living agent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a broad summary of events spanning days rather than a dramatized scene with causal links. There is no specific on-page closure unit (Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration); the ending merely summarizes ongoing success, and plot points arrive via convenience (visions, the diary) rather than protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>While sensory adjectives are present ("glistening stones," "briny scent"), the setting remains a generic backdrop that never constrains the protagonist's options. The environment is described ornamentally rather than interacting with the character's goals or physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("burden of years") but never tested; there is no active resistance or possibility of failure. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, and the resolution comes from a convenient external object (the diary) rather than earned escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated through moralizing exposition ("not with false promises but with the truth") rather than emerging from action. The didactic tone flattens complexity, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the healing process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and overly "helpful," summarizing emotional shifts ("anger softening to sorrow") instead of dramatizing them. The POV lacks a distinct texture, relying on high-flown abstract language that keeps the reader at arm's length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Prose is weighed down by abstract nouns and adjective stacking ("pristine but painful emptiness"). Prompt phrases ("reactively visionary," "staggered intervals") are inserted as clumsy expository labels that disrupt natural syntax and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>While the concept of an archivist healing via objects has potential, the execution relies on standard "restore the kingdom" tropes without specific, fresh details. The resolution feels inevitable and unearned, lacking a unique twist on the premise.</comment>
