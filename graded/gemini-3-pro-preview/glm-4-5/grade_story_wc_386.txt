<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is functionally defined by labels ("motivation was simple") rather than dramatized through internal struggle or specific, embodied emotion. She lacks agency in a specific moment, serving instead as a passive vehicle for a summarized procedural plot without personal cost or contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a synopsis rather than a story, relying on broad summary ("Night after night," "One by one") instead of grounding the reader in a single, pressurized scene. This summary mode creates a complete lack of immediate causality or orientation, violating the scope requirements for short fiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Settings like the "glacier shrine" and "frigid waters" are presented as generic backdrops without sensory specificity or constraints that shape character choice. The environment feels like a white room decorated with adjectives rather than a lived-in space that exerts pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>There is no active resistance or conflict on the page; Elara seeks, finds, analyzes, and exposes the truth without facing a single obstacle or paying a visible price. The resolution is automatic and unearned, with the antagonists and descendants accepting the outcome passively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit, sermonizing statements ("sometimes the most powerful truths are those we discover ourselves") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending reduces complex grief and betrayal to a tidy, moralizing lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, telling the reader what to feel rather than evoking it through distinct perception. The excessive repetition of prompt phrases ("borrowed starlight") creates a mechanical, rote cadence that flattens the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The text suffers from severe artifacting, repeating the exact phrases "borrowed starlight," "windows of connection," and "salvage something pure" three times each within a very short word count. These repetitions act as clumsy scaffolding that disrupts rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the prompt integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story relies on standard ghost-whisperer tropes—finding an object to solve a cold case via dreams—without offering a fresh perspective or specific, lived detail. The execution is formulaic, prioritizing plot mechanics over emotional or conceptual risk.</comment>
