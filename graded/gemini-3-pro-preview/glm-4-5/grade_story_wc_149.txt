<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's core motivation is logically incoherent: the text claims she owes a debt to Thomas for saving her from fire, yet the backstory scene shows her saving him and dying in the process. This contradiction muddles her agency. Her internal state is described with generic labels ("mournful," "elation") rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative momentum stalls significantly in the middle third (paragraphs 7-12) for a heavy backstory dump that explains rather than dramatizes. The closure relies on an epilogue with a new POV (the groundskeeper) to explain the significance of the bloom, rather than letting the ghost's final action stand on its own strength.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like the "bioluminescent life" and "frost perpetually danced." The greenhouse feels tangible and atmospheric, effectively grounding the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Escalation is primarily external and passive; the protagonist waits seven years for a celestial alignment she doesn't control. Her agency is compressed into a single, low-resistance action (releasing seeds) at the very end, lacking a sense of rising pressure or difficult trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in the final paragraph ("The greenhouse stood as testimony...") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. This "telling" flattens the potential resonance of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The POV control is loose, drifting from the ghost's perspective to Thomas's backstory and finally to the groundskeeper's future thoughts. This head-hopping dilutes emotional intimacy, and the "cameo appearances" phrase creates a jarring register clash with the gothic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from repetitive artifact insertion ("lovingly venomous" appears twice) and logical oxymorons ("clutched... in nonexistent hands"). The backstory logic regarding who saved whom is syntactically confused, breaking the causal chain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story relies on standard ghost-romance tropes (the tragic debt, the eternal vigil, the final bloom) without subverting them or offering a fresh perspective. The execution is competent but predictable.</comment>
