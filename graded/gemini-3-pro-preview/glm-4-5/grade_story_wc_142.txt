<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Characterization relies on labeling rather than dramatization; the "dual allegiance" is stated in summary ("struggled with their dual allegiance") rather than shown through conflicting choices in the moment. Maya functions more as a plot device than a living person, with traits like her "orderly intuitive mind" told directly to the reader.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story operates as a synopsis or montage ("For three nights," "As the carnival continued") rather than a dramatized scene. The climax is anticlimactic and distanced, occurring via a notice posted on a bulletin board rather than an on-page confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sensory details effectively ground the setting, such as "fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater" and "neon constellations." The floating raft city is visualized well, though the description sometimes lists attributes rather than weaving them into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The central conflict is resolved too easily through summary; the flash mobs convince the investors off-page, leading to "surprisingly favorable" terms without visible struggle. The antagonists are reduced to caricatures ("ties and polished shoes comically out of place"), lowering the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The water remembers what land forgets") and a didactic conclusion. The story explains its meaning ("reorganizing a community was never about one person's guidance") rather than allowing subtext to emerge organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and filter-heavy ("Maya paused," "Maya watched"), creating a barrier to immediacy. The perspective summarizes emotional states instead of inhabiting them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Contains conspicuous errors, including a typo ("blossomig") and a grammatical stumble ("culture need not absorb shocks anymore"). The prose relies heavily on abstract telling ("intoxicating atmosphere," "chaotic") rather than concrete showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the "graffiti code on a raft city" premise shows promise, the execution follows a generic "save the community center" template. The resolution is convenient and lacks a fresh twist on the trope.</comment>
