<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by a compelling high-concept profession ("obituaries for the living") but lacks embodied struggle. His internal journey feels declared rather than dramatized; the "projection of presence" functions as a convenient ability without cost or failure, reducing the weight of his final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the pivot to self-reflection at the end provides legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression is linear and low-friction; the inciting incident and climax occur smoothly without significant obstacles or causal density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The setting relies heavily on the repeated phrase "shadowed garden" (appearing five times), which flattens the atmosphere into a label rather than a sensory reality. While the autumn imagery is consistent, the lack of specific, non-repetitive detail limits immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conflict is entirely internal and resolved through quiet reflection, lacking external pressure or difficult trade-offs. The protagonist's ability to "project presence" removes the potential for failure in his work, leaving the stakes purely abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of healing and memory is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on explicit thesis statements ("mapping the geography of healing"). The resonance is limited by this didactic approach, leaving little room for subtextual complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like lyricism that suits the subject matter. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "spirits preparing for winter," distancing the reader from the immediate reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose flow is severely hampered by the mechanical repetition of prompt keywords ("shadowed garden" x5, "lonesome splendor" x2, "geography of..." x3). These artifacts create a stilted, checklist-like rhythm that obscures the otherwise competent sentence structure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The central concept of writing obituaries for the living is genuinely inventive and offers a fresh hook. However, the execution follows a standard "healing in a garden" template, relying on familiar tropes of war and memory without subverting them.</comment>
