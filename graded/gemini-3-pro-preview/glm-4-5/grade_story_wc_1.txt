<question>1</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on summary and label-like traits ("steadily adaptive") rather than dramatized behavior. The protagonist's internal conflict is explicitly stated ("no longer creating art for art's sake") but does not manifest in difficult on-page choices or contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The plot advances through unearned realization and "dream logic" (chemical plates + frost = decoding a ledger) rather than causal action. The resolution violates the cost proof test, as the protagonist arrives at the answer instantly without paying a price or facing an active obstacle in the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The setting is described with generic, cliché phrases ("vast tapestry," "profound silence") that fail to create a specific, sensory environment. While the glass plates are a specific detail, the canyon itself functions as a static backdrop rather than an interactive space that pressures the character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>There is no immediate, on-page conflict or escalation; the threat is entirely in the past or future. The scene lacks a tightening of stakes or a moment where the protagonist must make a trade-off, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via heavy-handed moralizing in the final paragraph ("art could change the world"), replacing subtext with a direct sermon. The story resolves into a tidy lesson rather than exploring the complexity of the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable but excessively distant, relying on filter verbs ("she decided," "she noticed," "seemed to speak") that keep the reader at arm's length. The prose explains the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting her perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prose is functional but weighed down by adjective-heavy exposition and repetitive sentence structures ("She had been," "She had placed"). A grammatical error ("force of physical blow" missing an article) and the reliance on summary sap momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story reads like a synopsis rather than a fully realized narrative. While the core concept of using glass art to decode a ledger is novel, the execution relies on convenient tropes and magical leaps of logic that undermine plausibility.</comment>
