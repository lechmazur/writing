<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses; he moves linearly toward his goal without hesitation. The emotional resolution feels unearned because there is no behavioral struggle or trade-off; he simply enacts a procedure and receives catharsis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "magic button" resolution where the protagonist achieves his desire without complication or cost, violating the closure requirement for felt price. The causality is weak—the discovery of the letters "yesterday" is a convenient backstory patch that removes narrative pressure from the present scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the "laboratory of lost sounds" is evocative, blending techno-mysticism with sensory detail. However, the fusion of "constellation tattooist" and "firmware engineer" feels disjointed, as the setting doesn't organically support the dual occupation beyond aesthetic cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>There is virtually no escalation or opposition within the scene; the protagonist faces no risk of failure, external resistance, or difficult choice. The dominant stake (relieving guilt) is resolved through a successful, first-try technical operation rather than narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme of grief and memory is present but delivered through explicit telling ("bridge between his grief and relief") rather than subtext. The ending moralizes the experience, reducing potential resonance to a summary statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and maintains a somber, lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the POV creates distance by filtering emotions through melodramatic descriptors ("raking at the dissonance") rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose relies on stock phrasing ("tears streamed," "folding like origami") and adjective-heavy constructions ("haunted firmware," "ancient servers") that dull the imagery. The flow is functional but lacks the freshness and density required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the combination of elements (tattooist, amber, haunted firmware) is inventive on a surface level, the underlying narrative arc is a standard sentimental resolve. The story executes a "prompt salad" without synthesizing the disparate parts into a novel emotional logic.</comment>
