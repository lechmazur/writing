<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on abstract labels ("curious," "functionally creative," "stoic") rather than demonstrated behavior or specific interiority. The protagonist lacks internal conflict or distinct flaws, and her motivation ("puzzling out new equations for hope") is vague and undramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Causality is broken by "magic engineering"; rewiring dormant transformers in a disconnected facility cannot generate power without a source, shattering plausibility for an engineer protagonist. The ending relies on unearned convenience, where the sextant inexplicably reveals equations under the lights, functioning as a deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting is established but relies on generic descriptors ("dusty console," "gleaming," "sleeping giants") that lack sensory specificity or unique texture. The spaceport feels like a skin over a generic abandoned building rather than a place with specific, constrained geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no external opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The "challenge" of the terminal is resolved through a montage of "careful precision" without a single setback or cost, rendering the stakes theoretical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("equations for hope," "tool for navigation... through hope itself") rather than subtext. The narrative tells the reader what to feel instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and over-explanatory, frequently summarizing significance ("maze of intentions," "legacy") instead of showing it. The psychic distance is unstable, drifting into abstract generalizations that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Prose is weighed down by clichés ("echoing with emptiness," "stars awakening") and repetitive phrasing ("stoic determination," "stoic wonder"). The phrase "functionally creative" is inserted awkwardly as a label, and "maze of intentions" is repeated verbatim, indicating a limited lexical pool.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The premise is a standard "repair the world" trope with little innovation; the combination of elements feels like a checklist rather than an organic story. The resolution depends on a fantastical leap (hidden equations on a brass tool) that clashes with the established tech level.</comment>
