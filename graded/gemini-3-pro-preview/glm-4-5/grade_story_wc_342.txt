<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the protagonist lacks internal friction; the "burden" of her condition is resolved instantly by the artifact without embodied struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Causality breaks when the protagonist intuitively identifies the coin as an "algorithmic key" without evidence; closure lacks a visible cost as success is total and unhindered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hollowed tree library is established with vivid, tactile details ("spiraling grain," "carved leaf patterns") that ground the scene, though technical descriptors like "fractally precise" clash with the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is static; the external threat of demolition never forces a difficult trade-off, and the coin functions as a deus ex machina that eliminates the artistic struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through exposition ("patterns of their souls") rather than subtext; the resolution relies on a moralizing summary that explains the meaning instead of dramatizing it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, relying on abstract summaries of cognition ("understanding dawning," "curiosity piqued") rather than immediate sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by filter verbs ("seemed," "envisioning") and clichéd phrases ("curiosity piqued," "just so") that distance the reader from the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the setting is imaginative, the narrative arc follows a standard "found object solves the problem" template without a fresh twist on the prompt elements.</comment>
