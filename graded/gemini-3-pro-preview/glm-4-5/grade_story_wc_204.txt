<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Eldon functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character; his obsession is stated in exposition ("desperate longing") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. His reaction to the climax is passive ("watched in awe"), and the final realization relies on summary ("Eldon understood then") rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and resolution, though the "seven days" transition relies on summary that dilutes tension. The closure effectively reframes the premise (preservation to flow) with a legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard is a vivid, imaginative setting that actively shapes the narrative, from the "dendritic frost" input method to the warping walls that signal escalation. The environment integrates tightly with the plot, providing both the container and the debris for the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent but remain abstract ("reality," "eternity") rather than viscerally felt. While the physical pressure on the library escalates (warping, churning clouds), the personal cost to Eldon is intellectualized and accepted too easily to generate high tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus evolution is well-articulated and lands a resonant final image ("patterns reforming"). The ending successfully reconfigures the central question, moving from static containment to dynamic living truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the mythic setting ("negotiable firmament"), but suffers from psychic distance. The reliance on filter verbs prevents intimacy, keeping the reader observing Eldon rather than inhabiting his perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>While the imagery is lush, the prose relies heavily on filter verbs at pivotal moments ("Eldon knew," "watched in awe," "understood," "realized"), which robs the climax of immediacy. Telling ("It wasn't mere curiosity... but a desperate longing") replaces showing in key character beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a glass library for "worlds that never were" is evocative, and the specific mechanic of the letterpress interacting with reality offers a fresh take on the magical library trope. The visual invention elevates the familiar theme.</comment>
