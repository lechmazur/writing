<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes defined by labels ("altruistic," "strangely trustworthy") rather than complex individuals with contradictory impulses. There is no interiority or scene-based interaction to reveal depth; motivation is stated in summary rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The piece functions as a synopsis or historical summary spanning generations rather than a dramatized story with a distinct scene. It fails the orientation test by lacking a specific anchored moment, and the resolution is a broad timeline of success without a closure unit carrying felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setting details ("floating rock arches," "violet sunsets") remain distant, postcard-like visuals that do not constrain character tactics or shape the narrative path. The environment is a passive backdrop rather than an active force pressuring choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Conflict is resolved through simple compliance with instructions, lacking resistance, reversals, or genuine struggle. The stakes are declared ("survival") but never tested or felt in a moment of crisis; the solution feels inevitable and cost-free.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit, repeated moralizing about "strangers becoming family" rather than emerging organically from action. The narrative relies on telling the reader what to feel rather than earning resonance through subtext or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like omniscient summary that creates a barrier to immersion. It lacks the specific perceptual signature or psychic distance control required for modern literary fiction, keeping the reader at arm's length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Prose relies heavily on telling and abstract summary ("relationships deepened," "troubles were brewing") rather than concrete sensory detail. Phrasing is occasionally clumsy ("strangers fully become family"), and "Arche studying" appears to be a typo or an undefined proper noun.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The premise of a benevolent ghost guiding colonists to a magical agricultural solution is a standard trope executed without a fresh angle. The narrative lacks specific, non-obvious details or subversions that would distinguish it from a generic fable.</comment>
