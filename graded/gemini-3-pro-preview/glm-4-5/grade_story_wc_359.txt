<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Eira is a functional vehicle for the ritual rather than a protagonist under pressure; her "untouched by mortal concerns" competence removes all risk of failure. There is no internal conflict, decision-making dilemma, or visible cost paid to achieve the outcome, leaving her static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural of a successful ritual without meaningful complication, deviation, or causal turn. The closure is a pre-ordained success state ("wonder made manifest") achieved without cost or trade-off, lacking narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The glacial cathedral and synesthetic effects are described with vivid sensory detail, though the imagery relies heavily on generic "ethereal" descriptors. The setting facilitates the ritual but doesn't provide gritty, specific constraints that force adaptation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the ritual proceeds without error, environmental resistance, or antagonism. The stakes are stated abstractly ("world growing deaf") but never tested through on-page struggle or the possibility of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertion in the final paragraphs ("proving irrefutably that such wonder...") rather than emerging from the action. This didactic "sermonizing" flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The POV is ostensibly limited to Eira but drifts into omniscience to describe the crowd's internal reactions ("Observers... felt their breath steady") without a section break. This head-hopping dilutes the intimacy of the synesthetic experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten and dense with abstract metaphors ("unfetter potential energies," "woven from starlight") that create a static, ornamental texture. Heavy use of filter verbs ("visible to her," "felt") distances the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The concept of a magical musical ritual is a familiar fantasy trope executed here without subversion or unique complication. The "sculpted hush" is a nice image, but the surrounding structure is standard and risk-averse.</comment>
