<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character motivation relies on abstract labels ("preserve the echo of lost songs") rather than embodied desire. The protagonist's internal change is summarized through a magical object ("learning to trust again") rather than dramatized through difficult choices or psychological friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative structure fails the scene test, relying on broad summary ("span of days that grew into weeks") rather than a continuous dramatized event. Causality is weak; the protagonist follows the dictates of a magical object without skepticism or agency, leading to a frictionless resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting consists of generic tropes ("dusty attic," "lonely beam," "aging paper") without specific constraints that pressure the character. Sensory details are present but lean toward cliché rather than lived-in texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>There is no meaningful opposition or external pressure; the arc is a linear accumulation of positive steps. The "cost" of releasing the meteorite is framed as aesthetically "appropriate" rather than a difficult trade-off, neutralizing tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Theme is explicitly stated in the final lines ("finding balance at last between her past and future"), which violates the show-don't-tell rule for resonance. The narrative explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like tone that prevents immediacy. The perspective filters the story through summary and explanation rather than direct experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from "purple" artifacts and heavy adjective-noun pairing ("cosmic dust of her yesterdays," "stubborn dust motes," "ancient vibrations"). Metaphors often clutter the sentence logic rather than clarifying the image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story connects the prompt elements in a linear, expected fashion without subverting tropes. The premise of "dust divination" feels like an arbitrary magical fix rather than an earned narrative development.</comment>
