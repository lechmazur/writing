<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal arc is clear, and the physical scar effectively mirrors the psychological wound. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("fought flames the way other men fought lovers," "innocence became currency") rather than raw, embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the visceral reality of his guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, with a clear scene leading to a tangible closure unit (the ash-to-ink ritual). The "reflecting deeply" bridge is a weak transition that summarizes rather than dramatizes the pivotal realization, but the final physical action and the decision to visit the survivors' group provide a strong, earned resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional, particularly the "shallow dish of granite" which acts as a necessary constraint for the ritual. Atmospheric details are specific ("pines still smelled of last summer’s burn"), though occasionally the celestial descriptions veer into overwrought pathetic fallacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes—silence vs. testimony—are legible and the cost (reliving the trauma) is felt on the page. The conflict is primarily internal and retrospective; the lack of immediate external pressure or an active obstacle in the present moment limits the tension, though the ritual provides a sufficient focal point for the struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of translating trauma is resonant, but the execution is heavy-handed, with the story explicitly explaining its own meaning ("pain translated into something water could carry"). The ending moralizes the outcome ("paid interest on the bargain"), reducing subtextual power in favor of direct instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent but intrusive, often interpreting the character's experience through a filter of high-literary stylization ("fire writes in verbs"). This stylistic layer occasionally blocks access to the character’s immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Technical control is present, but the prose suffers from significant metaphor density ("fragile as testimony," "blade of mercy," "dictionary entry for pain"). This figurative congestion obscures clarity and aestheticizes the suffering to the point of distraction, triggering overwriting penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central image of turning ash and tears into ink is a specific, imaginative synthesis that elevates the familiar "scarred healer" trope. While the setup is standard, the ritualistic execution of the closure offers a fresh, tactile resolution to the emotional arc.</comment>
