<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s final sacrifice is a compelling, high-stakes choice that earns the ending. However, her internal state relies too heavily on inserted labels (“quietly enthusiastic”) rather than embodied reaction, making her feel occasionally like a vessel for prompt terms rather than a living focalizer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc creates a distinct, complete movement from investigation to transfiguration. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the protagonist into a new form with a clear, on-page physical cost that satisfies the buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ambered deck is a vivid, active participant that mirrors the plot’s contraction and expansion. Sensory details—molten gold, cold alloy, frozen starlight—effectively ground the high-concept cosmic abstraction in tactile experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are existential and clearly defined, escalating logically from interpretation to physical dissolution. The cost of the final choice—surrendering human identity to become the signal—is viscerally felt and reweights the initial goal of survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of necessary dissonance and stewardship across cosmic cycles is profound and executed with restraint. The ending resonates without moralizing, allowing the “stellar doubt” to serve as a meaningful philosophical counterweight to the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice establishes a consistent, mythic sci-fi tone that suits the subject matter well. However, the integration of required phrases occasionally forces awkward syntax (e.g., noun phrases used as verbs) that briefly disrupts the narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the imagery is often striking, the prose struggles to integrate the prompt phrases naturally. Constructions like “could still wavelength align with purpose” read as grammatical errors, and the repetition of static phrases (“understanding static bursts”) creates mechanical drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse for the next universe built on the fossils of the old is fresh and evocative. The transformation of the protagonist into a waveform offers a creative, non-standard resolution to the "last survivor" trope.</comment>
