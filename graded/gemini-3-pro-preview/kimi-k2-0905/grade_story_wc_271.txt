<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is vividly embodied through the somatic markers, grounding the grief. However, the explicit self-labeling ("People say I am quietly talented") and the declarative emotional summary ("My motivation is...") read as artificial prompt insertions rather than organic characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, using the walk as a frame for the internal journey. The closure—sealing the photo in resin—is a strong, tangible Resonant Reconfiguration (RR). The "new covenant" speech slightly over-explains the resolution, softening the impact of the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally integrated; the plants are not just backdrop but active tools in the narrator's therapy (somatic anchors). Specific details like "sea lavender" and "dragon’s-blood pine" create high sensory texture. Capped at 8.8 per the Q2&lt;9.0 rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The internal stakes are managed well, with the "freeze" exercise providing a clear mechanism for escalation. The cost is felt in the sacrifice of the photograph, a meaningful trade-off for psychological survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Subtext suffers from explicit moralizing in the final third. Lines like "I think: grief is not a landmine..." and "optimism without memory is just noise" summarize the theme directly, converting resonance into a sermon. This violates the show-don't-tell preference for high-end fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and lyrical ("fractured into white creases"), suiting the somber mood. It falters only when accommodating clunky prompt phrases ("quietly talented," "my motivation is"), which momentarily disrupt the immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("roots grip stone like desperate fingers"). Minor slips into preciousness ("pain pauses, confused") or scientific oddities ("green oxygen") prevent a higher score, but the line-level craft is generally strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of somatic trauma therapy with an arboretum setting is a fresh, specific concept. The ritual of embedding the photo in resin offers a unique and memorable image of closure.</comment>
