<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia serves as a compelling mythic protagonist, her internal conflict (past failure vs. present hope) dramatized effectively through the ritual of the mirrors. Her specific "poet" identity informs her tactical choices, transforming abstract desire into concrete action. The sacrifice at the end feels earned by her backstory of "twenty years in a lunar quarry" and her confession of failure, though her dissolution leans slightly into symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a strong Accumulative logic, where the density of the mirror-covering ritual builds the necessary charge for the climax. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist is consumed, but the world is re-seeded. The pacing is excellent, though the archaeologist's immediate conversion by the light is a slightly rapid resolution to the external threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but structurally essential; the "visible time" and the "mirrors" actively constrain the protagonist's choices and dictate the middle-game tactics. The "baroque asteroid" feels lived-in and specific, with details like the "collapsed harpsichord" and "obsidian wall" anchoring the surreal premise in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is clear, with the approaching "storm of time" and the intrusive archaeologist providing external pressure that forces the climax. However, the resolution of the antagonist—staggering as light passes through him and essentially being rewritten—bypasses a more active confrontation or trade-off, relying on the magical potency of the shard rather than a final tactical maneuver.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of art reshaping reality is woven flawlessly into the plot mechanics; the "boulevards named after poets" is both a vision and a concrete outcome. The story achieves a high level of resonance, offering a non-literal answer to the question of revolutionary failure by suggesting a transformation of the future rather than a correction of the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like mode, maintaining a consistent high register. The shift in focalization at the end—from Aurelia to the archaeologist—is handled smoothly, serving as a "passing of the torch" that reinforces the theme of legacy. The tone manages to be elevated without becoming distant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative ("glassy throat," "dagger of light"), supporting the "baroque" setting. However, the repetition of the distinct word "burnished" (voice, sorrow, sorrow) three times draws attention to itself as an artifact. Occasionally, the figurative language stacks heavily (e.g., "ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood"), threatening to obscure the image with density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of "visible time," revolutionary politics, and the specific ritual of covering mirrors creates a genuinely fresh narrative landscape. The ending, which reimagines a civilization through poetry stored in silica, feels inevitable yet surprising. It transforms the trope of the "precursor artifact" into something intimate and active.</comment>
