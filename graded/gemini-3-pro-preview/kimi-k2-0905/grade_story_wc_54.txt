<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") and interiority relies on poetic labeling ("silence honest") rather than grounded emotion. Alya encounters no genuine resistance, making her competence feel unearned and her character flat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear progression of successful tasks without setbacks or causal turns that raise stakes. Closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where everything works perfectly with no visible or felt cost paid by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid but often obscured by overwrought descriptions ("Möbius confession," "rust landscaped") that prioritize sound over sense. The atmosphere is established, though the spatial geography of the repairs becomes vague under the weight of metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually nonexistent; mechanical obstacles yield instantly to the protagonist's touch. The "unsolvable equations" are resolved without struggle, and the lack of opposition or trade-offs eliminates dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Theme is didactic, articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Design for resurrection") and on-the-nose symbolism (the "Hope" equation). Subtext is absent, replaced by a lecture on the story's meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive and elevated ("stanza in a grammar of reclamation"), creating distance. The hologram's voice blends indistinguishably with the narrator's poetic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense with mixed metaphors and "purple" phrasing ("zero-mass comet," "choked filters... attitudes of prayer") that distracts from clarity. The "Hope =" equation serves as a clichéd textual artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise of "engineering as magical healing" is familiar and executed with sentimental tropes. The resolution relies on a convenient hologram and a simplistic equation, offering little freshness.</comment>
