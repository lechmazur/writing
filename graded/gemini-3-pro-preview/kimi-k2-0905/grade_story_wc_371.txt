<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mila acts as a functional vehicle for the concept rather than a fully realized character with distinct internal contradictions. While her motivation as a "noticer" drives the plot, her emotional arc feels somewhat emblematic, lacking deep friction or personal stakes beyond the thematic goal. The specific phrasing of her attribute ("heuristically gentle") feels forced and creates distance rather than intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear fable-like structure with a solid logical progression from discovery to cultivation to realization. However, the middle section relies heavily on summary ("Weeks lengthened"), which diffuses narrative tension. The closure lands a resonant conceptual reconfiguration, but the ease of the resolution—magic simply working—lowers the dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively blending the urban decay with magical realism ("flour ghosts," "vines parted"). The sensory details, like the "lantern flickering like a pulse" and the "soil under every fingernail," ground the surreal elements effectively. The tea house and the ruined palace serve as strong, distinct anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The conflict between memory and erasure is clear but lacks immediate, high-pressure escalation on the page. The antagonist (entropy/the city) is passive, and the protagonist's success feels inevitable once the method is acquired. The lack of a "tightening" moment where failure seems possible or a significant personal cost is paid keeps the stakes abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of cultivating memory is coherent and consistently developed, though the execution is somewhat didactic. Phrases like "bread is daily resurrection" and "guilt rises like yeast" state the subtext explicitly rather than letting it emerge solely from action. The final epiphany offers a solid conceptual repricing of the sacred as "continuous."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone appropriate for the genre. However, the repeated insertion of prompt-specific phrases ("creeping normality," "heuristically gentle") disrupts the natural rhythm and feels mechanical. The narrative distance is controlled, but the "filter verbs" (noticed, sensing) occasionally dilute immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense and often evocative but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("creeping normality" x4, "uncloak" x3) and clunky integration of required elements. The usage of "heuristically gentle" as a trailing modifier is grammatically awkward and breaks the flow twice. Some metaphors ("ovens had exhaled it") border on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of guerrilla gardening, baking, and memory loss is imaginative and fresh. The central image of herbs spelling out vanished names is a striking visual that elevates the "fading city" trope. The transformation of the loaf into seeds for a memory garden offers a creative twist on the preservation theme.</comment>
