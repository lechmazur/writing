<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation to archive grief in mortar is compelling, but her interiority relies on slightly melodramatic tropes (the "waltzes" note feels generic). The explicit labeling of her as "stoically sensitive" and the performative wince at the gull cry weaken the "show, don't tell" impact of her characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ritualistic descent functions well as a plot structure, utilizing the tide as a natural ticking clock. Closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical weight of the inkwell translates into a felt emotional release, though the linear progression lacks a sharp, unexpected turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The integration of surveyor tools (steel spatula, hydraulic lime) with the atmospheric ruin creates a tactile, grounded setting. The environment actively constrains the method, forcing Mara to interact physically with the wet stone and rising water, grounding the abstract concept of "interlaced absence."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly from placing paper notes to the riskier, more permanent act of writing directly on the stone. The internal stakes (release of memory) and external constraint (the drawbridge/tide) braid well, though the external danger feels more atmospheric than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of preserving abandoned dreams is evocative but frequently overstated in the text (e.g., "stitching a wound shut with thread made of light"). By explicitly articulating the subtext via the "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" line, the story reduces the interpretive resonance of the physical action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, suited to the setting. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("boots kissing the wet marble," "censers that had forgotten their prayers") that feels slightly over-adorned for the otherwise stoic focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information density is generally high, but specific artifacts mar the polish. The phrase "wrestling a larger stone to wrest from its socket" creates a distracting lexical echo. Additionally, the oxymoronic label "stoically sensitive" acts as a scaffold rather than an embodied trait.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept of a surveyor using structural repair to hide personal confessions is highly original and specific. It revitalizes the "letters never sent" trope by grounding it in a unique professional methodology and a surreal, submerged setting.</comment>
