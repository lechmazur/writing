<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and her transition from observer to active participant is well-charted. However, the shift in the colonists' trust is smoothed over; the "doubt" mentioned is resolved largely through summary competence rather than deep interpersonal friction or dramatized resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the passing-of-the-torch closure lands cleanly. The climax, however, relies on a montage of "forming chains" and "grandmothers anchoring ropes" rather than a specific, dramatized moment of near-failure, reducing the structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting integration is excellent; the specific physics of the planet (condensation, freezing dew, gravity) are not just scenery but tools that drive the plot’s central mechanic (the chalk messages). This elevates the setting to an active narrative force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are high (survival), but the escalation is somewhat linear; the opposition (fear of ghosts) melts away after a few successful interactions. The cost of the harvest is described poetically ("sweetness that stings") rather than felt through a hard trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story explicitly writes its moral on the sidewalk in the final beats ("family is the crop we keep replanting"), triggering a significant Thematic Echo penalty. This reduces subtextual resonance to a stated aphorism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, managing the shift from Mara’s perspective to the collective effectively. The tone matches the "fable" quality of the narrative well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative, but the specific phrase "brambled hope" is repeated three times, becoming a distracting artifact rather than a subtle motif. This repetition names the emotion rather than trusting the reader to feel it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost acting as an agricultural foreman to save a colony is a fresh, engaging synthesis of sci-fi and ghost story tropes. It avoids the standard "haunting" clichés in favor of a constructive, community-focused role.</comment>
