<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quince’s arc from a borrower of souls to a self-determined "first edition" is compelling and complete. The internal cost of his choice—the "terrifying" weightlessness of his own heart—is vividly realized, fulfilling the "visible cost" requirement. The "widow" and "astronomer" personas function effectively as conflicting impulses that drive the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative logic is tight, adhering to a consistent fabulist causality where the reversal of the press creates a decisive, resonant change. The closure is excellent: a physical action (turning the flywheel backward) yields a profound metaphysical result that resolves the plot while exacting a price. The drive lens holds perfectly from the inciting "vanishing stars" to the restoration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is a standout setting, integral to both the atmosphere and the mechanics of the plot (starlight entering the dome). Sensory details like "inked in moon-silver," "wet newsprint," and the "slow heart" of the flywheel ground the high-concept premise in tactile reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist's interaction with the sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from the intellectual puzzle of "transposing empathy" to the existential crisis of losing one's selfhood. The choice to reverse the press forces a clear trade-off: save the stars/souls at the cost of personal connection and fullness. The pressure is coherent and leads to a meaningful renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central theme of empathy as subtraction is powerful, but the ending diminishes its resonance by explicitly stating the moral ("to shine is to be alone together..."). The final paragraph explains the "mathematics of emotion" rather than trusting the cracked halo and the restored sky to carry the meaning, triggering the penalty for moralizing/summarizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The shift in Quince’s internal state when possessed by the astronomer is handled well through vocabulary ("eigenvalues," "vectors"). The dialogue is sparse and symbolic, which fits the mode, though the child's line is slightly expository.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and high-density, though it occasionally tips into overwrought metaphor ("eigenvalues of sorrow," "lucid turbulence"). While the imagery is generally striking, the relentless figurative language creates a slight "purple" texture that distances the reader from the physical action in moments. No loop artifacts or scaffold detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics with cosmic stewardship is highly original and executed with confidence. The central image of printing a halo fragment to birth a child of light, and then reversing the press to unmake it, feels fresh and memorable. The premise avoids derivative tropes and commits fully to its unique logic.</comment>
