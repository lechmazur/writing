<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira is a compelling focalizer with deep interiority and a clear, high-stakes motivation. The transition from a "scholar's quest" to a "daughter's promise" provides a strong internal pivot that justifies the final sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent with a defined beginning, middle, and end, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist alters her state of being. The causality is associative and dream-logic based, which fits the genre, though the mechanism of the "shadow unbound" manifesting remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "blooming library" and the "drowned world" create a vivid, specific atmosphere that serves the theme well. The environment actively influences the mood, with the orchid-shelves reacting to the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The conflict between the commodification of emotion and the preservation of authentic loss is sharp and well-dramatized. The cost is high—Mira's self-erasure—and is paid clearly on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of preserving "unshareable" emotions in a market-driven world is resonant and consistently developed. The ending lands the thematic argument effectively, though the specific phrasing of "luminous regret" is a bit heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. However, the verbatim repetition of specific descriptive phrases detracts slightly from the narrative distance and distinctness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative, but the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("softly, deliberately" twice; "luminous regret" twice; "metamorphose" forms three times) creates visible scaffolding that disrupts the rhythm. These echoes feel like checklist completions rather than organic stylistic choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi/fantasy premise (shareable dreams) with a mythic, melancholic tone is fresh and engaging. The concept of "cataloguing dusks" as an act of resistance is an original take on memory and loss.</comment>
