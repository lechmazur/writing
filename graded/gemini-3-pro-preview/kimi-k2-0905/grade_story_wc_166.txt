<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and poetic, driving the ritualistic action effectively. However, the protagonist's internal state is conveyed almost exclusively through high-concept metaphor ("hips forecasting surf") rather than embodied psychology, creating a mythic distance that dampens visceral connection. Internal conflict is minimal; her resolution is absolute from the start.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well for this ritualistic narrative, building pressure through the progression of verses against the sunrise. Closure is strong and resonant, delivering a decisive transformation (fledging words on skin) that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and consistent, establishing a vivid fable-like tone. Specific details like the "moonstone cabochon dust" and "night-blooming datura" ground the magical realism, though the setting functions more as a stage for the dance than a source of complex physical resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (memory vs. erasure) and escalate effectively as the sunrise approaches, acting as a natural clock. The cost is legible in the physical sacrifice of the moonstone and the pain of the inscription ("aching like cold salt"), satisfying the requirement for felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of embodied memory as resistance is coherent and well-integrated into the action. The final image of the skin-verse resonates with the premise, though the ending leans slightly toward explicit statement ("understood she had become the forbidden memory") rather than leaving the resonance implicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyrically consistent, fitting the mythic mode. However, the relentless density of figurative language occasionally suffocates the focalization, making the voice feel more like a stylistic overlay than a character's organic perception. (Capped by Q7 line-level density).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While polished, the prose suffers from significant metaphor density and occasional incoherence (e.g., "obsidian grace cutting her face into a crescent moon"). Mandatory phrases are sometimes shoehorned, disrupting syntax ("moment she first fledged—spontaneously anchored—at age seven"), and the reliance on abstract genitive constructions ("language of undertow") reduces clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central concept of dancing verses onto skin using moonstone dust is imaginative and visually striking. The synthesis of dance, poetry, and magic feels fresh, elevating the familiar trope of a memory ban into a unique ritualistic fable.</comment>
