<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maris is drawn with stark, specific interiority that grounds the surreal premise in character logic. The shift from passive observer to active agent is earned, and the specific emotional cost paid at the end—trading her own memories to settle the stranger's debt—gives her "eccentric" role genuine weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, moving from the inciting "gap" to a Decisive Change that feels inevitable yet surprising. The time-loop logic is taught efficiently through the reflection beat, and the closure—repaying the debt with personal memory—lands with distinct, irrevocable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting acts as an active antagonist; the "gaps" in the soundscape and visual field are a brilliant use of environment to drive the plot. The "softly persistent mist" and "opal dock" are rendered with high sensory specificity that constrains the character’s perception and choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is distinct and rhythmic, moving from external anomalies (gulls) to existential threats (the delayed reflection) to the climax of the stranger's return. The final trade-off creates a high-stakes resolution where the protagonist must sacrifice something personal to restore order.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a transactional burden is woven seamlessly into the plot mechanics. The final log entry, "Repaid," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, recontextualizing the lighthouse keeper’s duty as a metaphysical balancing act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, maintaining a lyrical intensity that suits the "nautical twilight" mode. The psychic distance is controlled well, allowing the surreal elements to register as grounded facts within Maris's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is lush and highly dense ("milk stirred with silver"), sustaining a strong mood throughout. A few metaphors strain slightly for effect (e.g., "fog hums in a bell"—fog typically dampens sound), but the rhythmic propulsion and sensory precision generally support the literary tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story with the concept of "memory debt" and sensory "gaps" is fresh and executed with ingenuity. The specific mechanism of the haunting—absence rather than presence—and the transactional resolution elevate the premise above standard genre tropes.</comment>
