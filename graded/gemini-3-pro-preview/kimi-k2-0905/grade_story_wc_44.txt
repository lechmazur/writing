<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyra demonstrates clear agency and competence, driving the ritual to completion. However, she lacks internal contradiction or a moment of genuine hesitation; her sacrifice feels inevitable rather than a hard-won choice between competing desires.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean causal spine where the ritualistic actions directly force the resolution. The closure is decisive and reconfigures the protagonist's status, though the linear progression meets little resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the observatory’s brass rings and the "spoon-smeared" sky are not just backdrop but the active tools used to resolve the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are globally significant and the cost of the protagonist's isolation is visible. The escalation is steady but lacks a sharp deepening of pressure or an acute "pinch" point where failure seems possible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The exploration of absence and memory is resonant, but the final paragraph explicitly explains the metaphor ("every shadow is only love bent into shape"), flattening the subtext into a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, confident fabulist tone that grounds the surreal elements. The transition from technical observation to mythic resonance is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("iris diaphragms widening like memory," "constellations poured like liquid"), effectively supporting the atmosphere without lapsing into purple confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The interpretation of "spoons bent reality" as a celestial phenomenon is inventive and fresh. The blend of clockwork mechanics with a shadow-fable feels distinct.</comment>
