<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is legible, but interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("bravely conflicted") and theatrical self-definition ("half ice, half fire") rather than embodied feeling. The protagonist's internal state is stated rather than dramatized through friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Decisive Change with the upload and re-freeze. However, causality is strained by the convenience of "secretly kept alive" wires functioning perfectly after decades of unmaintained dormancy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "melting snow on live copper" and "frosting breath" effectively ground the scene. The atmosphere is weakened by the rote repetition of the "dizzying quiet" phrase.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes (truth vs. suppression) are clear and the upload forces a permanent change. The lack of on-page opposition reduces the conflict to a mechanical task without immediate external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is consistent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("without honest memory...") rather than subtext. The ending monologue feels staged and didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is functional but disrupted by the visible insertion of prompt phrases ("blink that follows surprise") and telling ("bravely conflicted"). The tone slips into melodrama at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is marred by the repetition of "dizzying quiet" (three times) and the "blink" phrase (twice), creating a loop artifact. "Bravely conflicted" is a weak tell that flattens the emotional beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The cryogenic archivist concept offers a fresh image, but the whistleblower plot follows a standard trajectory. The resolution relies on a convenient technical loophole rather than a surprising character turn.</comment>
