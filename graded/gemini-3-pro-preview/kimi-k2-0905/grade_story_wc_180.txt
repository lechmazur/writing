<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct, but the prompt-mandated trait ("endearingly feisty") is applied as a label rather than dramatized through complex behavior. The internal conflict regarding the "forbidden" bag is resolved too quickly to generate character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative shifts from a grounded scene into a summarized life-history ("Years later..."), diffusing the tension of the graft. The causal link between the "breach" and the solution is smoothed over by convenient magical items.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard is a striking, well-realized environment that actively constrains the magic and the ritual. Sensory details like "plaster saints" and "striping aisles of air" are vivid and precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conflict is low-resistance; the solution (bag contents) is immediately available and works without complication or significant sacrifice. The "forbidden" nature of the bag is stated but carries no felt penalty or consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "deciduous vows" concept is integrated well, but the ending over-articulates the theme in the final paragraph ("reminding every passerby..."), turning subtext into text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the setting. The shift to omniscient summary at the end creates some distance but fits the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative ("metal bite bark like confession"), but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("muttered endearingly feisty curses") and occasional overwriting ("green applause").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of legal/contractual language with organic/cathedral imagery is fresh and imaginative. The premise avoids standard fantasy tropes by grounding magic in "apology" and "contracts."</comment>
