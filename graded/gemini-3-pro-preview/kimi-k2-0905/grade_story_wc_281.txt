<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characterization relies on expository summary ("Now she understood why...") rather than dramatized behavior. Mira encounters no internal resistance or genuine cost; her transition from skepticism to "willowglass hope" is stated rather than earned through struggle. The lack of a specific, on-page price for her success leaves her feeling like a plot device rather than a person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from a "magical science" causality break where ephemeral light paintings inexplicably transform into physical jewelry discs without logic or process. The ending dissolves into a summary of months of success ("helped dozens, then hundreds"), violating the requirement for an on-page closure scene with felt cost. The climax is a montage, not a dramatic beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The studio setting provides some visual texture ("beams of colored light"), but it functions more as a list of props than a pressure cooker. The environment accommodates the protagonist's needs perfectly rather than constraining her choices or forcing improvisation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the geode cooperates immediately upon the static shock, and the solution is achieved through a "working through the night" montage without setbacks. The stakes are theoretically high (global madness) but operationally zero, as Mira faces no antagonist, failure, or trade-off to achieve her goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit sermonizing in the final paragraph ("sometimes the most profound solutions come not from..."), reducing subtext to a moral instruction. The resolution offers a tidy, binary cure for a complex societal problem, lacking nuance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The voice leans heavily into the "helpful narrator" mode, summarizing technical details and backstory to bridge gaps in dramatization. The narrative distance is too remote to create intimacy, pivoting frequently to explain the science rather than inhabiting Mira's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>A severe repetitive artifact drags this score down: the phrase "fractally precise" appears five times in a short text, becoming a distracting tic. The prose relies on telling over showing ("The recall had been catastrophic," "Her breakthrough came"), flattening the momentum into a report.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of light painting and telepathy defense is an inventive premise, but the execution falls into the standard "magic object solves world crisis" template. The story avoids the risks of a down-ending or complex trade-off, opting for a safe, convenient resolution.</comment>
