<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina is a distinct focalizer whose internal conflict ("culture shock absorber" vs. resistance) drives the narrative. Her connection to the city is grounded in specific history (the grandfather's pier), and her final choice to release the stone chip effectively dramatizes her shift from preservation to evolution. The "dual allegiance" is stated rather than fully dramatized in scene, but her actions consistently align with her motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the threat of gentrification to a collective act of resistance. The closure is strong, employing a Conceptual Repricing where the city's survival depends on becoming "unreadable" rather than static. However, the climactic "reorganization" relies on dream logic that feels slightly convenient given the established corporate threat, and the transition to the result ("By sunrise...") summarizes the pivotal conflict rather than dramatizing the inspection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist/protagonist. The "raft city" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("painted prows," "popcorn smoke," "forgotten ferries") that actively constrain and enable the plot. The environment is integral to the resolution, as the city's physical mutability becomes its primary defense mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established early and escalate through the specific threat of the "stealth branding" and the inspectors' arrival. The conflict is resolved through active agency (the reorganization), and the cost is felt in the loss of stability and the admission that this is only a postponement. The tension between "survival" and "selling out" is well-maintained to the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of cultural fluidity as resistance is powerfully articulated without feeling preached. The motif of the "foundation" vs. "floating" lands a resonant closing image where the protagonist accepts that "becoming" is the only true survival. The graffiti codes serve as an effective subtextual layer that reinforces the theme of hidden communication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally lyrical and consistent, fitting the magical realism tone. However, the text suffers from a significant disruption in voice consistency due to a generation artifact (untranslated text) and some awkward phrasing ("walked orderly yet intuitive") that breaks the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the prose is often evocative ("calliope music ricocheted... like gulls"), the text contains a severe artifact: a string of Chinese characters ("like投射的火花") in the climax that disrupts the narrative flow and destroys immersion. Additionally, the phrasing "walked orderly yet intuitive" is grammatically forced, likely to fit a prompt requirement. These errors disqualify the piece from publishability standards in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a floating carnival city resisting gentrification through semiotic confusion is fresh and imaginative. The execution blends magical realism with socio-economic commentary in a way that feels specific and earned. The resolution avoids a standard victory in favor of a more complex, temporary survival.</comment>
