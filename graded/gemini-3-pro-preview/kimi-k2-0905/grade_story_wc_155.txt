<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Luma is a proactive protagonist who drives the action through competence, but she lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses. The emotional arc is smooth and linear; the "cost" of her actions is described metaphorically ("sigh of present sorrow") rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible with a clear causal chain and a distinct closure event (the shard dissolving into the mural). However, the "risk" mentioned in the denouement ("exposed by risk") is not effectively dramatized in the scene, making the summary of her internal growth feel slightly unearned by the plot events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral to the magic system; the fog and the "ruined orchard" provide strong atmospheric constraints. The sensory details ("bruised pewter," "vermilion cheek") effectively ground the fantastical elements in a specific texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Escalation is procedural rather than pressure-filled; obstacles (such as identifying the pigment) are resolved immediately by the Lattice without significant struggle or failure. The consumption of the shard provides a structural cost, but the lack of active opposition limits the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme is coherent and woven into the "film/development" metaphor, but resonance is dampened by explicit moralizing near the end ("She realized joy had never been lost..."). This summary statement flattens the subtext into a lesson rather than letting the final image speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and appropriately lyrical for the magical realist tone. The "Lantern Lattice" sequence demonstrates good control of the fantastical elements without breaking the established POV distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high image density and strong rhythm. A few images border on overwriting ("smelled faintly of fermented stars" pushes the limits of synesthesia), but the line-level craft generally supports the atmospheric intent well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of fresco painting, film development, and ghost-network magic is imaginative and fresh. The "Lantern Lattice" is a creative concept that elevates the standard "artist magic" trope.</comment>
