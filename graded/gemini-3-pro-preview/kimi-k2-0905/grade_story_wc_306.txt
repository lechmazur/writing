<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s agency is excellent; her decision to reject the standard transaction and leave unpaid constitutes a strong, character-driven pivot. The internal shift is well-supported by physical cues (the trembling hands), though the initial definition of her role feels slightly more conceptual than embodied. The interaction with the geologist effectively dramatizes the "crucible" requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from professional routine to moral disruption. Closure is definitive—a Resonant Reconfiguration where certainty is exchanged for doubt—with a legible cost (forfeited payment). The grade is capped by the ending, which relies on explanatory narration to summarize the resolution rather than trusting the image of the unhooked certainty alone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot mechanics; the wind chimes and lighthouse are not just backdrop but the tools of Mira’s trade. The specific encoding of the chimes (knots, seashells) grounds the abstract concept of "moral unease" in tactile reality. The atmosphere of salt and fog actively pressures the characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly defined: the destruction of the coral vs. the comfort of the researchers. The escalation is steady, moving from observation to a high-stakes confrontation. The cost is palpable on the page—Mira walks away unpaid, and the researchers are left stripped of their protective delusions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story handles complex themes of environmental grief and complicity well until the final paragraph. The ending explicitly articulates the thesis ("the most honest position from which any real decision could begin"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. This didactic summary flattens the resonance of the otherwise strong final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the premise. The POV stays firmly with Mira, filtering the world through her unique professional lens (reading chimes, sensing moral radiation). The "sincerely insincere" paradox is handled with distinct stylistic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative ("cracked lighthouse window," "pale thread"), but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally slows momentum. The simile "particles of doubt... like dust motes" explains an image that was already working. Some abstract phrasing ("nuance couldn't be welcomed... through logic alone") drifts into essayistic territory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "sin-eater" trope with the environmental lighthouse setting is fresh and engaging. The specific mechanic of the wind chime cipher adds a layer of ingenuity that elevates the concept beyond a standard allegory. The refusal to provide a tidy absolution creates a satisfyingly distinct resolution.</comment>
