<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vendor is a compelling, specific archetype whose motivation ("incise the day") drives the plot efficiently. The realization that she is the protagonist and the subsequent self-subtraction provide a decisive, high-cost choice that earns the fable-like resolution. While her internal life is more functional than deeply embodied, the clarity of her agency and the conceptual sacrifice fit the mode perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative operates on a consistent "dream logic" where the library's physical shifts causally track the vendor's sales. The closure is a strong example of Conceptual Repricing: the vendor removes herself to allow the narrative to nucleate, a cost that is both logical within the established rules and thematically resonant. The arc from transaction to transformation is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "glass orchard library" is vividly realized, with sensory details ("chimed," "obsidian floor," "scent of rain") that actively pressure the characters (the floor tilting, the clouds pressing in). The setting is not just a backdrop but an antagonist and a participant that evolves in response to the vendor's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict between the vendor's incisions and the library's narrative stability escalates clearly, manifested in the physical distortion of the building. The stakes are abstract (the birth of a story vs. its stasis) but rendered legible through the "weight" on the scale and the branches. The final cost—the vendor's existence—is undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "absence as the seed of story" is rigorously developed through the mechanics of the magic system. While the meta-fictional turn ("she had been the protagonist all along") approaches a trope, it is executed with enough specific imagery and consequence to feel earned rather than gimmicky. The subtext regarding the writer's erasure in service of the text is poignant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyrical tone that suits the fable genre without slipping into purple prose. The perspective is tightly controlled, filtering the surreal environment through the vendor's analytical yet poetic worldview ("algorithm of absence," "measurable drops").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally exquisite and dense with imagery, though occasional moments strain for effect (e.g., "spiral notebooks of storm" feels slightly mixed against the glass aesthetic). One sentence ("glinting with the same glimmering parole that shimmered") suffers from a cluster of repetitive light/vision verbs that dulls the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the "magical library" trope with a fresh, specific mechanical concept (selling absence to nucleate stories). The inversion of the vendor from observer to necessary sacrifice offers a satisfying, non-obvious angle on the prompt's elements.</comment>
