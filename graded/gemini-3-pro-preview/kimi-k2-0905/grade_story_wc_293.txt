<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fiddler serves as a compelling mythic archetype with a clearly defined motivation ("sculpt possibility"). However, her interiority is often displaced by heavy metaphor, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's conceit than a living person navigating a dilemma. The emotional cost (her father's memory) is stated but resolved through magical competence rather than difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative operates on a "Lyric" drive where music alters reality, which is executed with consistency. However, the causality relies on convenient magical connections—specifically the "scaffold wrap language" appearing exactly when needed to solve the mystery. The closure (dissolving into song) is resonant but leans heavily on dream logic rather than earned narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the surreal events in sensory details like rosined bows and cold mountain air. The transition from the physical pullout to the metaphysical bridge is handled well visually. The specific use of dusk light "developing" the valley is a strong, integrated image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conflict is abstract (Art vs. Entropy/Death) and the escalation is linear, driven by the intensity of the performance. While the stakes are ostensibly life-and-death, the lack of resistance from the antagonist force (the "never") makes the victory feel somewhat inevitable. The cost—her own dissolution—is poetic but lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "amnesty from never" is poignant and woven well through the photography/music synthesis. The story commits to its central question of reconstruction. However, the thematic reliance on "pixels" within a wet-plate collodion metaphor creates a slight anachronistic friction that distracts from the emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a hypnotic rhythm suitable for a fable. The integration of technical terms from photography and construction into a mythic register is largely successful, though occasionally the register slips into overwrought territory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant metaphor congestion ("ashes of never," "potter kneads," "frozen pixels," "scaffold wrap"). The density of competing imagery—digital, analog, construction, ceramic—often obscures the action rather than illuminating it. Peak beats become muddled by this figurative layering, reducing clarity at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of bridge construction, wet-plate photography, and fiddle music to tell a ghost story is highly original and inventive. The concept of "reconstructing" a person from a photograph via sound is a fresh, risky premise that distinguishes the piece.</comment>
