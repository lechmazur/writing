<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mila is a compelling protagonist whose internal state—longing cloaked in silence—drives the narrative. Her choice to stay and transmit during the raid demonstrates clear agency and commitment to her goal. The characterization is consistent, though her stoicism borders on the archetypal, lacking a moment of faltering or raw doubt to ground the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is well-structured, moving efficiently from the inciting broadcast to the solstice climax. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the world's rules are rewritten by the broadcast. However, the resolution—inspectors instantly neutralized by the music—leans heavily on magical realism, softening the tactical causality and physical threat established earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, acting as a participant in the story rather than just a backdrop. The specific details of the "ember alcove," the "rosin dust," and the "forgotten cellos" create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that deeply enriches the central conceit of dust learning to speak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and escalate logically as the solstice approaches and Mila’s preparations grow more daring. The tension of the weekly sweeps provides a solid baseline of pressure. The resolution, while thematically resonant, dissolves the conflict somewhat effortlessly, reducing the felt cost of the confrontation with the Ministry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of art's persistence and the transformative power of memory is woven masterfully through the imagery of dust and silence. The story avoids preachy exposition, allowing the "chord no baton had ever cleaved" to carry the thematic weight. The ending resonates powerfully with the premise of a story famine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the atmospheric, fable-like quality of the piece. The control over tone is consistent, maintaining a sense of "thistled calm" and reverence throughout. Narrative distance is managed well, keeping the reader close to Mila’s perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery. At times, the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought (e.g., "uniforms shedding ash like pages turning," "eyes reflecting paragraphs"), creating a density that risks obscuring the physical action in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of shortwave radio mechanics, orchestral history, and the physical medium of rosin dust creates a highly original magic system. The concept of encoding stories into musical intervals and using dust as a storage medium is inventive and vividly realized, setting the story apart from standard dystopian tropes.</comment>
