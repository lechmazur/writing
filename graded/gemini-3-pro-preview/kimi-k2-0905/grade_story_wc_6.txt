<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara is a coherent focalizer, but her traits ("gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion") appear as inserted labels rather than dramatized behaviors. The internal conflict is resolved too easily ("breathed it down") without visible struggle or cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vignette structure is sound, and the ending offers a valid Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara decides to shift her ritual from preservation to growth. The drive lens (Accumulative) holds, though the lack of present-tense obstacles limits the dramatic pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and central to the ritual, but the descriptions often veer into purple prose ("clouds... drifted like kelp," "obsidian lagoon"). The reliance on heavy metaphorical filtering distances the reader from the physical reality of the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are purely internal and retrospective; the "anger" rises and falls without forcing a difficult trade-off or altering tactics. While the ritual provides a framework, the absence of active opposition or immediate consequence keeps the tension low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("Mara believed... that scars could sing," "trying to prove that scars can sing") rather than subtextually earned. This didactic approach ("Thematic Echo") flattens the resonance and leaves little room for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly "writerly," prioritizing poetic conceit over character-specific perception. The narrative distance feels calculated to deliver the theme rather than to inhabit Mara's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Severe overwriting via simile overload ("like kelp," "like guilty fingerprints," "like a listening heart," "like slow bruises," "like cooled lava," "like sprinkler heads") violates the density check. These artifacts clutter the prose and obscure the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise of a firefighter daughter healing an arsonist father's legacy is solid, if familiar. The execution relies on standard "healing narrative" tropes and specific prompt insertions rather than a fresh, risk-taking synthesis.</comment>
