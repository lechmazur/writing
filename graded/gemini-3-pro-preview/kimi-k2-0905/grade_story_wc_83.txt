<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc from grief-stricken scavenger to sacrificial agent is compelling and deeply felt. The emotional logic holds the high-concept premise together, with the shift in motivation earned through specific, on-page realizations and a tangible sense of loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the story's internal causality. However, a significant logical gap exists in the setup: accessing a drifting observatory three miles above the desert via "maintenance shafts" from a ground-level refugee camp strains credibility and confuses the spatial reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively merges the technological with the mystical. Sensory details like the taste of the wedding cake and the "shattered ribs" successfully ground the surreal environment in the protagonist's physical trauma.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from the abstract hunting of "potential" to a concrete ethical realization and a final, fatal trade-off. The cost is high, visible, and paid in full on the page, creating a powerful and earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of harvesting "unlived lives" to fuel grief is handled with sophistication. The ending achieves a resonant reconfiguration, reframing the protagonist's death not as a loss but as a necessary perturbation, successfully landing the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently tuned to the character's melancholic desperation. The integration of technical jargon feels natural to the character's worldview, maintaining a stable POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery is often striking and high-density, such as "equations whose solutions could redirect missiles." However, the repetition of specific phrasing ("intangibly tangible," "intangibly real," "bleak exhilaration") feels mechanical and creates noticeable drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fresh and imaginative synthesis of drone warfare, quantum mechanics, and magical realism. The concept of "mining potential" from tragedy offers a unique and memorable lens on the familiar trope of the grieving survivor.</comment>
