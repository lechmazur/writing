<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mireya is a distinct, active protagonist whose engineering competence drives the plot. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic labeling ("logically emotional calculus," "logically emotional—let tears fall") rather than purely dramatized contradiction, which distances the reader at emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal arc, but the resolution relies on a "third path" that neatly sidesteps the central dilemma (shatter marina vs. release nightmares). The ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist succeeds completely with minimal cost (a worn key), reducing the narrative weight of the earlier threat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not just a backdrop but the instrument of the story's resolution; the pilings and ice actively constrain the protagonist's choices (the calving ice forces a tactical shift). The setting integration is seamless and drives the mechanics of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalated when the initial attempt threatens to shatter the marina. However, the climax dissolves the tension too easily; the shift to the "mother whale" frequency resolves the conflict without forcing the protagonist to pay the price established in the dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "teaching darkness to listen" rather than destroying it is resonant and well-executed through the mechanics of sound. The "sonic absolution" concept lands well, though the final image feels slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical engineering terms with lyrical descriptions effectively. The POV remains tightly focused on Mireya, filtering the world through her acoustic sensitivities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and sensory-rich ("teeth filed into frequencies," "micro-shrieks"). However, the integration of prompt phrases ("fleshly ethereal," "logically emotional") creates slight rhythm bumps, reading as inserted artifacts rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, acoustic science, and eldritch horror is fresh and engaging. The concept of using structural resonance to fight nightmares offers a unique twist on the guardian archetype.</comment>
