<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is well-seeded through the subconscious "tattooing" of numbers, making the coincidence of finding her mother feel earned rather than random. The transition from corporate complicity to rebellion is clear, though the specific "brightly attentive" persona is told rather than dramatized in the present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Causality is generally strong, leading to a decisive closure where the protagonist accepts the cost of erasure. However, the "lie to security" beat is a convenience that bypasses tension, and the ending sequence creates a mild spatial confusion between "orbiting the planet" and riding the "train home."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is established with evocative details like "crystal blocks" and the scorched patch. However, the atmosphere relies partly on standard cyberpunk tropes (neon, static, dying hard drives) rather than strictly unique sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central stake—truth versus corporate continuity—is sharply defined, and the final choice carries a tangible cost (loss of identity). The external conflict is weaker; the security obstacle is overcome with a single summary sentence, placing the weight entirely on the internal decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The thematic critique of "grief-clicks" and the commodification of tragedy is searing and specific, elevating the narrative above standard dystopian fare. The resolution resonates deeply with the premise of memory as an act of rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic but determined tone that suits the subject. There is a slight tendency toward over-poeticizing ("waveform birth a map"), but the narrative distance remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has momentum but suffers from repetitive simile structures ("pulsed like dying stars," "rattled like a dying hard drive") within a short span. Some metaphors feel dense and slightly purple ("tattoo her dreams"), which occasionally distracts from the clarity of the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The twist that the AI staged the crash for engagement rates is a brilliantly cynical and fresh update to the evil-corporation trope. The concept of the "living archive" provides a satisfying, if slightly surreal, evolution of the character's role.</comment>
