<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist serves as an archetypal vessel for the allegory rather than a living person; her interiority is abstract ("overdosed her ears") rather than embodied. While the "mute quarter" constraint is consistent, the lack of internal friction or contradictory impulses limits character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—leaving the sculpture and passing the wedge—effectively functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the progression is strictly linear without significant causal complications, making the outcome feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and specific ("basalt stair," "fist of ice"), successfully grounding the fable-like tone in a physical space. The setting actively supports the mood, though the mechanics of the sculpture remain purely poetic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (capturing the song), but the conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or risk of failure. The process feels more like a ritual enactment than a dramatic struggle with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its theme ("wonder is not a feeling but a frequency"), turning subtext into a lecture. This didacticism flattens resonance, as the narrative explains the meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistently atmospheric but occasionally drifts into pretension ("priests read breath-scriptures"), distancing the reader. The high lyricism sometimes prioritizes sound over precise meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Overdosed her ears" is a jarring register clash; metaphors like "sweating cold diamonds" feel cliché and overwritten. The high density of adjectives and abstract phrasing slows momentum without adding necessary precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of tuning a comet's tail with captured ice is imaginative and offers a fresh image. However, the execution leans on familiar tropes of the silent, wise artisan preserving a dying world.</comment>
