<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct, active protagonist whose internal landscape (guilt, memory) tightly integrates with the plot. Her decision to sacrifice the vial is a character-specific choice that earns the resolution with visible cost. The emotional arc from isolation to connection is well-rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent fable logic where the "magic" of converting scent to frequency is accepted within the established tone. Closure is decisive and resonant, though the arrival of the rescue sub feels slightly rushed in the sequence of events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but an active antagonist (the hush) and the eventual tool for salvation (the organ). The underwater temple is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details that constrain the protagonist's choices and shape the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate naturally as the air runs low and the temple resists the signal. The central conflict is resolved through a meaningful sacrifice (the mother's vial), ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves strong resonance, but the final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("proof that... a single voice... can teach stone to yearn"), which flattens the subtext. This didactic summary explains the theme rather than trusting the reader to feel the lingering image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like sci-fi piece. The tone manages the shift from despair to wonder effectively, maintaining a cohesive narrative distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong and evocative, but occasional images veer into sentimentality ("bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms" feels tonally jarring/twee). The line "sound thin as kelp" is a weak simile that distracts momentarily from the otherwise solid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio technology, underwater exploration, and synesthetic magic (scent-as-sound) is highly original. The premise feels fresh and is executed with imagination.</comment>
