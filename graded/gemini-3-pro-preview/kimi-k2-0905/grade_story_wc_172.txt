<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The character's duality—cruelty laundered through charity versus secret sentimentality—is efficiently dramatized. The final choice to swallow the sound rather than merely hear it earns a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting him from a passive observer to a permanent vessel of loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is tight, linking the backstory (manufactured drought) directly to the climax (the lull required for the egg). The closure is decisive and conceptually rich, with the destruction of the map and the internalization of the echo creating a lasting, felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the salt flat's cracks serve as the map, and the storm's electricity powers the release. Sensory details like "vanished reeds" and the "small crunch" of salt ground the surreal premise in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are internal but high, escalated by the approaching storm and the fragile nature of the echo. The pressure forces a stance crystallization: the realization that external preservation is impossible drives the protagonist to a transformative act of consumption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of preservation as a form of imprisonment ("amorality is just another cage") is powerfully executed without didacticism. The final image of the echo living as a parasite inside the man offers a complex, non-binary resolution to the central question of guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is authoritative and consistently lyrical, matching the mythic quality of the event. Psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on the protagonist's internal experience of the "fractured grace."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("calcified inside him like secret sentimental plaque"). A few functional filter verbs in key moments ("He understood," "he could see") slightly distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—the drought-maker using his own disaster to revive an echo via a storm lull—is fresh and ingenious. The resolution, where the philanthropist consumes the sound, subverts the typical redemption arc with a darker, more parasitic form of preservation.</comment>
