<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s internal state is clearly drawn, but her primary trait ("spatially imaginative") functions as a label for visualization rather than a tool for tactical problem-solving. Her emotional arc relies on asserted sentiment ("believing unused love might crystallize") rather than embodied contradictory impulses or difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a legible magical-realist logic, but agency falters at the climax when the film threads itself and the screen brightens automatically. The resolution relies on a soft magic system that solves the central emotional problem without exacting a tangible cost or forcing a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specific, effectively grounding the magical elements in the physical decay of the projection booth and auditorium. Sensory details like the smell of nitrate and the feel of the rusted reel are vivid, though the "wax" seal smelling of nitrate is a slight physical stretch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are personal but low-pressure; the conflict is primarily atmospheric rather than urgent. The escalation lacks grit, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure; the magical resolution comes smoothly after she performs the ritual, missing the tension of a high-stakes turning point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story relies on an explicit thematic summary at the end ("Love is never unused, only stored..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This direct moralizing flattens the subtext into a sentimental aphorism, replacing earned resonance with a stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and suitably lyrical for the genre, maintaining a coherent tone throughout. However, the narrative distance is uncritical of the story's sentimentality, and the prose occasionally leans into repetitive "writerly" phrasing (e.g., "hushed thunder").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from overwriting and a high density of straining metaphors (e.g., pigeons as "white sprocket holes," which confuses voids with solid objects). This figurative density slows narrative momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene's reality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of using psychometry on film in an abandoned palace is imaginative and fresh. However, the execution settles into a safe, sentimental mode where magic neatly heals emotional wounds, lacking the complexity or risk required for higher literary ingenuity.</comment>
