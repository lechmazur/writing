<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Miren is a distinct, competent protagonist with a clear objective and a legible internal landscape. The transition from grief to "ballast" is earned, though the internal conflict lacks sharp contradictions; her journey is more procedural and emotional processing than a struggle between opposing urgent needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, with excellent orientation in the opening lines. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren accepts the diffusion of memory as ballast rather than possession—lands effectively with conceptual cost (she cannot keep the specific memories). The logic of the magic system (gravity/salt) holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the gravity pockets are not just atmospheric but constrain movement ("boots sank ankle-deep") and shape the ritual. The "salt crystal growing chamber" and the whale's "steaming carcass" create a vivid, tactile environment that directly influences the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the on-page pressure is low. The conflict is primarily environmental and internal; the "city archivists" are an abstract threat, and the ritual proceeds with minimal resistance once initiated. The tension relies on atmosphere rather than an urgent, escalating counter-force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory as sensation vs. narrative is handled with sophistication ("not as narrative but as sensation"). The ending, while slightly sentimental with the distribution of memories to strangers, successfully reweights the concept of loss into one of stabilization ("ballast").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and atmospheric, but the POV distance wavers at the end. The shift to omniscient speculation ("Some would dream tonight... Somewhere, a child would inhale") dilutes the strict single-POV intimacy established earlier. A tighter filter through Miren’s speculation would strengthen the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from repetition and mixed metaphors. The phrase "gleaming silence" appears three times, becoming a distracting artifact rather than a motif. Phrasing like "scattering the gravity like broken glass" strains the physical logic of the metaphor, and the ending drifts into a list-like cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of whale beaching, gravity distortions, and memory deletion creates a fresh fabulist premise. While the "memories as light/dust" trope is familiar, the specific mechanism of the whale and salt chamber adds a unique, creative texture to the genre.</comment>
