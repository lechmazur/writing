<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rowan's internal grief coheres beautifully with his external goal; the shift from locksmith to custodian is a satisfying, character-driven evolution. His motivation to mend the universe to fix his own heart is compelling, though the connection is slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from failure to insight to resolution with clear causality under a hybrid lens. The closure—the door vanishing and the acceptance of the new role—provides a resonant, definitive change in status with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen library is an immersive, high-concept setting that actively shapes the plot; the mirrors are not just decor but the mechanism of the climax. Sensory details like "boots squealing on crystal" ground the fantastical elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict escalates cleanly when the standard tools fail, forcing Rowan to confront the mirrors' nature. The resolution requires a meaningful trade-off—collaborating with the illusion to fix reality—which carries a subtle but felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of embracing brokenness and the "rhythm of repair" is woven naturally into the action without becoming preachy. The final insight about forgiving the slipped gear effectively recontextualizes the protagonist's grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. However, it occasionally relies on adjectival density ("hauntingly bright," "frozen wave") where sharper verbs would improve momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting, such as the mixed metaphor "doubt hissed like thawing steel" and some repetitive cadences. While the imagery is strong, the density of figurative language sometimes slows the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a library storing "discarded drafts" of reality is inventive and freshly executed. The synthesis of clockwork mechanics with lunar mysticism feels organic and distinctive.</comment>
