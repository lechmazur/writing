<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation is clearly dramatized, moving from a desire to quantify to a willingness to exchange. The renunciation of the urn fragment—a cherished relic—provides a visible, felt cost that validates his internal shift. While the interaction with the boy functions well, the protagonist's transition feels slightly more like a guided realization than a high-friction struggle against his own nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The structure forms a coherent fable with a distinct beginning, middle, and end; the discovery of the capsule naturally leads to the climax at the market. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing, where the trade of the urn reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to time. The arrival of the truck is a mild coincidence that serves the theme, accepted here under fable logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "emerald silo" and "rusted loading gauge" grounding the surreal premise in tactile detail. The environment actively shapes the narrative, providing the vantage point for the protagonist’s epiphany about the "granular" nature of time. The atmosphere successfully balances the post-chronological surrealism with concrete decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and philosophical, escalating effectively as the protagonist moves from observation to the active trade of his most valuable possession. While the internal arc is complete, external pressure is low; the "strike" of the numbers is a soft constraint that lacks active opposition. The cost paid at the end is significant, anchoring the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of replacing quantitative measurement with qualitative narrative is tightly woven into the plot mechanics (the price tags). The garage sale concept serves as a perfect objective correlative for the theme, and the ending resonance—time as an exchange of sensations—feels earned by the preceding imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. However, the reliance on high-concept metaphors sometimes distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The tone risks becoming overly precious, slightly obscuring the emotional reality of the character's loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally strains clarity ("green wheat like an unabridged novel," "blood from a bitten minute"). While the rhythm is smooth, these strained similes distract from the sensory immediacy the story aims to convey. The writing is technically competent but draws too much attention to its own construction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-numerical world with the "garage sale of memories" is a fresh, poignant reconfiguration of time-travel/apocalypse tropes. The specific mechanism of using descriptions as currency elevates the concept beyond a standard "stopped clock" premise. It feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
