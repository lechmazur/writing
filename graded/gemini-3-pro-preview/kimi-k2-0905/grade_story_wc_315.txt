<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle between duty and intuition is well-rendered, culminating in a clear renunciation of her role. However, the antagonist/mirror figure (the older self) functions more as a symbolic prop than a distinct character, reducing the relational pressure to a solipsistic exercise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a legible shift in ritual (tallying releases), but the structure relies on a "test" logic explained explicitly by the dead instructor via radio. This "explain-everything" beat dissolves the narrative ambiguity and causality into a contrived lesson.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "nocturnal arbor" is a vivid, specific environment that grounds the surreal premise effectively. The parachute buckle serves as an excellent micro-setting element, grounding the high-concept stakes in tactile, scratched metal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly as the glider breaches the perimeter, forcing a binary choice. The resolution, however, hinges on a surreal identity reveal and a safe "passing of the torch" rather than a costly confrontation with the consequences of breach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The instructor’s radio dialogue ("your final test was never the watching but the choosing") is a textbook Thematic Echo that states the thesis directly, robbing the ending of implicit resonance. This moralizing deflates the complex tension built earlier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric but stumbles on forced phrasing inserted to meet constraints (e.g., the grammatically awkward "attentively inventive"). These moments break the immersive texture of the focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is marred by tautology ("remembering through muscle memory") and the repetitive overuse of the "soundless echo" motif, which appears three times. These artifacts clutter the prose and dull the momentum of the otherwise strong imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of a tree-bound skywatcher is fresh and evocative. However, the plot resolution relies on familiar "test of character" tropes and a "meeting one's future self" device that feels less inventive than the setting itself.</comment>
