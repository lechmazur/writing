<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist serves as a functional vessel for the mythic narrative, but the specific trait "inadvertently stubborn" is stated rather than dramatized in the present action; he complies with the dream summons immediately, contradicting the label. His acceptance of the "tenure" at the end is poignant but lacks prior internal friction, making the transformation feel destined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a strong fable-like causality, where the solution (burning the names of the dead) perfectly matches the problem (revitalizing the signal for the dead). The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's life into a permanent role—lands with conceptual weight. The "dream" beat functions as a weak causal bridge, but the climax and resolution are structurally sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with specific details like "pages of compacted salt" and "barnacled marble" that actively constrain the protagonist's choices (e.g., needing to burn the salt-pages). The underwater library feels lived-in and governs the logic of the story, charging the final image with significant atmospheric power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the conceptual stakes are high (the rest of unmoored souls), the immediate pressure on the protagonist is low; he solves the puzzle and accepts his fate with minimal resistance. The "octopus tenure" provides a form of situational pressure, but the lack of a difficult choice or significant obstacle dampens the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of providing a "permanent address" for grief is woven tightly into the plot mechanics and the final image. The transformation of the undertaker into a lighthouse keeper beautifully resolves the central thematic question, even if the "stubborn" trait was underutilized in this arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for a magical realist fable. However, the refrain "occupying impossible spaces" appears three times, feeling more like a repetitive scaffold than a deepening motif. The tone effectively balances the macabre with the serene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and imaginative but suffers from high simile density ("like a skull," "like overdue fines," "like processional candles"), which occasionally creates a formulaic rhythm. While the imagery is striking ("books breathing underwater"), the reliance on "like" constructions slightly distances the reader from the immediacy of the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the underwater library, the lighthouse function, and the undertaker's role offers a fresh, specific vision. The concept of "burning names" to fuel a lighthouse for the dead is an ingenious and memorable integration of character and setting.</comment>
