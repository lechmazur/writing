<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct focalizer with rich interiority, though her defining trait ("confidently uncertain") is delivered more as a label than a behavior earned through friction. The emotional arc resolves smoothly via the tool, bypassing the deeper struggle of living with the error.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent "problem-action-result" structure with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the "magic fix" nature of the pen slightly undercuts the causal weight, making the resolution feel more like a soft reset than a paid-for change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "comm-garden" and "gravitational anomaly" create a vivid, surreal texture. The physical grounding of abstract concepts (filaments, seeds) effectively anchors the slipstream elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (distortion of history/meaning), but the conflict is resolved with relatively low personal cost ("power borrowed," "gravity slackened"). The protagonist fixes her social/professional mistake too easily, missing an opportunity for deeper sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of narrative contingency is intelligent, but the text tends to explain its own subtext ("ink was metaphor up here," "interpretation is gardening"). This didacticism flattens the resonance that the imagery otherwise builds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, handling the surreal logic with authority. It successfully maintains a "cosmic fable" tone that suits the subject matter without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and evocative ("sprouted into static"), but occasionally lapses into "workshop" clichés ("tasted of recycled air and regret") or overwriting ("husk of error"). The meta-commentary on the nature of ink disrupts the immersive spell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept—editing reality by altering the "hinges" or contingent relationships between events rather than the events themselves—is highly inventive. It offers a fresh, specific take on the reality-warping trope.</comment>
