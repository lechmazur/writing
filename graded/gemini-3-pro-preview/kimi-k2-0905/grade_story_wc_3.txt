<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s internal landscape is rich, and her motivation to resolve her mother’s “haunted ambition” drives the narrative effectively. Her specific skillset (translation) is integrated well into her problem-solving method, though her “kindly methodical” nature feels slightly more stated than dramatized until the mother’s echo mirrors it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from ritual preparation to a surreal climax and a conceptual resolution. The logic of the world (grammar as physics) is established early, allowing the magical resolution to feel earned rather than convenient. The closure is a distinct Conceptual Repricing, though the resolution comes somewhat smoothly via the spirit's assistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the magnetic arbor is not just scenery but a toolbox Mira uses (iron filings, magnetic rails) to advance the plot. The imagery of the amber clouds and mirrored sky creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that supports the surreal tone perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and emotional; while the “arbor tilted” suggests physical danger, the pressure remains low. The resolution relies on a cooperative supernatural force (the mother’s spirit) rather than a difficult trade-off or high-cost decision from Mira, softening the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme is resonant and tightly woven into the mechanics of the story. However, the ending explicitly states the thesis (“haunted ambitions are just love...”), triggering the rubric’s penalty for moralizing in the final paragraph. The story relies heavily on aphoristic statements throughout, reducing subtextual mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, blending technical terminology with poetic abstraction (“notes that measured wind shear”). The narrative distance is well-managed, keeping us close to Mira’s perception of the world as a text to be read.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with high-quality imagery (“filings that stuck like frost”). There is a slight tendency toward “writer math” metaphors (love/time=velocity), but they fit the character’s specific worldview. Rhythm and flow are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics, physics, and grief in a sci-fi/fantasy setting is highly original. Treating a haunting as a grammatical error to be conjugated is a fresh, compelling angle on a familiar trope.</comment>
