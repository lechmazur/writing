<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya’s motivation is intensely specific, grounding the archivist archetype in personal grief. The internal conflict—betraying her own future potential to redeem the past—is dramatized through the tangible exchange with the lagoon, resulting in a felt, embodied cost ("years rearrange inside me") that earns the final decisive act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causally rigorous; the lagoon's trap forces a clear negotiation that drives the protagonist to a Decisive Change. The trade-off (future for truth) is established early and paid off in the climax, leading to a closure that permanently alters the world state (unerasable names) with visible social stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is not just a backdrop but an active, constraining agent that demands engagement; the description of "hot glass-grain" and the "grammar of shells" integrates setting directly into the plot’s resolution mechanics. The sensory details are vivid, specific, and functionally woven into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from physical survival to a profound metaphysical sacrifice. The "meaningful tightening" is literalized by the lagoon demanding specific pieces of the protagonist's future, ensuring the final triumph comes with a palpable, irrevocable price ("futures closing like doors").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a transaction is powerfully executed, avoiding abstract moralizing by anchoring it in the physical trade with the water. The ending resonates by recontextualizing the "burnt ink" of the past into a "searing reverie" that cannot be re-buried, offering a nuanced answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, solemn, and controlled, maintaining a consistent "archivist" filter even during high emotion. The shift from the intimate "parley" to the public broadcast is handled smoothly, though the required phrase "retrocognitively trapped" creates a momentary register bump against the otherwise mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong, original imagery ("missing teeth want their tongue," "scallop edges for vowels"). A few phrases lean slightly purple ("parted like a sigh," "dark petals"), but the line-level propulsion is excellent, and the integration of required terms is mostly seamless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "memory lagoon" that demands a "future" as a decryption key is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of oracle and time-travel tropes. The execution is specific and imaginative, turning a standard retrieval mission into a unique metaphysical puzzle.</comment>
