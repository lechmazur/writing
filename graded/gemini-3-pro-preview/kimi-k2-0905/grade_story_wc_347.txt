<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara is a fully realized focalizer whose internal conflict—hating the orchard yet faithfully serving its victims—drives the narrative. Her choice to destroy the nut (her mother's last gift) is a perfectly calibrated sacrifice that demonstrates her values under pressure. The emotional cost is embodied in action, not just reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed with clear orientation and a distinct causal chain: the frost necessitates speed, the deception necessitates a stronger signal, and the nut provides the oil to create it. Closure is excellent, landing an "Earned Stasis" where the protagonist pays a price to maintain the cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the cliff edge, the frost, and the mechanical birds actively constrain Mara's tactical options. The physical laws of the magic (heat transfer via stone) are established and exploited for the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (travelers' lives vs. time/birds) and escalate cleanly when the standard method proves insufficient against the "seven lies." The protagonist exercises agency by destroying a sentimental asset to solve the crisis, paying a visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "graceless beauty" and duty is well-integrated into the action, though the explicit statement of the theme slightly reduces the subtlety. The ending image of the crystal fossils resonates powerfully with the concept of permanent, unacknowledged sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending a weary, authoritative tone with the specific perceptual signature of someone who knows the labyrinth by heart. The transition from technical observation to lyrical internal monologue feels natural to the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative and high-density ("frost-brittle grass," "tasting iron and pine"). However, a few metaphors lean toward the ornate ("tiny white nooses," "prayers nobody taught them"), creating slight textural drag in an otherwise tight narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "heat-ghost" mechanic with the "nut-map" creates a fresh, tactile magic system. The story transforms standard labyrinth tropes into a specific, character-driven puzzle with a unique solution.</comment>
