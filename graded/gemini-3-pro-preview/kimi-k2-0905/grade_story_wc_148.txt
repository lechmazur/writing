<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cassian is a distinct, motivated protagonist with a clear internal conflict (truth vs. heritage). His internal state is vivid, though occasionally relies on abstract summaries ("motivation was not rescue") rather than embodied feeling. The resolution of his arc—accepting the "wolf" identity—is earned through the scene's progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic, ascending the lighthouse to a decisive conceptual closure. The "bodies" timeframe creates a slight genre wobble (police procedural urgency vs. magical realism), but the surreal logic holds. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the father's myth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and functional, with the lighthouse’s verticality and the "Fresnel lens" constraining the action and shaping the climax. Sensory details like "salt-bitten hinges" and "gull blood" ground the surrealism. Capped by Q2 (Global 9+ gate) but exemplary in execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Internal pressure escalates well as Cassian climbs, deepening the thematic conflict. However, the external stake ("before they find the bodies") feels tacked on and doesn't materially alter his tactical choices on the page, leaving the urgency feeling slightly artificial compared to the strong internal drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story brilliantly inverts the source parable, using the "lattice" to filter lies into truth. The theme of myth-making is woven into the action rather than just stated. Capped by Q2 (Global 9+ gate), but the thematic resonance is the story's standout feature.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, mythic, and lyrical, fitting the "tall tale" subject matter. However, the verbatim repetition of full phrases ("lattice from confessional," "copperlight repose") slightly flattens the narrative texture, making the voice feel occasionally mechanical rather than organic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the imagery is rich, the prose suffers from significant repetitive artifacting. Key phrases ("copperlight repose," "lattice from confessional," "the hush") are looped verbatim multiple times, creating a scaffold effect. Some metaphors are mixed and dense ("mouth still shaped around the final scream... slices the dark into slow-motion fins"), reducing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of the prompt elements, turning the "boy who cried wolf" into a generational myth about truth and storytelling. The lighthouse setting as a prison for liars is a fresh, evocative concept that elevates the premise beyond a simple retelling.</comment>
