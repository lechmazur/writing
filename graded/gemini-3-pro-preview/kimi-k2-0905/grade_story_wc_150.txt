<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as an archetype rather than a specific individual; her interiority is summarized ("realized the interrupted journeys were not hers alone") rather than dramatized through friction. There are no difficult micro-choices on the page; her actions (kneeling, singing, planting) meet no resistance and reveal no contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The narrative operates in summary/synopsis mode ("spent days purposeful wandering," "season turned") rather than establishing a concrete scene window with immediate pressure. This "outline-like sequencing" distances the reader from the stakes and violates the short-story scope by compressing a novella's arc into a montage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" and shadow-rebuilding church are imaginative, high-concept settings that anchor the surreal tone. However, because the story stays in summary mode, the setting is presented as a static list of striking images rather than a physical space the character must navigate under urgent constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (the boy helps instantly, the roots move themselves, the wood reassembles automatically). The resolution relies on magical assistance and dream instructions rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice, resulting in symmetric satisfaction without earned cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The themes of diaspora and reconstruction are coherent but delivered through explicit telling ("realized the interrupted journeys were not hers alone") rather than subtext. The mirrors reflecting ancestors act as a symbolic convenience rather than an emergent resonance, making the theme feel imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mythic, lyrical voice is consistent but creates a fable-like distance that prevents emotional intimacy. The tone manages the magical realism well, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("reluctant mouth," "cautious enchantment") that draws attention to the writing over the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose leans toward purple description ("fossilized petals," "thick as honey") and suffers from awkward prompt integration ("Across excavating a tomb..." is grammatically jarring). The repetition of "warmly curious" (for roots and then a smile) indicates a lack of editorial polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central image of a shadow reassembling a ruined building is a striking, original concept that elevates the familiar "diaspora return" premise. The execution, however, relies on standard magical realism tropes (moving roots, singing bones) that feel less fresh than the central mechanic.</comment>
