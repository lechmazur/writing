<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict (gift as curse) drives the narrative engine seamlessly. Her final choice to "sing the missing cadence" is a deeply earned character beat that resolves the central tension between stagnation and movement with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, with the echo mechanic perfectly mirroring the structural need for closure. The ending creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to her past is fundamentally altered, satisfying the closure gate completely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "breathing gallery" with transparent moths weaving sound is a standout, specific image that grounds the magic. The setting actively constrains the protagonist, forcing the descent into the "serpentine nexus" rather than serving as mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are personal and high; the physical pressure on Lira's lungs and the risk of becoming a "hollow vibration" create urgency. The climax requires a difficult emotional confrontation, satisfying the need for on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "unfinished departures" versus "complete goodbyes" is tightly integrated into the magic system. The resolution offers a profound, non-literal answer to the prompt's premise without descending into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and distinct, maintaining a mythic tone ("sentences too honest to speak aloud"). It wavers slightly only when accommodating rigid prompt phrases, but otherwise maintains excellent distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("tasted of salt and dawn"), though the insertion of the technical phrase "progressive disclosure" creates a register clash with the fable-like atmosphere. Line-level rhythm is otherwise strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The interpretation of echoes as "unfinished business" is a fresh, poignant synthesis of the prompt elements. The story transforms its components into a cohesive, timeless myth rather than a checklist assembly.</comment>
