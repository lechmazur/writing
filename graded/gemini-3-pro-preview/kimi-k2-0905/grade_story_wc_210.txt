<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The alchemist’s motivation is distinctly rendered through the specific cost of solitude; the refusal of the bottle is an earned character beat that defines their integrity against the "false comfort" of the wish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the burning ritual); the refusal of the bottle’s comfort creates a decisive, irreversible change in the town’s state that satisfies the "integrity of endings."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting acts as a hard constraint—only ash, paper, and wire remain—forcing the alchemist’s specific method; "wire ribs like whale bones" is a vivid, orienting image that grounds the surrealism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bottle’s physical reaction (heating, vibrating) effectively externalizes the internal conflict; the climax creates a visible cost (burning the unique scrolls) that resolves the tension under the situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory as active labor is distinct, but the ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("to conceive a civilization you must first..."), which reduces subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is authoritative and lyrical ("solitude teaches monologue"), maintaining a consistent, elevated register that fits the alchemist persona; the "I [verb]" cadence in the middle section mirrors the ritualistic action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory density is exceptional ("sulfur smell mixed with brine," "orange petals"); the prose rhythm supports the ritualistic pacing without stalling momentum, and imagery is consistently specific.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, civic duty, and papercraft in a post-wish setting is highly original; the concept of a "revival that refused to resurrect" offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on the survivor trope.</comment>
