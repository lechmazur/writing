<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira is a clear, consistent focalizer with a defined yearning ("sociable isolation"). However, her success relies on possession of a convenient object rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice; she gains acceptance without paying an emotional or tactical price, which flattens the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The resolution hinges on a convenient world-rule ("light-feed runs on stories") introduced at the climax to match the protagonist's inventory. This *Deus Ex Machina* logic dissolves the problem without cost or causal struggle, failing the closure cost requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, with specific sensory details like "brass ribs" and "flour-fine dust" grounding the airship. However, the mechanics of the ship (running on stories) feel like a late whimsical addition rather than an established constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The conflict evaporates upon contact with the solution; Lira faces no resistance, failure, or trade-off in the engine room. The absence of a "meaningful tightening" or "felt cost" leaves the stakes abstract and the victory unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of connection through story is coherent but didactic, articulated explicitly by the Captain ("You’ve given her a story") and the narration. The ending feels like a tidy moral lesson rather than a resonant, complex thematic reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Lira's cartographic perspective. The "fable" tone is well-maintained, though it occasionally risks becoming overly precious with its imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("creaking like an old librarian"). However, some phrasing leans into purple abstraction ("translations of light in seventeen dead dialects") that prioritizes sound over semantic clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise combines standard "cozy fantasy" tropes—magical airships, starlings, and stories as literal fuel—without subverting them. The execution is competent but follows a safe, predictable template for the genre.</comment>
