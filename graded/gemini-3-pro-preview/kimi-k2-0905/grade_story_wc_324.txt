<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira is a competent protagonist with clear motivation and agency, demonstrated when she outmaneuvers the Director. However, the "illicit thrill" trait is stated more than dramatized, and her internal monologue occasionally drifts into functional exposition to explain the world rather than revealing deep character idiosyncrasy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, leading from discovery to investigation to confrontation. However, the climax relies on a convenient off-page "upload" that deflates the physical tension, and the antagonist's immediate medical collapse acts as a deus ex machina to resolve the conflict without a final hard choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric blending of botanical and anatomical imagery ("vines had learned to mimic heart valves") is evocative and supports the premise well. The setting actively pressures the climax, with the koi pond and humidity playing tangible roles in the scene's choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are established early, but the escalation is undercut by the protagonist's pre-emptive victory (the upload) and the antagonist's lack of effective resistance. The conflict resolves too neatly, with the opposition literally crumpling rather than forcing Mira to pay a significant price for her victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of "incidental heroism" is relevant but handled with a heavy hand, relying on explicit summary statements ("heroism is rarely chosen; it is overheard") rather than subtext. The ending leans into moralizing, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a distinct melancholic mood appropriate for the setting. However, the POV distance occasionally slips into "filter" phrasing ("Mira heard," "she recognized") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally lush but stumbles on critical metaphors. Describing a voice as "calm as fibrillation" is a semantic contradiction (fibrillation is chaotic/quivering) that undermines the medical precision of the premise. Several similes ("slept like organ-donor coolers") feel strained and overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts" premise is a genuinely fresh synthesis of pandemic procedural and ghost story tropes. While the plot follows a standard investigative beat, the specific overlay of medical technology and supernatural echoes creates a unique narrative identity.</comment>
