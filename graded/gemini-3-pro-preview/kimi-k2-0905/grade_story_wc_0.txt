<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is distinct and tightly controlled; Mara’s interiority consistently filters the world through her scientific expertise ("preprocess reality," "molecular accretion"). The emotional arc from rigid intellectualization to acceptance is earned through the scene's action. Her contradictory impulses—using cosmic tools to measure microscopic decay to avoid dealing with human grief—create genuine depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is clean and effective, with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure that lands with conceptual cost (accepting insignificance). The convergence of the data (0.003% match) feels slightly convenient as a plot device, but it serves the thematic epiphany well. Orientation is immediate, and the causal chain is unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable, utilizing specific sensory details ("tasted of rotting orchids," "humidity... guilty conscience") that reinforce the theme of decay. The setting actively constrains the character, forcing her to work by headlamp when the lights fail, integrating the environment into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internal and philosophical, fitting the "strip drama" motivation. While the external pressure (approaching storm) is effectively established, the protagonist's deliberate choice to ignore it—while character-consistent—dampens the external tension slightly. The internal reconfiguration is the dominant and successful engine here.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thematic integration is exceptional; the link between neutron star decay and butterfly wing scales creates a cohesive metaphor for processing grief. The story avoids preachy moralizing, instead offering a resonant final perspective that recontextualizes the protagonist's loss as part of a universal process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is authoritative and consistent, maintaining a "researcher" filter even during emotional beats. The transition from technical observation to philosophical insight feels natural to this specific focalizer. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with strong density ("fractals," "cobalt fire"). There are minor cliched phrases ("thunder rolled") and the "synchrotron no larger than a lunchbox" is a quick sci-fi hand-wave that stands out in an otherwise grounded texture, but the rhythm and flow support the pacing well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and lepidoptery provides a fresh, non-obvious angle on the grief narrative. The premise is executed with specific, verifiable-sounding detail that elevates it above standard "post-apocalyptic greenhouse" tropes.</comment>
