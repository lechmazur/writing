<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and the surrender to the cave feels earned by her established motivation to heal connection. However, the lack of active resistance or a moment of agonizing doubt before the transformation softens the dramatic tension of the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to transfiguration with a Decisive Change that is paid for on the page. The closure is resonant, transforming the protagonist's state and purpose with a legible, permanent cost to her former life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and distinct, functioning as a character that solicits the protagonist through specific sensory details like "mineral tears" and "salt and iron." The environment constrains the choice and charges the final image, meeting the high-band standard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high, but the conflict is low-friction; Mara yields to the cave's pull without significant external opposition or internal wavering. The escalation reads more as atmospheric deepening than rising causal pressure, though the final trade-off is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken grief is tightly woven into plot and imagery, culminating in a resolution that offers a non-literal answer to the problem of loneliness. The "walls between hearts" motif resolves organically through the specific action of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the fable-like quality of the narrative. The psychic distance is managed well to reveal Mara's interiority while maintaining the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is lush and rhythmic, effectively establishing the dreamlike atmosphere. However, the high density of figurative language (e.g., "rainbows trapped in mid-sob," "rusted longing") occasionally borders on overwriting and threatens to stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of post-apocalyptic bureaucracy with mythic transformation is fresh and compelling. The concept of the cave recording confessions in stone offers a specific, poignant synthesis of setting and theme.</comment>
