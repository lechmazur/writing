<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyra is a highly competent protagonist whose specific expertise drives every beat. The pivotal choice to abandon the clean sine wave for the "warped field-recording" effectively dramatizes her internal shift from control to embracing chaos, earning the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the inciting signal to the escalation of "frequency hops" and the final tactical shift. Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration that recontextualizes the central action ("interference") with visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details like "burnt solder" and "sodium lights" ground the ethereal concept in a gritty reality. The setting actively constrains the plot; the "antique tower" and manual equipment force Lyra to operate within physical limits that heighten tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly visualized through the livestream feed, keeping the abstract frequency war grounded in human consequence. The antagonist's adaptation (frequency hopping) forces a distinct escalation in tactics, preventing a linear path to victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme is woven beautifully into the mechanics of the plot; the shift from pure frequency to natural noise (glacier) underscores the acceptance of human messiness. The final line offers a profound Conceptual Repricing of the story's central action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident and distinct, blending technical jargon with lyricism ("sly anagrams of constellations") in a way that fits the protagonist perfectly. The narrative distance remains stable, keeping the reader anchored in Lyra's competence and perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, with high information density ("velvet migraine," "chipped silver coin"). A minor slip is the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("ethereal grit") which feels slightly less organic than the surrounding text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio astronomy, small-town civic strife, and mythological "tricksters" is fresh and compelling. The resolution—using the sound of a calving glacier to combat cosmic noise—is a specific, ingenious choice that avoids generic tropes.</comment>
