<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist and ghost possess distinct, clashing voices that drive the conflict effectively. The emotional logic of the negotiation feels authentic, and the "chronological contempt" of the ghost creates sharp relational pressure. Minor deduction for the self-diagnostic label ("chronologically confused") which tells rather than dramatizes the state initially, though the gait detail immediately grounds it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality and internal logic are impeccable within the surreal frame; the camera mechanics and lagoon physics are established early and pay off at the climax. Closure is achieved through a decisive act (breaking the wheel) that carries a visible, irreversible cost—the loss of the undeveloped potential ("what we might have chosen").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but an active tool; the cloudwater screen and obsidian mare are essential to the narrative mechanics. Sensory details are vivid and specific ("smells of salt and burnt sugar," "silver glass"), grounding the surrealism in tactile experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate yet impactful, escalating clearly from a desire to map the past to a desperate need for reconciliation. The pressure builds coherently as the ghost rejects the protagonist's collected stories, forcing the final destructive choice. The cost of the resolution—shared erosion—is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of eroding ambition is woven deeply into the imagery and action. However, the score is capped by the explicit thematic summary in the resolution ("I understand negotiation is not settlement but shared erosion"), which explains the resonance that the image of the dissolving photos had already successfully conveyed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and melancholic, perfectly suiting the atmosphere. The POV control is tight, managing the surreal transition and the interaction with the self-ghost without confusion. The "we" moment during the reading of fragments is earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and evocative, with strong rhythm. A few metaphors border on overwrought ("seasoning the cloudwater with emulsified dreams," "bride who lost her vowels"), calling attention to the writing rather than the moment. The line "regret is just empathy traveling backwards" is memorable but slightly aphoristic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of elements; the specific mechanic of the camera wheel and the lagoon projection feels fresh and innovative. The story transforms the trope of "talking to one's past self" into a unique, visually arresting scene with its own rigorous logic.</comment>
