<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by static labels ("astonished," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than behavior, creating dissonance between the "astonished" tag and his tranquil, long-term habituation. While the final choice is motivated, the internal arc is largely told via these conflicting adjectives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a distinct physical act (sealing the fracture) that satisfies the need for a decisive change. However, the narrative relies on a dream sequence to convey the stakes of the fracture, bypassing dramatized causality in favor of a convenient information dump.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stained glass box and the spectral imagery create a vivid, specific atmosphere that grounds the fable-like premise. The sensory details of the apiary (ash, soot, sunlight) effectively charge the narrative mood and anchor the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fracture introduces clear physical pressure, forcing a decisive trade-off between the vow of silence and preservation. The stakes are legible and high, though the immediate blooming of the wasteland slightly softens the felt cost of the endurance he promises.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of preservation is clear, but the narrative relies on explicit thesis statements ("covenant was not a chain but a comb") rather than trusting the subtext. The resonance is earned through the final image, but the delivery is didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice aims for a mythic tone but is undercut by register-breaking diagnostic phrases ("contextual clues") that clash with the fable aesthetic. The repetitive tagging of the protagonist creates a robotic, unpolished effect that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "tranquilly perceptive" appears three times and "contextual clues" twice, creating a repetitive, templated cadence that signals a lack of line-level control. Overwritten phrases ("hush heavier than honey") occasionally reduce clarity in favor of ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central conceit of preserving ghost words in a physical vessel is highly imaginative and visually evocative. The synthesis of beekeeping and memory offers a fresh, specific lens on the ghost story genre.</comment>
