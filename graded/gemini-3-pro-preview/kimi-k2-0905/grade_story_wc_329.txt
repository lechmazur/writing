<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Calla functions as a competent archetype perfectly suited to the task, lacking the internal contradiction or flawed decision-making required for higher bands. While her motivation is clear, her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle or costly choice; she faces no genuine moment of doubt or conflicting impulse that defines her character beyond her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent fable logic, but the moment of "understanding arrived too late" creates a false beat of tension that is immediately resolved without consequence. The resolution relies on a convenient magical reconfiguration (gold dust writing instructions) rather than a hard-won structural turn, making the closure feel like a smooth descent rather than a decisive change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "trembling span" and "living statues" effectively constraining the protagonist’s movement. Specific details like the "clanking like dropped shields" and the bridge’s vibration anchor the fantasy in tactile reality, directly influencing the pacing of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are globally high but the immediate pressure is low; the antagonist (the statue) is bypassed on the first attempt with a single tactic, offering little resistance. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal where the protagonist’s plan fails or requires a painful adaptation, resulting in a linear procession to victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of organic beauty versus mechanical calcification is well-threaded, but the ending drifts into explicit moralizing with lines like "a secret handshake between flesh and forgotten wonder." The resonance is dampened by this summary explanation, which tells the reader what to feel rather than letting the final image carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, polished fairy-tale register that suits the material well. However, the POV discipline slips in the final paragraphs ("In the cities of iron below," "somewhere on a windowsill"), zooming out to a generalized omniscient perspective that dilutes the intimacy and tension of Calla’s specific journey.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imaginative, with strong sonic imagery ("gears chewing on silence"). A few phrases lean toward the ornate or synesthetic overload ("tasted of iron and apricot," "language of shimmer") which occasionally blurs clarity, but the line-level craft is generally strong and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk elements with orchard mythology creates a fresh aesthetic, even if the "music heals the machine" trope is familiar. The specific imagery of the locust shell map and the heart-rhythm mimickry adds a layer of ingenuity that elevates the standard fable structure.</comment>
