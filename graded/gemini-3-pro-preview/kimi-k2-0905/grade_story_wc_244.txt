<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kit is a distinct, voiced protagonist with a clear emotional baseline ("desperately jocular armor"). However, the summary-heavy middle distances the reader from his specific internal struggle during the station's transformation, turning him into a facilitator rather than a character in a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, and the closure (departure) is earned by the premise. However, the reliance on a montage bridge ("Word spread... They came...") to handle the escalation weakens the causal density, substituting summary for dramatized scene work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active participant that constrains and drives the narrative (the backward clock, the ivy spelling Latin). The environment evolves causally with the characters' actions, perfectly satisfying the high-band criteria.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes of loneliness are established early, but the conflict is resolved through a summarized process of success rather than a specific, high-pressure obstacle. The lack of a concrete "test" in the middle creates a smooth ride to the ending rather than a hard-won victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity is woven tightly into the plot mechanics (the moon rock, the jokes). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, letting the final image carry the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with the "fable" mode. The shift from the intimate opening to the broader summary maintains the tone well, though the distance prevents deeper intimacy in the second half.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative ("voice cracking like old paint"), with strong rhythm and density. Imagery is specific and purposeful, avoiding standard artifacts, though the density of metaphor is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of disaster-relief logistics with magical realism offers a fresh, specific take on the "magical station" trope. The "moon tax" and the specific mechanics of the cure feel inventive and non-derivative.</comment>
