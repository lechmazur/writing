<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s internal struggle between her skeptic past and present belief is compelled by specific, grounded history (the bone-setting). However, her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract labeling ("cleft in certainty") rather than remaining strictly embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from internal crisis to a clear Conceptual Repricing via the map ritual. The resolution relies heavily on the changeling providing the solution (the map) rather than Elara deriving it solely from action, but the closure cost—abandoning objective truth for a "healing lie"—lands effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("bruised mint and iron," "sundial carved from a vertebra"). The environment actively participates in the story, reacting to the protagonist’s choices and grounding the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (truth vs. communal survival) and escalate through the confrontation with the changeling. The tension is resolved through a distinct shift in stance, though the "map" device slightly eases the pressure of the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("every mistake is a seed," "constellations instead of scars"). This overt moralizing converts subtext into text, reducing the narrative's resonance by explaining the thesis to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable. However, the dialogue registers as artificial and aphoristic, serving the theme more than character realism, which creates a slight distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from high density and metaphorical clutter ("haloed by errors," "apology choking in smoke"). While evocative, the relentless figurative language occasionally obscures the immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The inversion of the changeling trope—where the fraud is a "tender" mercy that saves the town—is a genuinely fresh and compelling synthesis. The bone-setting metaphor provides a unique structural backbone to the concept of forgiveness.</comment>
