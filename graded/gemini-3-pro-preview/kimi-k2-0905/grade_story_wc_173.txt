<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lys demonstrates strong agency, specifically in the final refusal of the weaver's cloak to accept the burden of waking the city. Her motivation is clear, though her interiority is occasionally distanced by heavy metaphor (e.g., "pulse feel like betrayal").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a decisive closure where the protagonist reconfigures her role from servant to leader. The inciting incident and climax are distinct, though the "mad weaver" backstory feels slightly convenient as a tool source.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and dynamic, actively participating in the climax as the snow retreats and statues crack. The "prism sanctuary" and "silver courtyard" provide a strong, atmospheric grounding for the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as eternal conformity versus the terror of freedom. The pressure escalates appropriately, though the opposition is somewhat abstract until the tangible cost of "alarming serenity" lands at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of freedom as a terrifying ("alarming") responsibility rather than simple joy adds necessary complexity. The ending resonates well with this concept, avoiding a purely triumphant resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the forced insertion of required phrases ("bodily poetic") that disrupt the syntactic flow. The repetition of the "between sigh and smile" refrain borders on mechanical rather than rhythmic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heavy usage of repetitive artifacts harms the prose; "Between sigh and smile" and "bodily poetic" each appear three times in fixed positions, creating a visible scaffold. The density of adjective-noun pairings ("bruised violet," "arterial red") occasionally stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core narrative of a rebel waking a sleeping city is a familiar trope, though the "echo weaving" adds texture. The execution is competent, but the central conceit lacks a truly fresh conceptual turn.</comment>
