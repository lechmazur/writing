<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist has a clear motivation (reclaiming her voice), but her interiority is stifled by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases. The emotion "cautious exuberance" is a "label-only feeling" that tells rather than shows, failing to embody the complex state of the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>While the narrative arc leads to a legible closure (becoming the library), the progression relies on repetitive transition phrases ("Through propagation delays") rather than organic causality. The logic of the "confidence man's watch" affecting gravity is stated but not dramatized with clear cause-and-effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is initially evocative, but the verbatim repetition of "the glowing library in mist" (four times in a short text) flattens the setting into a static backdrop. The imagery is often abstract ("leather and gold," "pulsing tiles") without enough concrete grounding to anchor the surrealism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high (existence vs. silence), and the deadline provides pressure. However, the escalation feels artificial because the obstacles are overcome by the watch's magical functions rather than the protagonist's agency or sacrifice until the very end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through all-caps cipher messages ("I AM THE WORD...") which feels heavy-handed and lacks subtextual nuance. The concept of "unspoken words" is explored, but the execution relies on declarative statements rather than emergent meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is severely compromised by the rhythmic monotony of repeated full phrases ("Between two fateful letters," "The confidence man's watch"). This creates a "template cadence" that distances the reader and breaks the immersive dream-logic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from extreme artifacting: "Through propagation delays" appears four times as a transition crutch, and "cyclically reversed cycle" is a logical tautology that degrades clarity. The density of repeated 4-5 word strings violates the loop/scaffold rule and creates a mechanical texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a library of unspoken words is poetic but derivative of Borges-esque tropes. While the "watch counting lies" is an inventive touch, the execution is too formulaic and reliant on the prompt list to feel like a fresh, organic synthesis.</comment>
