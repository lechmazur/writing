<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marrow functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character with internal agency or conflict; she accepts the quest without hesitation or contradictory impulse. The attribute "weaves truth carefully" is asserted as backstory and a qualification for the task, but she faces no on-page choice where this trait forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear dream-logic progression, but the central causal mechanism—how analyzing cameos physically cracks a glacier—is asserted via rule ("Marrow understood the rules") rather than dramatized. The closure is a "task completed" success with minimal complication or unexpected cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, anchoring the surreal premise with strong sensory details like "formalwear stiff with rime" and the ship "folded inside a glacier." The environment actively shapes the imagery, providing a distinct, atmospheric container for the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conflict is largely atmospheric; the glacier "groans" but offers no active resistance, and the "digestion" of the ghosts serves as a timer rather than an antagonist. The protagonist meets no significant opposition or reversal, resulting in a low-stakes retrieval mission that feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit summary rather than implication, particularly in the lines about "wreckage can cradle light." The ending relies on stating the moral lesson directly, which flattens the resonance of the preceding imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and consistently atmospheric, suiting the magical realism genre. It effectively blends the technical (diving) with the surreal, though it occasionally relies on filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally dense with "purple" metaphors ("tasted like salt and forgiveness," "planetarium of collective sorrow") that obscure sensory clarity. There are no major technical errors, but the reliance on abstract descriptors reduces physical immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept of a wreck-diver navigating a glacier-ship via dream cameos is imaginative and fresh. While the execution leans on some genre tropes (singing ghosts, pure objects), the synthesis of diving and dream logic offers a distinct and memorable premise.</comment>
