<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a vivid archetypal figure whose physical form ("stitched... from maps") perfectly externalizes the internal conflict of grief. Her transformation from navigator to offering serves as a strong, earned climax driven by renunciation. While the "patchwork" nature is metaphorical, the physical costs (burning fingertips, weeping mercury) ground her agency in visceral reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the escalating phone calls, creating a flawless causal chain that leads to a definitive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). The logic of the ritual is established early and paid off without deviation, and the ending—where she becomes the geography—satisfies the premise of "reverse migration" with profound conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and strictly functional; the station’s rusted mechanics and the moon phase directly constrain the ritual. Sensory details like "cold iron," "rusted water," and the "smell of cedar and salt" create a tangible, immersive world that supports the surreal logic without becoming purely ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is exemplary, moving from mechanical repair to bodily sacrifice (hair, voice, then the self) in clear, time-stamped beats. The cost is unmistakable and rises with each step, and the dominant stake—the impossible return—is resolved not by success in the traditional sense, but by a transformative sacrifice that reweights the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "reverse migration as translation" is integrated into every action, avoiding abstract moralizing in favor of embodied metaphor. The closure offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief: one cannot return, one can only become the place that was lost. The final image of the white flowers is a powerful Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the mythic fable tone. The "rusted" and melancholic register holds steady throughout. However, the reliance on simile-heavy descriptions ("voice like," "shaped like," "light as") occasionally filters the immediacy of the experience, creating a slight distance in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there is a marked overuse of similes ("thigh like a bruise," "heavy as a coffin," "light as a letter," "veins like," "voice like"), often appearing in clusters. This syntactic repetition creates a template cadence that detracts slightly from the otherwise masterful execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial elements (hydraulics, signal station) with magical ritual (censer, hair soldering) feels fresh and specific. The concept of "reverse migration" via a radio signal station transforms standard tropes of grief and return into something unique and visually memorable.</comment>
