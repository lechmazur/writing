<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions primarily as a passive vessel for the theme, receiving explanations from the grandmother rather than driving the discovery through struggle. The reliance on epithets like "the thoughtful gravestone carver" creates distance, and the internal state is described with labels ("fiercely meditative") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>A significant causal break occurs with the "carved in sleep" revelation; roots wrapped around stones imply years of growth, contradicting the timeline of a recent mining accident ("griefs too fresh"). The solution to the mystery relies on this unestablished retroactive patch, weakening the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "thundering calm" of the greenhouse effectively grounding the magical elements. Specific details like the poem-wrapped chrysalises and the oak tree piercing the glass create a strong, memorable sense of place that supports the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic rather than visceral; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely following a spectral guide to an inevitable realization. The pressure is low, as the grandmother's ghost provides all the answers without forcing the carver to make a costly decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered didactically through dialogue ("You seek the shape of collective grief") and expository narration ("she understood... it contained not just her grandmother's memory"). The subtext is made explicit immediately, leaving little room for the reader to interpret the emotional weight independently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is disrupted by mechanical repetition of full character epithets and the phrase "spectral mentorship," which gives the prose a robotic, checklist-like quality. While the lyrical tone is consistent, the lack of varying sentence structures at key turns flattens the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Severe pattern artifacts appear in the structural scaffold; the phrase "The spectral mentorship [began/revealed/intensified/reached]" starts four separate paragraphs, creating a distracting template cadence. Additionally, filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "realized") distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The central imagery of chrysalises wrapped in poem fragments is imaginative and elevates the standard "ghostly mentor" trope. However, the "sleep-carving" twist and the guided-tour structure are familiar conventions that prevent the story from feeling truly novel.</comment>
