<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and visceral, driven by a specific trauma. The protagonist's internal state is embodied well ("holes that whistled," "memories leak out"), and the choice to sacrifice the mother's memory carries genuine emotional weight. Lira's sudden physical decline effectively dramatizes the cost of the transaction, though the shift to "witness" at the end feels slightly accelerated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong: desire leads to a specific high-cost trade, which results in an unexpected but logical consequence (cold silence). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the protagonist isn't "fixed" but changed, with the lost memory externalized into the setting. The ending feels earned, though the final explanatory realization slightly softens the impact of the image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" is vivid and distinct, with specific details like the skull-cradled apple tree grounding the surrealism. The setting actively pressures the character (roots tightening "like wires"), fulfilling the constraint requirement. The atmosphere successfully blends the macabre with the botanical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly articulated; the trade-off (mother's memory for trauma relief) forces a difficult decision. The cost is felt immediately on the page ("warmth exiting," "cool silence"), avoiding a cost-free magical fix. The tension holds through the climax, though the resolution comes quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of trauma and memory is handled well through imagery, but the story stumbles into explicit moralizing at the end ("I understood then that patching souls is not sewing shut but weaving new cloth"). This explanation flattens the resonance of the singing sprout, transforming a potent image into a stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately sombre for the setting. Narrative distance is controlled. However, the integration of prompt phrases ("fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve") occasionally feels stiff, creating momentary blips in an otherwise smooth textural flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative ("lighter than an empty coat"). There is some adjective stacking and abstract phrasing ("fiercely gentle urgency") that drags on momentum. The line-level craft is strong enough to support the surreal premise, but the prompt insertions are visible as seams.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a bone orchard where memories are bartered is a fresh take on the "memory shop" trope. The specific imagery of the tarot card and the root-wrapped skulls adds a unique aesthetic signature. The resolution avoids a generic "happy ending" in favor of a complex, symmetrical cost.</comment>
