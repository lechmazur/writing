<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's condition drives the narrative effectively, but the interiority often drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("limitation is not failure but filter") rather than embodied experience. The final epiphany about painting her own face feels conceptually imposed by the author rather than organically discovered through the character's struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the demolition deadline to create effective situational pressure. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the completed mural and departure), though the backstory of discovering the code "yesterday" feels slightly convenient for the timeline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "tree-trunk library" is a distinct, memorable setting that anchors the sensory experience effectively. Details like "iron-gall ink" and "living wood" create a strong atmosphere, though the "fractally precise" description borders on abstract rather than sensory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and irreversible; the cost—leaving the creation to be destroyed—is palpable and poignant. The external pressure of the demolition successfully forces the internal crystallization of her artistic intent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("wisdom begins with admitting what we cannot know") rather than subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the moral lesson directly, which flattens the resonance and violates the standard for high-end literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the artist protagonist, but occasionally overwrought. The psychic distance collapses into explanatory telling during key realizations, reducing emotional intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from a reliance on filter verbs ("she understands," "she realizes," "understanding finally") to deliver information. High-value moments are often summarized abstractly rather than dramatized through concrete action or image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness, a tree library, and a coin-guided mural is highly original and imaginative. The concept of a "negative space" portrait derived from tactile limitations offers a fresh take on the artist narrative.</comment>
