<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a distinct, competent archetype fitting the fable mode, but lacks internal conflict or doubt. Choices are procedural (enacting a ritual) rather than dramatic trade-offs; the physical cost (bleeding tongue) adds texture but the outcome feels predetermined by his expertise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>A coherent Accumulative arc where a ritual is enacted to completion, landing a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the landscape. While structurally sound, the causality is frictionless—the magic works instantly without complication—which limits narrative torque.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, specific sensory detailing ("flower-drunk sand," "roots cracking concrete") creates a strong, surreal atmosphere that grounds the magic. The setting actively pressures the ritual (the need to locate the "bloodiest acre"), integrating well with the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (healing vs. war's remnant), but opposition is passive; the environment yields immediately to the protagonist's agency. Pressure escalates through stated physical exertion and intensifying imagery rather than active resistance or hard choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of memory and restoration is coherent, but the ending veers into explicit moralizing ("conquest of every wound...") which flattens the resonance. The "submerged concord" concept offers a fresher, more complex subtext than the final summary permits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent mythic voice with a confident, elevated register ("dialect of seabird," "submerged concord") that suits the material. The recurring "narrow vastness" motif anchors the tone effectively, maintaining a stable distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lush, high-density prose with strong rhythm, though occasionally redundant ("coral... once been alive," "swayed like underwater kelp"). Imagery is inventive ("tiny coffins," "prisoners pardoned"), maintaining momentum through the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A creative synthesis of war, environmental collapse, and linguistic magic. The "gloom-hill" archetype and "submerged concord" feel fresh, transforming standard eco-fable tropes into something specific and strange.</comment>
