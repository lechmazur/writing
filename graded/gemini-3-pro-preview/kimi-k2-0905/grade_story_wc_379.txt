<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira is defined primarily by her thematic utility rather than internal contradiction. Her motivation ("prove that listening... is what finally heals") reads as a thesis statement rather than a visceral desire, flattening her agency into a vehicle for the moral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the shift from mechanical intervention (borescope) to communal witnessing constitutes a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The fable logic holds the closure, though the transition is swift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric grounding with specific, tactile details ("cool mosaics," "cracked ouds") that support the tone. The environment feels lived-in and effectively constrains the action to the courtyard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stakes are conceptual and communal rather than sharply personal, but the turn from active solving to passive endurance is a legible tactical shift. The cost is "felt" (time, cold, patience) rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its theme twice, including a moralizing aphorism in the final sentence ("locks exist only to teach us..."). This heavy-handedness removes interpretive space and reduces resonance to a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality. It occasionally risks becoming "writerly" with phrases like "living tissue of the courtyard," but maintains control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans toward purple description ("darkness breathing," "storm of rumor"). The density is high, though the figurative language sometimes draws attention to itself over the image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A competent, warm execution of the "healing magic" trope. While the synthesis of elements is smooth, the "love heals the haunted object" core is familiar and lacks a subversive or risky edge.</comment>
