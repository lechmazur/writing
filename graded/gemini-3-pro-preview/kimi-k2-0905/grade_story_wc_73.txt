<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal transition from mathematical rigidity to visceral intuition is dramatized effectively through the blood-sigma action. The refusal of the hand at step -1 acts as a profound moment of agency, rejecting the comfort of the past for a decisive, destructive closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The pivot from counting primes upward to counting negative integers downward provides a brilliant structural fulcrum that physically manifests the internal change. The closure—sacrificing the dice to rupture the prison—is a Decisive Change that earns its cost and reconfigures the reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The staircase functions as an active antagonist rather than a static backdrop, shivering and slowing in response to Elara's proofs. The tactile details—the cool stone, the uneven clatter of dice, the viscosity of blood—ground the surreal abstraction in sensory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tension escalates cleanly from the monotony of the climb to the existential threat of the stairs losing their motion. The internal conflict between seeking closure and fearing the "hollow shape of climbing" is resolved through the high-cost choice to destroy the setting itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mapping of regret to a "recursive function" and the realization of missed opportunity as "texture" creates a cohesive thematic logic. The ending resonates by rejecting the nostalgic trope of the "hand reaching back" in favor of a harsher, cleaner oblivion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice successfully balances the analytical detachment of a mathematician with the sensory desperation of the crisis. The register shift during the descent—"velvet-heavy," "almost rain"—matches the character's internal dissolution without breaking consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control, particularly in the "counting backwards" sequence. The required phrase "balancedly daring" is the only slight friction in flow, though the narrative self-awareness ("felt briefly authored") skillfully mitigates its awkwardness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the infinite staircase is a familiar trope (Borges, SCP), the integration of probability theory and the "negative step" inversion adds a fresh intellectual layer. The climax relies on specific character logic rather than generic escape tropes.</comment>
