<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marek’s internal conflict is clear, but the pivotal psychological shift relies on diagnostic interiority ("realized the... labyrinth... was not a lock... but a mirror") rather than dramatized struggle. The "fierce repose" is stated as a feeling rather than shown through action or sensory immediacy, slightly distancing the reader from the change. The connection between his guilt and the specific "suicidal" chess strategy is a strong character beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magical realist causality holds together well; the external unfreezing creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration matched to the internal release. The pivot point relies heavily on a sudden intellectual decoding of the tapestry, which feels slightly convenient, but the "righting of the king" provides a concrete, earned closure action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is vivid and functional, acting as a constraint that forces Marek to interact with static objects (tapestry, fountain) to find a solution. The sensory details ("cobblestones like thick felt," "steel-blue glow") effectively charge the atmosphere and the final release of the storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The internal stakes are well-defined, and the escalation from passive observation to decoding and finally physical intervention works well. The "suicidal" king move raises the stakes by framing forgiveness as a form of ego-death/sacrifice, providing a distinct meaningful tightening before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme is powerfully integrated through the chess metaphor, though the final line ("The board is wider than the mistake") leans into explicit moralizing. The concept of "reframing the game" serves as a satisfying, non-literal answer to the central problem of guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and suitably meditative, but relies on filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "understood") during the climax, which dampens immediacy. The perspective is stable, but the tendency to explain epiphanies ("game had been transformed into a diagram of acceptance") reduces the power of the subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("knuckles blanched," "suspended mid-tag"). There is a slight over-reliance on simile chains ("like prayer, like promise, like the beginning") that clutters the final emotional beat, but the density and flow are otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess notation as a woven code within a time-stopped village is a fresh, creative premise. The resolution—winning by accepting a "suicidal" position—cleverly subverts the expected trope of the genius tutor solving a puzzle to win.</comment>
