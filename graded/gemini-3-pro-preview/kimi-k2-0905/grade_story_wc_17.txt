<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira is a functional focalizer whose sensory skills drive the plot, but the coincidence of her lineage feels convenient rather than earned. Her agency is largely subsumed by the setting's trap, which fits the genre but limits character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The structural pivot revealing the building as a camera is brilliant, and the closure effectively consumes the protagonist. However, the coda's phrasing feels mechanical and lowers the resonance of the final conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, with ivy and dampness functioning as mechanical parts of the "camera" concept. Only the Q2 cap prevents a higher score for this exceptional synthesis of place and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is steady and atmospheric, moving from professional curiosity to existential annihilation. The stakes are clear, though the protagonist's ability to resist is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central metaphor of architecture as memory is strong, but the explicit repetition of "legacy's burden"—especially in the final paragraph—reads as a forced prompt insertion rather than organic theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently gothic and evocative, suiting the "dripping memory" aesthetic. The shift to the rescue team's perspective in the coda is handled with clean narrative control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush and sensory-rich, effectively supporting the surreal tone. A few metaphor clusters are slightly dense (e.g., "laughter a hollow skull"), but the style largely succeeds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of the building acting as a slow-motion camera developed by climate-shift storms is genuinely ingenious and fresh. Capped by Q2.</comment>
