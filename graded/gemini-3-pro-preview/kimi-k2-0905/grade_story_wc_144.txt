<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira’s competence is distinct and layered with specific sensory adaptations that define her agency. The connection between her past trauma and the drone’s "panic" grounds the technical solution in character history, earning the final success. Her internal state ("magnetic calm") translates effectively into physical action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight causal chain: diagnosis, failed attempt, innovative solution, and success, all driven by the deadline. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change that lands with the weight of Lira's emotional investment. The pacing effectively manages the countdown without resorting to cheap suspense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the glass drippers and water barrel are not just scenery but essential tools that allow the protagonist to operate. Sensory details are rigorously filtered through the blind protagonist’s perspective (vibration, heat, sound), creating a vivid and functional atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by both the ticking clock and the complexity of the repair, moving from a physical break to a software/psychological panic. The cost is paid in the protagonist's willingness to revisit her own trauma to solve the problem. The pressure holds consistently through the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of translating trauma into function ("terror into torque") is woven naturally into the mechanics of the story. The resolution offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, reweighting the initial concept of "repair" into something deeper and psychological.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a highly distinct perceptual signature, blending technical precision with lyrical sensory metaphors suitable for the character. The shift between internal reflection and external dialogue with Col is seamless, maintaining close psychic distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong momentum and specific imagery ("lumen-veins," "singing spectra"). A few phrases in the climax ("kissed the water," "restless confetti") lean slightly towards the ornamental, but the overall control and rhythm are exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan, bio-mimetic drones, and fluid-dynamic calibration creates a fresh and memorable specific scenario. The solution to the plot problem feels unique to this character and setting, avoiding generic repair tropes.</comment>
