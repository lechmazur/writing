<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara functions as a competent archetype (the mystical healer) rather than a fully realized character with internal conflict or blind spots. She encounters no genuine resistance, makes no mistakes, and pays no personal price, resulting in a flat trajectory despite the atmospheric interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent mythic logic with clear causality within its magical realism frame. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "anonymous package" inciting incident is a convenient deus ex machina that lowers the structural score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, acting almost as a character itself. Sensory details like "shingles bleaching from cedar" and "salt and cedar blood" effectively ground the magical elements in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story lacks visceral stakes or escalating pressure; Elara identifies a problem and fixes it in a linear procedural fashion without risk of failure. The conflict is abstract (House vs. Entropy) and offers no moment of doubt or difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "sanctifying absence" and "returning what was never truly lost" is developed beautifully and lands with emotional resonance. The core concept is integrated well into the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable-like tone. It maintains control over the magical realism elements without slipping into exposition, though the high-lyric mode is relentless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the imagery is rich, the syntax becomes monotonous with repetitive subject-verb openers ("She carried," "She paused," "Elara pressed," "She followed"). Additionally, the density of abstract similes ("like memory against bone," "like assembling a confession") occasionally feels overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "creeping normality noticer" is a fresh take on the seer archetype, and the ritual of using "insignificant" objects to heal houses is an imaginative synthesis of the prompt elements.</comment>
