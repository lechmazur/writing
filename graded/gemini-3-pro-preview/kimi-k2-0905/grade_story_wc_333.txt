<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is mythic and clear, though interiority relies on the repeated label "improbable longing" rather than contradictory, embodied emotion. The archetype sustains the fable mode effectively, and the physical sacrifice of the hair is a strong character beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Excellent causal thread with a distinct Decisive Change (absorption of the cub, physical scar) and legible cost (loss of name). The fable logic is consistent and the structural orientation remains clear despite the surreal elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "ivy leaves shaped like tiny keys" and the "keyhole that looked remarkably like a human ear" are vivid, genre-perfect details. These micro-settings effectively ground the surrealism in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear escalation to the mirror-breaking choice; the trade-off (surrendering her name to free the idea) is established and paid on the page. The stakes are internalized but dramatized through the external lock mechanism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ending relies on explicit thesis statements ("freedom is not silence," "I am no longer the locksmith...") which flattens subtextual resonance. This overt moralizing triggers the thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and confident, fitting the fable mode well, though phrases like "hush of cosmic possibility" skirt the edge of overwriting. The narrative distance is appropriate for the mythic content.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally high density, but "tumblers of fear" is a stock metaphor that weakens the climax. The triple repetition of "improbable longing" reads as a repetitive text artifact rather than a deepening motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A cohesive, well-executed fable; while the "trapped idea" concept is familiar, the somatic lock mechanisms (ear, hair, scar) offer fresh ingenuity that elevates the premise.</comment>
