<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s specific guilt regarding the mistranslation is compelling and grounds the surreal atmosphere. However, the drug-induced haze feels slightly like a device to justify overly poetic dialogue, and the boy's voice blends too seamlessly with the narrator’s own lyrical register.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc of deciphering the cast to forge a connection is structurally sound and moving. However, the closure—signing a medical discharge form with a poetic metaphor ("handle with tides")—strains credibility within the established "cordite" reality of a field hospital.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and precise, particularly the "clicking" droplets and the texture of the coral and plaster. The atmosphere effectively balances the clinical hospital setting with the dreamlike, misty twilight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The internal stakes are high, anchored by the specific memory of the massacre caused by a mistranslation. The pressure escalates well as the symbols on the cast reveal the depth of the boy's—and the narrator's—trauma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but articulated too explicitly. The narrator summarizes the lesson ("graft new meaning onto old wounds," "percussion of peace") rather than letting the scene speak for itself, leading to a didactic ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, controlling the dense, lyrical register well. However, the distinction between the narrator's internal monologue and the spoken dialogue is thin, creating a slight "monovoice" effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the imagery is strong, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "graft new meaning onto old wounds" in the middle and end reads as a scaffold artifact. Additionally, "lotus-hearted" appears twice, contributing to a sense of unpolished redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of a cast covered in scribbled confessions and coordinates as a palimpsest of war is highly original and poignant. It anchors the familiar "war trauma" trope in a fresh, specific image.</comment>
