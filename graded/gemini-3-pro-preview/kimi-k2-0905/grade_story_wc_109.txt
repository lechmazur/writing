<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist functions effectively as an archetype, but the specific trait "mildly obsessed" is applied as a label (twice) rather than dramatized through complex behavior. The "mild" modifier clashes tonally with the apocalyptic stakes, making the obsession read more like a prompt insertion than organic character psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building pressure through the dying star and the expanding map. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with clear conceptual cost—surrendering self to become the "first coordinate"—satisfying the drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is active and distinct, acting as a participant rather than a backdrop; the stones groan and the ridge shifts. The sensory details ("taste of iron," "pebbles that looked like eyes") are vivid and constrain the mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the dying star (time constraint) and the increasing weight of the booklet. While the internal conflict is minimal, the final choice to enter the map pays a tangible price (existence), securing the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of mapping oblivion and the cost of memory is handled with sophistication. The ending ("absence could finally orbit without longing") offers a strong, non-literal resolution to the thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a high mythic register. However, the verbatim repetition of phrases like "mildly obsessed" disrupts the immersive quality, reading as a mechanical insertion rather than a voice-driven choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Line-level quality is marred by significant repetitive phrasing: "ambered hush" appears three times, "marbled hush" twice, and "mildly obsessed" twice in a short space. These artifacts create a stuttering effect and synonym churn that undermines the otherwise lush imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a cartographer of silence is imaginative and the execution is competent. The recursiveness of the map entering the territory is a fresh turn, though the style leans heavily on standard lyric-fantasy tropes.</comment>
