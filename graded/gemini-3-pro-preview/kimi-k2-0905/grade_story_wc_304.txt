<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and poetic, driving the ritualistic action effectively toward a high-cost choice. However, the interiority leans heavily on lyrical abstraction ("city’s grief pressing against her ribs") rather than embodied, individuated friction, making the character feel more like a mythic archetype than a living person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc leading to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's state changes permanently. The closure is strong and earned by the ritual, though the pivot relies on a sudden epiphany ("saw her own face") rather than a forced tactical choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the aurora and pool function as active tools in the magic system rather than mere backdrop. The sensory detail is vivid and specific ("ice orchids," "dragon tear duct"), effectively grounding the surreal elements in concrete interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preservation versus oblivion—is signaled early and resolved with a definitive cost (the protagonist's life). While the price is paid on the page, the conflict is largely internal and atmospheric, lacking external pressure to test the decision before the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of beauty as a shield against death is woven well through imagery, but the ending suffers from explicit moralizing. The final sentence summarizes the lesson ("the only ferryman is the one who becomes the river") rather than trusting the closure image to resonate on its own, triggering a penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a high-fantasy, lyrical register that suits the fable-like quality. The POV remains tightly controlled, filtering the world through the mortician's specific, aestheticized lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative but suffers from high metaphor density ("like constellations," "like a held note," "like honey") that risks stalling momentum. The rhythm is strong, though the reliance on simile draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "beautician mortician" for dragons using static/bioluminescence is a fresh synthesis of fantasy tropes. The execution feels authentic to its premise, creating a unique, if slightly familiar, mythic vignette that commits fully to its tone.</comment>
