<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arden is a compelling focalizer whose "resiliently positive" trait functions as both a shield and a weapon in the climax. His choice to accept the "permanent transient life" is earned by the narrative arc, though the backstory about his mother feels slightly perfunctory and less integrated than his immediate drive to save the passengers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal loop involving the radio warning is executed cleanly, providing a satisfying "key" to the problem. The climax logic—where the constraint is to "choose" a timeline, but the action is "merging"—wobbles slightly on the specific mechanics of the cost, but the emotional closure is decisive and resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active; the use of "phosphorescent barnacles" as navigational coordinates is a brilliant integration of environment and plot mechanics. The "spectral grotto" imposes concrete physical constraints (closing stalactites) that force the protagonist's hand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are visualized effectively through the "flickering" passengers, grounding the metaphysical threat in immediate imagery. The pressure escalates naturally with the closing grotto, though the specific price paid—beyond the breaking of the hourglass—feels more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The themes of transience and the unseen labor of the "ferryman" merge well with the speculative elements. The ending reconfigures the protagonist's loneliness into a noble, if melancholic, duty without slipping into overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly weary tone that fits the magical realism genre. The perspective stays tightly anchored to Arden’s "tilting" worldview, effectively filtering the surreal elements through his specific resilience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm and density, but relies on a few "literary" clichés ("tasted like salt and regret," "moon dripped like melting silver") that dilute the otherwise sharp imagery. The "stalactites knitting together like fingers" is a standout original image that balances the weaker metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a commuter ferry setting with a multiverse crisis is fresh and engaging. The concept of time "slipping sideways" rather than just stopping or reversing offers a distinct angle on familiar time-travel tropes.</comment>
