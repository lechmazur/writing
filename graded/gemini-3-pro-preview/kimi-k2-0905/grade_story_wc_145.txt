<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, active protagonist whose childhood curiosity drives the narrative. The transition from dutiful cataloger to secret-keeper is earned through action, though the specific trait "dry-witted" relies more on authorial labeling than dramatized interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causally linked, moving from signal to discovery to a resonant closure. The ending creates a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist shifts allegiance from the Registry to the river itself, fulfilling the prompt's structural demands with high competence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the condensation spiral matches the geological formation, and the ice mechanics constrain the character's descent. The transition from the frozen surface to the bioluminescent estuary is vividly realized and functionally distinct.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between institutional control (The Registry) and natural truth. The escalation is steady, and the final choice to withhold data and release the map downstream carries a legible conceptual cost regarding her professional duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of connection vs. categorization lands effectively in the final image of the dissolving map. The story avoids heavy-handed moralizing, instead allowing the "rivers knitting themselves" image to carry the weight of the thematic argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent with the protagonist's observant nature. The shift in scope at the end—touching on the child and the cartographer—feels earned as a coda to the discovery rather than a POV violation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery ("puppeteered by warm air"). However, a few metaphors lean toward the conventional ("shattered mirror"), and the phrase "breath-born droplets" borders on overwrought, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics and hydrology creates a fresh, magical realist concept. The specific mechanism of the map dissolving to "teach" the water is an ingenious and poetic resolution to the central mystery.</comment>
