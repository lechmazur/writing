<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling, highly competent focalizer whose stoic reframing of death ("not a death sentence but a deadline") drives the narrative with immense agency. While her singular focus creates a strong forward momentum, the lack of visible internal doubt or conflicting impulses makes her emotional arc somewhat linear, though the physical cost ("hands shook") effectively grounds the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story masterfully employs a mosaic structure to cover the six-month timeline, utilizing a consistent Accumulative drive lens that builds toward a clear, resonant closure. The final "signing" of the treaty serves as a Decisive Change that reconfigures the world with a legible conceptual and physical cost (her departure/death).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is active and indispensable; the "living stone" and "conductive sinew" function as both tool and antagonist, satisfying the 9+ standard for environment constraining choice. Sensory specificity is excellent ("granite breathe like a slow lung," "fragrant resin"), grounding the magical realism in tactile logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are established immediately and escalated through the successful testing of the system (bats) and the encroaching physical deterioration of the protagonist (the tremor in month five). The pressure is coherent and steady, though the conflict is primarily man-versus-nature/time, lacking the sharp reversals of a more antagonistic setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of interspecies connection is woven directly into the plot mechanics ("treaty written in sap and ore") rather than stated abstractly. The ending achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the "ruin" becomes a broadcasting instrument of peace, offering a profound, non-literal answer to the premise of mortality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a "brazen calm" distinct to the protagonist, blending scientific precision ("micro-amp spike") with mythic lyricism ("fossilized lightning"). The psychic distance is well-controlled, filtering the entire six-month process through Mara's professional, surveyor-like perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful, with high information density in almost every line. A few metaphors feel slightly strained ("corridors bent like intestines," "teeth like yellowed parchment"), but the overall control of imagery and the absence of filler scaffold sentences support the high score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept—an orchard rewired as a bio-electric interspecies treaty—is a highly original synthesis of botany, magic, and engineering. The execution avoids generic tropes, offering a fresh, specific vision of legacy that feels inevitable within the story's logic.</comment>
