<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's shift from seeking knowledge to accepting the role of "keeper of lies" represents a profound internal turn earned by the scene's causality. The "agreed upon lies" concept provides a specific, poignant motivation for the relationship that embodies the loneliness rather than merely labeling it, satisfying the 9+ requirement for cost and deepening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure creates a seamless Resonant Reconfiguration, where the opening ritual with the tutor mirrors the closing ritual with Mrs. Chen. The inciting incident (interrogating the gargoyle) causally drives the revelation and the transfer of the seal, ensuring the closure lands with earned conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop functions as an active participant rather than a backdrop; the gargoyle and meteors directly constrain the lesson and facilitate the climax. The sensory details (wrought-iron, limestone, jasmine) ground the magical realism in a tangible, lived-in reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure creates a clear deepening of understanding; the tutor's departure forces the narrator to step into the teacher role immediately, foreclosing the option of passive studenthood. The cost is the loss of the specific connection, replaced by the heavy responsibility of the "stories the house had never told."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "agreed upon lies" is woven masterfully through the sugar, the lessons, and the final interaction, creating a cohesive subtext about urban isolation. The recurring motif of "stay" resonates powerfully as the emotional truth underlying the architectural metaphors, achieving a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical register that expertly blends linguistic and architectural terminology ("future perfect of load-bearing walls") without breaking character. The narrative distance is intimate yet controlled, perfectly suiting the "mysterious familiarity" tone and the magical realism genre.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished and rhythmically distinct, though the metaphor density is extremely high ("dactyls of fire," "eyes carried constellations"), occasionally bordering on preciousness. Despite this, the imagery remains consistently coherent within the story's established logic of "building grammar."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "dead language tutor" for buildings with the emotional core of shared loneliness feels fresh and inevitable. The execution transforms the prompt elements into a singular, emotionally resonant fable that transcends standard genre tropes.</comment>
