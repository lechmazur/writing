<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is sharply defined; the narrator's deception (architect vs. historian) creates a compelling internal friction that mirrors the external ghost plot. Mrs. Aldrich is drawn with economical but potent details, and the "student/teacher" dynamic evolves convincingly into a conspiratorial bond against time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structural pivot relies on the desk seal, which perfectly converts the accumulating atmospheric tension into a sharp causal realization. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the narrator accepts the "agreed upon lie," paying the cost of living in "borrowed time" to preserve the history.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting acts as a constraint and a character; the specific sensory details of the apartment (ink, lavender, old ledgers) ground the supernatural elements in tactile reality. The rooftop garden serves as a vital threshold space that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between preservation and erasure. The escalation is quiet but firm, moving from neighborly curiosity to a metaphysical commitment that forecloses a return to normal reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "agreed upon lies" is threaded masterfully through both the narrator's professional identity and the ghost's existence. The ending resonates without moralizing, offering a poetic synthesis of memory and architecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and precise, effectively bridging the gap between the mundane (sugar, demolition) and the mystical. The pacing of the reveal is controlled by the narrator's limited but growing understanding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("unraveled in silver threads," "stopped being counted") with high information density. The repetition of "patiently nimble fingers" works as a character tag rather than an artifact, though its verbatim recurrence is noticeable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the "ghost neighbor" premise is familiar, the specific angle of reading buildings as a language and the "architectural assistant" protagonist adds a fresh, intellectual layer to the emotional core.</comment>
