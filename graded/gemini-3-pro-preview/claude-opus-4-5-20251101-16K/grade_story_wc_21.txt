<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation to resurrect the silenced dead is visceral and specifically dramatized through her physical deterioration and obsessive focus. The shift from "solemn keeper" to active agent of justice is earned by the nightly toll of the connection. Her internal state is contradictory and embodied ("hollowed her," "sand beneath her fingernails"), grounding the supernatural premise in human cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: discovery leads to entrapment, which necessitates the inventive communication tactic, resulting in the actionable intelligence that drives the closure. The ending is a valid Decisive Change—moving from observation to intervention—anchored by the specific coordinates of the lagoon. The structure effectively balances the summary of the entrapment with the immediate scene of the parley.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The contrast between the "ochre and gold" view from the Zephyrine and the "obsidian lagoon" of 1962 creates a vivid, bipolar setting that constrains the narrative. The sensory details are purposeful, particularly the tactile elements of the dreamscape (driftwood, shells) which become essential tools for the protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between erasure and truth, escalated by Maren's physical wasting and the "searing reverie." The pressure coheres, forcing the protagonist to innovate (the beach debris method) to succeed. The cost is felt in her exhaustion and the burden of the knowledge she unearths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of history as a burning, active force rather than a passive record is well-integrated into the plot mechanics. The "obsidian lagoon" serves as a potent resonant image of buried trauma without feeling heavy-handed. The ending resolves the thematic question by choosing active justice over safe preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending the clinical detachment of an archivist with the lyricism of the supernatural experience. The transition between the zeppelin reality and the 1962 vision is handled smoothly, maintaining POV stability while conveying the disorientation of being "retrocognitively trapped."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density ("coordinates disguised as hymn numbers"). The rhythm matches the "searing reverie" tone, using imagery ("fever dream," "black as grief") that supports the atmosphere without devolving into purple prose. Line-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a steampunk-adjacent setting (floating library) with a civil-rights era ghost mystery is fresh and compelling. The specific mechanism of communication—arranging physical debris in a shared memory—adds a unique tactical layer to the "parley" element.</comment>
