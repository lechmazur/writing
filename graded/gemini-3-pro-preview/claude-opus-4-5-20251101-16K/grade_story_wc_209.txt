<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated ("quietly driven," "obsession") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in a specific scene. The character observes and reflects over months rather than making difficult choices under immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story violates the scope default by summarizing a full year ("autumn" to "spring" to "that autumn") rather than grounding the narrative in a scene. The climax is reported as a summary ("understanding crept into Elara's mind") rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "palimpsest of glass" and the nocturnal garden details are specific and inventive, providing strong visual grounding. However, the lack of a specific "now" dilutes the atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>There are no active stakes or obstacles on the page; the protagonist faces no antagonist or time pressure, merely the passage of seasons. The resolution comes without cost or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The ending explicitly sermonizes the theme ("Because darkness is not absence..."), treating the reader to an explanation rather than earning resonance through subtext. This didacticism flattens the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but distant, relying on "writerly" abstractions ("questions she could not speak aloud") and summary. It narrates the character's emotional state rather than inhabiting it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is mechanically clean but leans on heavy adjectives and sentimental phrasing ("visitors... wept without knowing why"). The reliance on summary verbs prevents scene-level momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The central mechanism of the etched glass revealing secrets in specific light is a strong, original image. However, the surrounding narrative structure is a generic, sentimental summary.</comment>
