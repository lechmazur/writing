<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Characterization is distinct, centering on a specific disability that drives the internal conflict. However, the epiphany—where Mira deduces Vane’s specific neurological condition solely from the texture of a coin—relies on an unearned knowledge leap that feels more like narrative convenience than genuine character insight. The internal shift is poignant but happens too easily given the magnitude of the realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, with the "ticking clock" of the demolition providing effective structural pressure. The inciting incident and climax (finding the coin) are causally linked, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of her disability—lands with clarity. The discovery of the book safe moves the plot efficiently, though the "book that is not a book" trope is slightly familiar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, with the "living wood" and "dust sifting" creating a tangible atmosphere that supports the urgency. The tactile details ("palm against the bark," "faint indentations") effectively mirror the protagonist’s sensory shift, integrating setting with theme. The environment actively pressures the character's timeline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The external stakes (survival/loss of history) and internal stakes (artistic validation) are braided well. The demolition serves as a functional clock that forces the protagonist to act. While the external conflict is environmental rather than antagonistic, it successfully forces a stance crystallization at the end with a felt cost (the loss of the library).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding "infinity within limits" is resonant and well-supported by the central motif of the coin. However, the story articulates its thesis too explicitly in the final paragraphs ("Mira understood now that... you first had to accept the walls"), which deflates the subtextual tension. This reliance on a "Thematic Echo" / moralizing summary limits the grade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the fable-like tone. The shift from visual to tactile perception is handled well within the prose. The certainty with which the narrator delivers the epiphany about Vane borders on omniscience, but the stylistic control remains steady throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm ("patient giants," "sawdust, and silence"). The required phrase "fractally precise" appears twice, which feels slightly repetitive in a short space, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and evocative without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a face-blind artist finding solace in a tactile legacy is a fresh synthesis of elements. While the "secret in the library" setup is a standard trope, the specific execution involving the coin's texture and the "tree trunk" setting adds distinct flavor. The resolution feels earned by the premise, if slightly rushed.</comment>
