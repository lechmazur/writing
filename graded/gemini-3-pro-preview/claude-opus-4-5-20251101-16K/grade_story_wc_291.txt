<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia is a compelling trait, but she operates with total competence and certainty; the scene lacks internal conflict, doubt, or a difficult micro-choice to drive character revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The structure is a static vignette (arrive, paint, leave) rather than a narrative arc; it lacks a causal turn or decisive change, relying on a projected future event ("Tomorrow") for closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the flooded quarry is not just atmospheric but integral to the protagonist's "negative space" technique, effectively constraining how she visualizes the subject.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract and retrospective; there is no immediate obstacle or antagonist in the quarry to test the protagonist, resulting in low narrative pressure and "competence porn" execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of empathy vs. forgetting is coherent but heavily didactic; the narrative explicitly explains the protagonist's motivation ("worked to awaken dormant empathy") rather than letting it emerge from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The somber, meditative voice is consistent and well-calibrated to the setting, though it leans occasionally on expository summary to establish the mother's backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative imagery ("quarry's shadows," "emerald satin") is weakened by some purple phrasing ("ancient with knowing") and telling adverbs ("worked very methodically").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a face-blind forensic artist painting the "essence" of cold case victims is a genuinely fresh and ingenious twist on the genre.</comment>
