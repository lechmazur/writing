<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s internal landscape is rendered with high specificity, and her shift from seeking a "frequency" of death to accepting "pauses" feels earned. The "grips reality loosely" trait is slightly expository, but her interactions with the relief work and the parasol ground her emotional arc effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, where small interactions (Kristof, the mitten) reweight the protagonist's understanding of the ending. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the decision to call is open, but the stance shift is decisive and charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, with the "creak of drift-ice" and "origami made of glacier" creating a distinct, pressurized atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The environment actively constrains and shapes the mood, satisfying the high-band requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are life-and-death, yet the conflict remains largely internal and quiet. While fitting the Accumulative lens, the external pressure is low voltage; the escalation relies heavily on reflection rather than forced trade-offs, keeping this in the high 7s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme is resonant, but the story relies on explicit articulation of its thesis ("endings rarely announce themselves," "simply pauses") rather than trusting the dramatization fully. This expository thematic echo slightly deflates the subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and meditative, perfectly suiting the "tourist of ending" concept. It occasionally verges on "purple" (e.g., "question made of metal and memory"), but the control of tone maintains immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, though it leans toward heavy metaphor density ("origami made of glacier and silence"). The craftsmanship is evident, but the reliance on abstract simile for emotional states slightly dampens immediate clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "euthanasia tourist" concept blended with disaster relief in a frozen landscape is a fresh, specific synthesis. The "tourist of ending" angle provides a unique lens on a familiar literary theme, elevating the piece beyond standard introspection.</comment>
