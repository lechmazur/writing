<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nadia's internal landscape is rendered with exceptional clarity; the geode serves as a potent objective correlative for her "hollow" state. Her motivation—grief sublimated into scientific obsession—is contradictory and compelling, driving the narrative without slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, framed effectively by the cooling circuit breakers which create natural urgency. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the use of the geode to sharpen the readings crystallizes her stance as a witness to the "ghosts," locking her into a path of isolation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is stark and integral; the floating observatory at 40,000 feet perfectly mirrors Nadia's detachment. The geode transitions from a sentimental object to an active optical tool in the climax, constraining the final vision and earning a high mark for utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tension is primarily internal and atmospheric, escalating effectively as the scope of the "unused potential" widens from personal loss to global tragedy. While the external pressure is low (waiting for a timer), the conceptual deepening drives the momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "ghost math"—unused potential as a physical force—is original and devastatingly executed. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead offering a complex, resonant view of grief as an accumulation of debt the universe refuses to pay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending scientific precision ("perturbation equations," "quantum substrate") with poetic grief. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining a "bleak exhilaration" that aligns perfectly with the protagonist's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("edges catching light like frozen screams"). The verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("intangibly tangible," "bleak exhilaration") is handled smoothly but feels slightly expository rather than organic in spots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of treating unlived lives as detectable quantum potential is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and war trauma. The execution transforms the trope of the grieving survivor into something scientifically rigorous and haunting.</comment>
