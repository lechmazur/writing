<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's "noticing" nature effectively drives the plot and investigation. The internal conflict regarding her own empty house provides strong motivation, though the specific prompt trait "inadvertently profound" is applied as a retrospective label rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from observation to realization to ritual action. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the house is "completed"—lands effectively, though the discovery of the physical "hush shard" resolves the mystery somewhat conveniently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Excellent specificity creates a vivid atmosphere; details like the fishermen's dialect softening "vowel by vowel" and the "dust motes hung suspended like questions" ground the magical elements in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent but remains low-stakes and atmospheric; the conflict is an internal negotiation with loneliness rather than an urgent external threat. The cost is felt (emotional recognition) but subtle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "accumulated tenderness" and the sanctity of abandoned things is developed consistently. The ending resonates with the established logic, even if "I see you" leans slightly toward the sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "hushed" intimacy appropriate for the subject. The shift into the slightly surreal logic of the house is handled with narrative authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery. Minor artifacts include the repetition of "daydreaming" for the streetlights and the somewhat clunky insertion of "inadvertently profound" as a direct modifier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept—sanctifying a space through "displaced objects"—is a genuinely fresh and compelling inversion of traditional haunting tropes, elevating the story beyond a standard ghost narrative.</comment>
