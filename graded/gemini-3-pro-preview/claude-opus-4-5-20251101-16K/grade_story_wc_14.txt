<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Miriam is a passive observer of her own process; she lacks internal contradiction or active desire that meets resistance. Her traits are delivered via exposition ("earnestly studious") rather than revealed through high-stakes choices or emotional trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural that explains a magic system but lacks a structural turn or decisive change. The ending is cyclical ("she would return"), failing to provide the Resonant Reconfiguration or felt cost required for effective closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and the incongruous fluorescent hum create a striking, specific atmosphere that grounds the fantastical premise. The setting actively participates in the protagonist's method, elevating the scene beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>There is no active opposition or escalation of pressure; the protagonist succeeds at her task without friction or cost. The stakes remain theoretical ("authenticity") and are never tested in the scene, resulting in a static narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of "invented histories" is poetic, but the theme is stated rather than emerging from conflict. Without a dramatic test of the premise, the thematic resonance remains intellectual rather than emotional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the tone of the piece. The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally slips into explanatory exposition rather than immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic with clear imagery, though occasional clichés ("pink snow") appear. The density is good, but the lack of narrative momentum makes the description feel slightly decorative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit—extracting time echoes from the hum of a fluorescent lamp—is inventive and memorable. It provides a fresh, specific mechanic for the "magical artisan" trope, effectively synthesizing technology and nature.</comment>
