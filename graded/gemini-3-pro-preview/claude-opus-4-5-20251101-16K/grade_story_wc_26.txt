<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clearly anchored in the grandmother’s legacy and dramatized through the choice between protocol (destruction) and adaptation (feeding). The internal conflict is resolved through a specific, low-key action that feels authentic to her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a causal lens, moving efficiently from observation to investigation (video archives) to decision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the threat is repurposed rather than destroyed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "Blooming Library" with paper flowers growing from spines is a vivid, specific conceit that actively tracks the passage of time in the surveillance footage. The atmosphere of "golden haze" and "twilight" supports the liminal theme perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (the loss of hope) and escalate through the realization of what the shadows consume. The resolution involves a meaningful trade-off: preserving the shadows by sacrificing unclaimed dreams, accepting change over stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of preservation-as-transformation is well-executed, avoiding a simplistic "good vs. evil" binary. The parallel between the flowing river (stone) and the evolving shadows adds depth to the central argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the setting. Interiority is well-balanced with observation, though the phrase "regret she couldn't name" is a minor lapse in specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic ("shadows stretching like pulled taffy"). The repetition of "softly deliberate" (a prompt requirement) creates a structural parallel between Mira and the shadows, though the phrasing itself is slightly cumbersome.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While "libraries of dreams" are a familiar trope, the "dusk noticer" role and the specific mechanic of shadows detaching via surveillance history offer a fresh, specific synthesis.</comment>
