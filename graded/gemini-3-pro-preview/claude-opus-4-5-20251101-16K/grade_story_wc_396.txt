<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vela is less a character and more a functional device for the client's epiphany. Her interiority relies on high-concept labels ("courageous anomaly," "shadow-laced") rather than embodied struggle or contradictory impulses. She faces no internal cost or difficult choice; she simply performs her skill without resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear vignette of a successful procedure lacking causal pressure. The logic of the revelation—that a dead woman’s memory crystal contains the current real-time location of a man lost for decades ("three days north")—contradicts the premise of reconstructing *past* memories. The mother could have simply written the location in the letter she sent, making the magical intervention feel contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The imagery is vivid and atmospheric ("apple trees growing improbably," "salt-tinged cold"), effectively grounding the magical realism. However, the setting primarily provides mood rather than constraining the protagonist's tactics or choices in a tangible way.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict. Vela encounters no resistance from the magic, the client, or the environment. The process works perfectly on the first attempt, and the "revelation" is delivered without obstruction. Stakes are stated for the client but are low/non-existent for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and diagnostic dialogue ("men of his generation were taught to swallow their pain"). The ending summarizes the theme ("This was what it meant to reconstitute...") rather than letting it emerge from the action, violating the show-don't-tell principle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but leans into self-congratulatory exposition ("mapped empathy onto action in ways they couldn't understand"). The narrative distance is controlled, but the tone creates a barrier to emotional intimacy by explaining feelings rather than evoking them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm. However, it suffers from abstraction ("mapped empathy onto action") and reliance on adjective-heavy descriptions ("shadow-laced," "courageous anomaly") that tell the reader how to feel about the character rather than showing traits in motion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "orchard on ice" is a striking, original image. The core plot—a magical medium healing a client's family trauma—is a standard fantasy trope executed here with safety rather than ingenuity. The story takes no structural or emotional risks.</comment>
