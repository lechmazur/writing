<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s internal state is legible, but her role as a "shadow keeper" relies on label-heavy exposition rather than dramatized complexity. The interaction with the girl resolves too smoothly, with the protagonist slipping into a diagnostic, therapeutic mode ("I let the shadows in") that feels performative rather than earned by the immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from isolation to connection and back to planned isolation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis, where Mira accepts the temporary intrusion. However, the inciting incident (the threshold fading) feels convenient, functioning as a plot device to force the encounter rather than a causal outcome of the character's actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "charcoal trees" and "skeleton of stone walls" create a vivid, distinct atmosphere. The sensory details ("indifferent stars," "ash") effectively mirror Mira's internal desolation, though the "loaded emptiness" descriptor leans into abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving solitude versus aiding the girl—is clear, but the conflict lacks resistance. The girl accepts Mira's teaching immediately, and Mira's hesitation is brief, resulting in a linear progression without a significant tightening of options or visible cost beyond the initial intrusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit sermons in dialogue ("The world tells us to chase light... but sometimes we need to sit in darkness"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens subtext into instruction. The ending summary further didacticizes the narrative, listing the lessons learned rather than letting them resonate through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, carrying a melancholic, lyrical tone suitable for the subject. However, it occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("breath, stubborn and holy") that distances the reader from the concrete reality of the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from frequent fragmentation and abstract nominalizations ("The suffocation. The drowning in air.") that create a staccato rhythm. While functional, the reliance on single-sentence paragraphs and "deep" abstractions ("presence of a different kind") reads as scaffold rather than dense, propulsive craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a reclusive healer in a ruined sanctuary is a familiar trope. While the "doorknocker ring" adds a spark of specificity, the execution follows a standard mentor/student beat sheet without subverting expectations or offering a fresh conceptual angle on trauma recovery.</comment>
