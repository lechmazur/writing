<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is deeply felt, and the shift from duty to personal intervention is earned by the specific memory of Celeste. The interiority effectively balances the metaphysical role with grounded maternal grief, though the &quot;tastes like endings&quot; beat is slightly vague as an internal trigger without a sharper external cue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the nature of the apocalypse from silence to song with a felt release of the puppet head. The logic of the &quot;pane of hush&quot; holds the Situational drive lens well, allowing the lyrical causality to function without confusion or unearned shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sensory details—&quot;copper,&quot; &quot;purple bruise,&quot; the tactile &quot;pane of hush&quot;—create a vivid, dreamlike solidity that supports the tone. The lighthouse feels anchored despite its impossible location, effectively grounding the abstract &quot;edge of the world&quot; concept in concrete interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stakes are successfully internalized; the &quot;wobble&quot; provides just enough external pressure to justify the deviation from routine. The escalation moves cleanly from observation to the decisive act of transmission, narrowing options to a single gesture of love that carries emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of &quot;tenderness over salvation&quot; is powerful, though the explicit articulation (&quot;Not salvation, but tenderness&quot;) near the end creates a didactic drag that explains rather than trusts the image. The resonance is better achieved through the action of the lullaby than the summary statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyricism that suits the fable-like quality of the story without slipping into purple prose. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, filtering the cosmic scope through her specific, embodied emotional loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery, though the simile &quot;beautifully flawed, like the universe itself&quot; leans toward overwriting in a high-leverage moment. The sentence-level propulsion is generally excellent, carrying the weight of the abstract concepts without stalling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the lighthouse trope with the &quot;doomsday clock&quot; mechanic offers a fresh, poignant angle on the apocalypse genre. While the core &quot;love transcends time&quot; idea is familiar, the specific mechanism of the &quot;pane of hush&quot; adds sufficient ingenuity to elevate the premise.</comment>
