<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kiri's interiority is rich, but her agency is constrained by the precognition setup; she enacts a script rather than making a high-pressure choice on the page. The transition from witness to participant is a conceptual shift, but the personal cost feels abstract and retrospective rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The central premise (friction disappeared) is directly contradicted by the physical action (kneeling on basalt, stacking rocks precisely), which relies on friction to function. This physics amnesia undermines the story's internal credibility despite the strong atmospheric setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the aurora and "silk" waves creating a strong sense of place. The visual of the eels mirroring the stones effectively connects the micro and macro scales of the environment to the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative lacks immediate opposition or the possibility of failure, as the protagonist is fulfilling a known prophecy without external pressure. While the intensity escalates (lights, rising eels), the stakes feel inevitable rather than fought for, reducing tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of connection and sacred geometry is coherent but delivered through explicit explanation ("instructions," "language the universe spoke") rather than subtext. The resolution offers a conceptual shift but feels slightly didactic in its delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining focus on Kiri's internal experience and perception without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery ("unspooling against glass") and good momentum. Rhythm is generally good, though the list of mathematical concepts ("Fibonacci... Prime... Golden") reads a bit like a scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of a frictionless world and an eel-herding oracle is inventive and creates fresh imagery. However, the reliance on "sacred geometry" and "star dust" as magical catalysts is a familiar trope in this genre.</comment>
