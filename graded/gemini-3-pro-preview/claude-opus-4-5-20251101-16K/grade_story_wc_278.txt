<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera’s defining trait as a constellation tattooist integrates beautifully with the machine's interface, grounding her magic in tactile reality. However, her internal arc resolves via external validation—the machine telling her "NOT YOUR FAULT"—rather than an earned internal shift, making the emotional climax feel delivered rather than achieved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The causal logic breaks at the climax when a 40-million-year-old insect conveys complex human psychological reassurance ("NOT YOUR FAULT") via sound waves. This anthropomorphic convenience undermines the established rules of the "haunted firmware" and acts as a Deus Ex Machina to resolve the plot's central tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "Laboratory of Lost Sounds" is realized with vivid, specific sensory details like "haunted firmware" and "spectral data" that elevate the setting beyond a generic backdrop. The environment actively constrains the plot, requiring physical interaction (the amber, the desk) to yield its secrets.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates effectively through the translation sequence, moving from physical needs to "PAIN," which successfully narrows Vera's emotional options. While the resolution lands with a conceptual release, the cost is relatively low—a symbolic leaving-behind of the amber—rather than a demanding sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story violates the "show, don't tell" mandate for theme by explicitly writing the moral in a note at the end ("The cries we cannot translate are not our failures"). This overt didacticism flattens the ambiguity of the grief and triggers a penalty for explicit thematic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic precision that suits the "between heartbeats" atmosphere without slipping into melodrama. The integration of the protagonist's background into the prose texture ("constellations connect to circuits") demonstrates strong control of the POV's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythm and high information density in phrases like "processors possessed by the very sounds they archived." A few phrases lean toward the abstract ("dissonance of old guilt," "meteor hush"), but the prose generally supports the story's gravity well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept of a sonic archive for grief is inventive and offers a fresh frame for a familiar emotional arc. However, the execution relies on the trope of a "healing machine" providing closure, and the insect's wisdom feels like a forced contrivance that diminishes the story's unique promise.</comment>
