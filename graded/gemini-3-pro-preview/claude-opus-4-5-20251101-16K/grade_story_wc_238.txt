<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vera is a compelling focalizer; the fusion of gossip columnist and medium creates a unique, cynical yet guilt-ridden interiority. Her guilt is physically embodied in the "tremor," and her choice to sacrifice her professional reputation for the truth demonstrates clear character agency and growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving seamlessly from the ritual setup to the confrontation and resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera repurposes her skills for healing, paying a conceptual cost (admitting the lie) that feels earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting strikes a precise balance between the physical (dusty archive, copper wire) and the atmospheric (impending destruction of the orchard). The "hush between what was and what would be destroyed" effectively frames the stakes and mirrors the transience of the ghost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict is sharp and personal; Vera's internal guilt is externalized effectively through the ghost. While the resolution (Eleanor's acceptance) happens relatively quickly, the pivot from defensive guilt to active remediation ("I could write one more column") earns the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" is woven organically into the plot and mechanics of the magic system. The story resists a tidy "happily ever after," settling instead for a messy, realistic redemption that resonates emotionally without feeling moralistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, distinct, and atmospherically consistent, blending noir cynicism with supernatural melancholy. The control of psychic distance is excellent, keeping the reader anchored in Vera's specific emotional experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and evocative ("burned through reputations like brushfire," "jasmine ghost accused her nightly"). The rhythmic control supports the tension, and the deliberate repetition of "imperfect" functions as a successful rhetorical device rather than a loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of a gossip columnist using pseudo-science to interview the dead is fresh and engaging. It revitalizes the séance trope by grounding it in a specific, gritty professional context and a clear moral failure.</comment>
