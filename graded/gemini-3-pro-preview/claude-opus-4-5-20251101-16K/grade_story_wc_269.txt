<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren is drawn with specific history, but her agency in the present moment is low; she primarily reacts to memories and a discovery made previously ("on a Tuesday") rather than driving the scene through active choices. The character work is reflective and internal, lacking the pressure of a dramatized dilemma to force a costly revelation in real-time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pivotal plot turn—finding the father's name and understanding his map—is handled via a summary flashback ("The delayed revelation came on a Tuesday") rather than occurring in the scene. This distances the reader from the causal chain and renders the present action static. Closure is an effective Earned Stasis, but the path there relies on exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting details are grounded and specific, particularly the repurposed parking garage and the aluminum desk, which anchor the speculative elements well. The "fog... trying to remember its own name" leans slightly into pathetic fallacy, but the physical environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's drifting state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conflict is largely atmospheric and internal, lacking a sharp tightening of options or immediate pressure. The stakes are thematic (understanding vs. despair) rather than dramatic; the protagonist accepts her role without facing a concrete obstacle that forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The connection between the father's crossed-out routes and the ocean's slow recovery is a resonant, well-executed theme. However, the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("indifferent to the desperate human need...") and omniscient validation of the coral's regrowth, explaining the subtext rather than letting the imagery carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, measured tone that suits the subject matter. The shift to a broader, omniscient perspective in the final paragraphs ("She wouldn't know for years") is a valid stylistic choice but slightly distances the focalization from Maren's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, using the tapping motif effectively to structure the text. There are moments of overwriting ("impossible purple," "periodically eternal dance") and metaphor strain, but the line-level craft generally supports the elegiac tone without confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of a lonely climate witness is a familiar trope, but the specific detail of the father's secret mapping adds a fresh, personal layer. The execution is competent and moving, though it stays within the expected boundaries of the "climate grief" subgenre without subverting it.</comment>
