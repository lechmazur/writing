<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Watcher and the girl function as archetypes in a fable rather than fully realized characters; the Watcher is a static healer device without internal conflict or cost. The girl's distress is generic ("tremor in her hands"), serving as a prop for the light show rather than a specific psychological struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the mechanism of the shutters and mirror creates a clear causal chain leading to the girl's release. The closure (Earned Stasis) lands effectively, though the backstory insertion about the mirror ("found it years ago") stalls momentum briefly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, with the light effects on the mist and water providing vivid sensory grounding. However, descriptors like "cobalt dock still wept" lean into pathetic fallacy that feels stagey rather than lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The stakes are high (implied suicide) but the resolution comes too easily via the "magic" of the light show, lacking a sense of difficult trade-off or resistance. The pressure is atmospheric rather than interpersonal or internal, resulting in a gentle but low-tension arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its theme ("teach darkness the value of stars") and moralizes in the final paragraph ("darkness did not have to mean alone"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for subtext. This sermonizing flattens the resonance of the silent interaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent in its fable-like quality but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("words gather behind teeth like floodwater"). The narrative distance shifts from the Watcher to the girl's internal need somewhat fluidly, fitting the mythic tone but reducing intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is competent but marred by forced phrasing and adverb abuse ("spiralingly calm"). While the rhythm is generally smooth, the reliance on abstract metaphors ("residue," "navigating human darkness") creates distance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of the dental mirror and shutters is an inventive prop choice that elevates a standard "wise healer" trope. However, the core dynamic is a familiar comfort-fic template without a subversive or fresh emotional turn.</comment>
