<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and the chronological homesickness is well-drawn, but the struggle remains largely retrospective; the protagonist succeeds in her excavation without facing a sharp, dramatized obstacle or making a difficult trade-off in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative drive is handled well, leading to a clean Resonant Reconfiguration at the ending; the closure lands with a coherent sense of cost (the return to the factory) and thematic alignment, though the narrative arc is somewhat linear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting of the glass spire and frozen lake is vivid and thematically essential, mirroring the protagonist's internal dissolution; sensory details like the "frozen mirror" and "amber shell" effectively charge the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the dominant stake (artistic integrity) is clear, the external pressure (dawn, exhaustion) is stated rather than felt as a formidable resistance; the lack of active opposition makes the escalation smooth rather than tension-filled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of time and reclaimed memory is resonant, but the execution relies on explicit articulation ("Time moves like this shell") rather than trusting the imagery to carry the meaning implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is assured and lyrical, matching the protagonist's sensibility; minor filtering ("she watched," "she felt") slightly distances the reader from immediate experience in a few beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high density; occasional familiar images ("pooled like water") are outweighed by strong, specific phrasing in the closure sequence ("sky and ice singing the same single note").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the mundane (fortune cookie factory) with the sacred (glass spire vigil) creates a distinct, memorable premise that elevates the prompt elements beyond standard tropes.</comment>
