<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional; the "crisis actor" backstory is not merely biographical but defines her method of interacting with the world ("acting was remembering"). The contradiction of being "benevolently ruthless" is effectively dramatized in her relentless extraction of memories from the dying, creating a complex, driven protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is masterfully executed, building density through the ritualistic walking until it culminates in the Resonant Reconfiguration of the chessboard. The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost: accepting the permanent absence of the pawns as the "truer statement" of history.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is integral to the narrative logic; the acoustics dictate the protagonist's physical actions (walking patterns) and the mechanism of her preservation work. The interaction between the space, the "nomadic penumbra" of the light, and the chessboard creates a fully immersive environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict between the encroaching "official history" (the coronation) and the fragile memory of the forgotten drives a quiet but urgent momentum. The protagonist's agency is evident in her choice to leave the chessboard broken, a renunciation that sharpens her stance against the incoming regime.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of preserving small gestures is resonant and deeply woven into the imagery, particularly the empty chessboard. While the thesis is stated somewhat explicitly ("History was incomplete"), the emotional weight of the ending earns this realization without feeling overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly matching the atmospheric tension of the interregnum. The rhythmic cadence of the list of names and the protagonist's movements creates a cohesive textual texture that enhances the ritualistic feel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished and evocative, with striking imagery like "darkness traveled... like a slow pilgrim." A slight reliance on simile constructions ("like hollow towers," "like an equation") prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft is otherwise precise and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a crisis actor survivor acting as an acoustic historian during a political interregnum—is fresh and memorable. The narrative avoids generic tropes of rebellion, offering instead a specific, nuanced form of resistance through memory.</comment>
