<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is a competent focalizer with a clear objective, though her motivation ("survival") feels more stated than dramatized via immediate threat. Her interiority leans into philosophical summary rather than embodied struggle, making the emotional stakes of the epiphany feel intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path with a functional Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (city isn't dead, it's waiting). The central turn relies on a rapid internal epiphany that unlocks the solution without a "try-fail" cycle, making the victory feel slightly low-friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vespera is a vivid, specific environment that successfully grounds the "fantasy practicality" tone; the cables and gorge create excellent verticality. The tools (compass to yesterday, cathedral bells) act as effective micro-settings that constrain and color the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake is intellectual discovery; while atmospheric tension is high, the on-page opposition is minimal, and the cost of success (using the fragment) is a transaction rather than a painful sacrifice. The "survival" stakes mentioned in the opening are not tested by the plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The themes of memory, silence, and transition cohere well, particularly through the Clara Vance prop. The ending relies on explicit thematic summary ("Which meant... it was also just beginning") rather than trusting the final image to carry the resonance alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the atmospheric premise. The shift to the collective "We" of the city is handled smoothly without disorienting head-hopping, reinforcing the "transcendence" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. The required phrase "serenely electric" appears twice in identical form, creating a minor repetitive echo that momentarily breaks the immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "Hollywood star fragment" (terrazzo and brass) with celestial radio interpretation is a fresh, specific invention. The "silence is the signal" trope is familiar, but the execution through the specific prop adds a unique textural layer.</comment>
