<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and the grief is palpable, but the interiority relies on abstract summaries ("physics of letting go") rather than purely embodied experience. The character's "spatial gift" feels more like a metaphorical label than a lived constraint on behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A strong Accumulative arc that builds density toward a resonant closure. The choice to leave the button acts as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), effectively anchoring the internal journey in physical action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent farm is vivid and inextricably linked to the narrative logic. The physical properties of the setting (permeable membranes) directly enable the protagonist's epiphany, integrating world and theme well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Internal pressure escalates coherently through the encounter with memory, leading to a distinct release. While the stakes are purely emotional, the cost of leaving the talisman is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit questions and answers in the narration ("glowed their patient answer") rather than subtext. The text explains its own metaphors, reducing interpretative depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a distinct melancholic texture. However, it occasionally drifts into a didactic register to ensure the reader grasps the "barriers vs. filters" concept.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with good density. Some imagery leans into pathetic fallacy ("mushrooms glowed their patient answer") or slight overwriting ("quiet wildfire"), but the line-level control is generally high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A graceful synthesis of technical security jargon and organic allegory. While the "grief in a sci-fi setting" frame is familiar, the specific fusion of intrusion detection and mycelial permeability feels fresh.</comment>
