<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira functions as a static, flawless expert guide rather than a character under pressure; she lacks internal contradiction, personal stakes, or potential for failure. Her role is purely catalytic for the secondary character, resulting in a "competence porn" dynamic where she pays no emotional cost for the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, legible situational arc (boarding to debarking) with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the passenger's state at closure. While structurally sound and well-oriented, the lack of resistance or complication makes the trajectory feel predictable and frictionless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and storm glass are vivid, specific, and functionally integrated, acting as tools that constrain the pacing and focus of the encounter. The environment actively mirrors the internal states, elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is low-intensity and largely internal to the secondary character; Mira faces no genuine opposition, and the passenger's resistance yields quickly to verbal explanation. The stakes remain abstract and professional rather than visceral, lacking a moment of doubt or high-risk decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Silence is absence... presence") rather than emerging organically through subtext or action. This didactic approach ("My work isn't to extract your story") flattens the resonance and leaves little room for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into abstract sermonizing ("solving for peace"). The POV remains stable, effectively filtering the world through Mira's professional expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rich in imagery ("fractured into ribbons"), though it occasionally leans on clichés ("pooled like water") or heavy-handed modifiers ("fluidly logical"). The rhythm is generally strong, supporting the contemplative tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>A competent execution of the "emotional ferryman" trope that relies on safe, therapeutic dialogue patterns. While the aesthetic is pleasing, the story takes few risks and creates a familiar, comfortable resolution without subversive edge.</comment>
