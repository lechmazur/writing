<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vela is a capable, distinct protagonist whose professional expertise drives the narrative. Her motivation is clear and consistent, grounded in her heritage and role. While her competence is high, the internal struggle is somewhat muted; the cost she pays is professional maintenance (tending the bloom) rather than a deep personal sacrifice or stark moral reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Situational/Textural lens, moving from the disruption of the caves to a "hammered repose" resolution. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration—establishing a new, fragile equilibrium rather than a binary victory. The logic of the magic system (ice patterns to sound) serves the plot perfectly, ensuring causality remains tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the specific physics of the cave (acoustics) and the environmental manifestation of the beings (ice cracks) dictate Vela's tactical choices. The constraint of finding the specific "intersection of three fracture lines" grounds the magic in the physical reality of the world. Sensory details are vivid and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—the preservation of the caves' sanity—and pressure escalates through the journey to the Deep Resonance. The conflict is resolved through agency and skill, leading to a "bloom of hush." The resolution feels earned, though the cost is primarily the acceptance of a permanent labor ("fragile architecture") rather than an immediate loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation and "hammered repose" is beautifully woven through the action and imagery. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("It was learning to storm together"), which deflates the resonance of the preceding image (recording the new ripple marks). This overt thematic echo reduces the interpretive depth of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly filtered through Vela's perspective as a mapkeeper. The terminology ("ripple-mark," "nodes of cancellation") builds a distinct perceptual signature. The tone remains consistent, modulating effectively between the chaos of the noise and the focused calm of the work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("thrashed like trapped lightning"). A minor artifact appears in the repetition of "gently luminous" to describe both the beings and the stone, but otherwise, the line-level craft is precise and supports the atmospheric weight of the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of an "acoustic ecology" disrupted by energy beings is fresh and well-executed. The synthesis of geology, sound, and ice-reading creates a unique magic system. The solution—creating a chord rather than silence—avoids generic banishment tropes.</comment>
