<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivations are clear and drive the scene effectively; Eleanor’s shift from hostility to curiosity is earned through her interaction with the prop, though the narrator's access to her internal realization slightly blurs the focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from the inciting entry to the resonant closure; the narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, though the weather-timed realization feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The shop is rendered with specific, sensory details ("dust-moted air," "sleeping mouths"), but the storm functions as a generic pathetic fallacy rather than a fresh constraint on the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High emotional stakes are established immediately; the escalation from the legal settlement to the personal artifact effectively forces the protagonist's re-evaluation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of active penance is coherent and moving, though the symbolism of the light and the mechanical heart borders on melodramatic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is generally consistent, but the narrative distance slips during Eleanor's epiphany ("Eleanor saw, truly saw"), and the forced insertion of prompt phrases disrupts the rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("stone dropped into water") and the awkward, repetitive insertion of "aptly deliberate," which creates a visible artifact that breaks the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A professionally executed redemption arc that synthesizes familiar tropes (the prison craftsman, the messenger) into a satisfying, if predictable, package.</comment>
