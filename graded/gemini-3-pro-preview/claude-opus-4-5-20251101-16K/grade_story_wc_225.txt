<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is anchored beautifully by the "productive fidgeting" trait, which organically drives the inciting action. The shift from "exiled tutor" to "solver of stalemates" is earned, though the final internal realization relies slightly on diagnostic language ("forgiving herself for being imperfect") rather than purely embodied release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the causality is tight, with the "stalemate" realization serving as a satisfying pivot point. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the external release mirrors the internal one, though the protagonist's "instinctive" understanding of the spell's mechanics is a minor convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as a constraint and a mirror for the protagonist's internal state; the frozen village is vivid and distinct. The tapestry functions as a brilliant micro-setting that allows the protagonist to manipulate the macro-setting, fulfilling the 9+ criteria for object/setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the pressure builds effectively through the physical toll ("fingers bled") and the passage of time. The recontextualization of the problem from a game to be won to a stalemate to be resolved provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the chess stalemate is excellent, perfectly synthesizing character background with the plot. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("forgiveness was not earned... but chosen"), which reduces the resonance of the otherwise powerful ending image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is managed well, staying close to Mira’s perception while allowing the atmosphere of Stillhaven to breathe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and dense with sensory detail ("woven hush," "shimmered like water"). Phrasing is generally fresh, though there is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("She understood," "She realized") that distances the reader in key moments of discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the "frozen village" and "magical tapestry" are familiar fable tropes, the integration of the chess tutor's perspective—viewing the curse as a stalemate puzzle—adds a specific and fresh layer to the resolution.</comment>
