<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Characterization is distinct, but Mira is largely reactive, serving as a vessel for the statue's wisdom. The final internal shift is summarized with diagnostic labels ("understanding without resolution") rather than dramatized through action, creating a slight distance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The structure is solid, utilizing an effective "in media res" opening that supports the pacing. Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing of the grandmother's legacy, though the physical action of the statue feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, specific sensory details ("anemones flowering in the hollows") that constrain the moment (fogged mask). The underwater atmosphere permeates the narrative logic effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the information escalates well, recontextualizing the grandmother's history. However, the conflict is resolved primarily through the statue's explanation rather than the protagonist's active agency or struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but delivered too explicitly, verging on sermonizing in the final dialogue ("Welcome to the difficulty..."). This didactic approach flattens the subtext, doing the reader's interpretive work for them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and elevated, matching the mythic tone of the setting. The distinct separation between the statue's telepathic voice and the narration is handled well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and atmospheric with high-quality imagery. Rhetorical parallelisms ("Stone should not... yet," "Then... Then...") are effective but verge on repetitive stylization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of the underwater garden with the moral ambiguity of the grandmother is fresh. The execution elevates a common "monster/savior" trope through specific, tactile details.</comment>
