<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct, internally consistent focalizer with a clear, specific worldview. However, her arc is static; she begins and ends in the same state of faithful vigil, observing rather than making difficult choices under pressure. The emotional progression feels more like a label shift than a dramatized transformation of stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building texture through observation and memory to a coherent closure. The orientation is solid, and the ending lands a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the grief. The lack of causal stakes or active obstacles limits the narrative drive to a vignette style.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset, with the cold, the brass, and the light creating a tangible, specific atmosphere. The gondola setting effectively constrains the POV and focuses the narrative. The "emotional topography" concept is grounded well in the physical tools of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pressure is low and static; the conflict is entirely retrospective (grief) or abstract (scientific dismissal) without immediate on-page manifestation. There is no active tightening of options or escalation of risk; the transition from "yearning" to "loved" happens through observation, not agency or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but delivered through explicit statements ("Mira understood...", "She was here to prove...") rather than emergent subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what the clouds mean instead of allowing the meaning to arise solely from the imagery and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone appropriate for the subject. However, it leans into heavy adjectival phrasing that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is marred by the verbatim repetition of unique, complex phrases ("spooled wholeness" and "quietly explosive" each appear twice). This repetition creates a "template" effect that breaks immersion and reads as a lack of editing oversight. Otherwise, the rhythm is generally competent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The central conceit of categorizing clouds by emotion is imaginative and fits the genre well. The execution relies on familiar tropes of the "grief scientist," but the specific imagery of the gondola and the cloud formations adds a fresh layer of specificity.</comment>
