<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira is clearly motivated and her interiority is coherent, anchored well by the bronze foot. However, she lacks contradictory impulses in the scene; she is singular in her purpose, making the emotional arc feel linear rather than dynamic under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The structure is solid with a legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where Mira finds peace. However, the mechanism of her "building" and "stitching" remains vague, and the climax—while emotional—unfolds with a slightly convenient inevitability rather than causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is evocative, effectively blending the industrial decay of the station with the ethereal nature of the calls. The "bronze censer foot" is an excellent, specific micro-setting element that anchors the abstract grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are high emotionally but the narrative pressure is low; the climax faces minimal resistance. The moon phase constraint is established but doesn't actively threaten the connection in the moment, making the success feel guaranteed once the call connects.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but over-articulated; the paragraph defining "Reverse migration" explicitly interprets the story for the reader. The resonance would be stronger if the concept emerged solely through action rather than expository definition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. The dialogue leans slightly toward the poetic/staged ("Like me, wandering") but remains within the bounds of the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric with strong rhythm and imagery ("groaned and froze mid-arc"). Line-level craft is high, though the transition from backstory to the present moment relies on slightly expository phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of a radio operator for the dead is a familiar trope, though the "patchwork navigator" angle adds fresh texture. The execution is competent and moving, but the core narrative creates a standard ghost-story resolution without a radical twist.</comment>
