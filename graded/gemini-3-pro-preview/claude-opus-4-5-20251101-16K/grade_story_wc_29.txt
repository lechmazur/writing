<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation to vindicate her mentor and expose the deception is clear and drives the narrative arc. The shift from "cautiously hopeful" to "grimly" determined provides a solid internal pivot, though the emotional texture is somewhat standard for the genre.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible, but the climax relies on a credibility-straining trope where aliens transmit perfect English text ("CLEVER LITTLE SIGNAL READER"), which feels more cinematic than logical. The closure lands firmly as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "fortress" of the basement with charts "pinned across every wall" grounds the scene effectively in the prompt's tone. However, the setting recedes into the background during the heavy expositional middle section.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "convergence window" creates effective time pressure, and the choice to interfere represents a clear escalation of stakes. The conflict transitions smoothly from a passive interpretation to an active "power play."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic manipulation versus naive hope is coherent and integrated well into the plot. The ending successfully recontextualizes the "game" metaphor, moving from observation to active participation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and effectively filters information through Mira’s expertise. The narrative voice slips into summary ("The problem was, Mira knew...") which slightly dampens the immediacy of the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on scaffold sentences like "Then something unexpected happened," which flattens the climax. Frequent filter verbs ("Mira knew," "Mira had seen") and expositional summary ("Most people thought...") distance the reader from the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the "trickster" concept adds a layer to the First Contact trope, the execution—specifically the antagonists communicating via dramatic text on a screen—feels derivative and lacks a fresh twist.</comment>
