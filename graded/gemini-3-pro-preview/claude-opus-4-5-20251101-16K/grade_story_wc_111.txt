<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is a clearly drawn protagonist with distinct interiority and a consistent voice. The tension between her pragmatic experience and her necessary deception is well-handled, though her "magical" connection to the garden somewhat protects her from the full weight of a purely human dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident and climax are clearly staged. However, the resolution relies heavily on the antagonist effectively surrendering immediately upon witnessing the "miracle," which softens the causal chain; the conflict dissolves rather than forcing a final, difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are excellent, particularly the tactile focus on the cracked marbles and the visual contrast of the "gleaming new meters." The specific interaction between the technology (luck-meters) and the organic setting grounds the speculative element effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes (demolition) are high and the pressure escalates appropriately with the inspector's arrival. While Mara’s confession is a strong moment of agency, the lack of resistance from the inspector—who capitulates almost instantly—lowers the feeling of earned cost at the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, bordering on didactic fable. The protagonist explicitly articulates the thesis in dialogue ("Luck can be measured... But recognition cannot"), which flattens the subtext into a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished, maintaining a lyrical and reflective tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The shift in focus at the very end ("young inspector stood motionless") is slightly jarring but functionally separates Mara from the lesson being taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is distinct and rhythmically controlled ("rebellion recorded in broken glass" is a standout image). The writing is dense and avoids scaffold, though there are moments of telling ("This was the nature of gardens") that explain rather than demonstrate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of "luck-meters" is a fresh and engaging twist on the technology-versus-nature trope. While the execution follows a fairly traditional pattern for this genre, the specific ritual of the marbles adds a layer of genuine ingenuity.</comment>
