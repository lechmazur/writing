<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict is handled through diagnostic labeling ("The combative part... The tender part") rather than embodied struggle. The reveal of her non-human nature resolves the central dilemma via biological destiny rather than character choice, reducing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Causality is clear, moving linearly from the whale's call to the departure. However, the resolution relies on a perspective shift to the workers to deliver the emotional fallout, summarizing the impact rather than dramatizing the protagonist's final threshold crossing with immediate consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "sublittoral fringe" effectively grounds the narrative's liminal themes, and the underwater imagery is consistent. Some descriptors ("murky water," "anchor chains") lean generic, but the setting largely succeeds in mirroring Mira's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the stakes (belonging vs. freedom) are established, the escalation is minimal; the protagonist sheds her human life and obligations with little on-page resistance or hesitation. The immediate dismissal of "obligation" as a "cage" lowers the felt cost of the departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative explicitly states its thesis ("Violence was impossible there because everyone had finally stopped fighting themselves") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. This didactic explanation flattens the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and maintains a mythic tone suitable for the genre. However, the POV shift to the collective workers in the final paragraphs ("The last thing the workers... saw") creates an unearned distance from Mira's subjective closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, but relies on abstract modifiers ("combative," "tender") to carry emotional weight. Metaphors are functional but occasionally heavy-handed ("weighed her down like anchor chains").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story follows a familiar selkie/return-to-origin archetype with standard genre beats. While the conceptual reframe of "internal peace" is interesting, it is delivered through exposition rather than a novel narrative synthesis.</comment>
