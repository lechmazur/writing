<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is a competent, well-defined protagonist whose claustrophobia provides a constant, embodied internal friction against her goal. Her motivation is deeply rooted in legacy and specific grief. The resolution relies slightly on pre-existing knowledge (the letter) rather than an in-moment character pivot or sacrifice, which keeps the character arc functional rather than transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and legible; the "spatial mutiny" mechanic logically complicates the path, and the solution via the organ and compass is satisfyingly set up. Closure lands as a clear Charged Poise (she has the key, the world is changing), though the escape beat feels slightly rushed compared to the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, acting as an antagonist with "walls that migrated" and "silver equations on stone." The spatial distortion is not just flavor but a constraint that shapes Maren’s movement and tactics. The specific imagery (phosphorescent moss, crystallized sound) creates a distinct, cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tension is maintained through the environmental pressure and Maren’s internal phobia. The stakes are clear (survival vs. legacy). However, the resolution of the central conflict is linear—she executes a plan that works exactly as intended—which limits the sense of desperate improvisation or unforeseen cost usually required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of dangerous legacy and "quiet rebellion" is poignant and integrated into the plot mechanics. However, the final paragraphs drift into explanatory summary ("knowledge the ancients had hidden... would wake"), explicating the subtext rather than letting the resonance of the key and the open door speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending architectural precision with atmospheric dread ("prudent calculation," "geometry sings"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Maren’s perception. The tone matches the "explorer/scholar" archetype well, slipping only once or twice into slightly overt labeling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high information density and evocative phrasing ("nexus," "crystallized sound"). There are minor artifacts of awkward phrasing, notably "forcing prudently adventurous calm," where the prompt element is wedged in as a modifier stack. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of "spatial mutiny" and a church stabilized by music is a fresh, specific synthesis of fantasy tropes. While the "find the key to unlock ancient wisdom" structure is traditional, the execution via architectural geometry gives it a distinct, memorable flavor.</comment>
