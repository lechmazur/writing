<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Internal conflict is clear, but characterization relies on explicit labeling ("grim optimist") rather than purely dramatized behavior. The backstory leans on stock phrasing ("success that tasted like ash," "voice breaking") which flattens the emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal arc is solid, moving from calculation to discovery to a Decisive Change at the rupture. Closure is legible with the cost of abandoning immortality/infinity for a finite, textured moment, though the "prison" framing softens the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is established quickly with sensory constraints (marble, cold, step count) that ground the abstract infinite. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices, satisfying the prompt's demand for functional setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (eternity vs. lived experience) and escalation occurs through the protagonist's agency (math proofs). The choice to step through is earned, though the "man vs. environment" conflict is somewhat low-pressure until the final rupture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its theme in the final paragraphs ("This place wasn't a prison. It was a question..."), converting subtext into text. This explanatory wrap-up reduces narrative resonance and triggers the Thematic Echo deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and appropriate for the surreal tone. However, the mandatory insertion of the awkward phrase "balancedly daring" disrupts the prose rhythm, and the narration occasionally over-explains the protagonist's realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent but marred by clichés ("success that tasted like ash," "sourceless light," "wound in fabric"). These stock images dull the unique texture of the "chipped die" and the mathematical focus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "purgatory for regret" trope is executed competently but lacks a fresh conceptual twist. The mathematical angle adds some specificity, but the overall trajectory and the "flashback to the one that got away" feel familiar.</comment>
