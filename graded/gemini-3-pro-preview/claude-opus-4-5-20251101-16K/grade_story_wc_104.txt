<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to shift from fighter to grower is clear and grounds the narrative arc. However, interiority often relies on abstract labels ("presence of possibility," "staggering grace") rather than embodied emotion, and the "scars as jewelry" image feels slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The causal chain of the puzzle is legible, but the solution proceeds too linearly without setbacks to generate tension. The radio announcement serves as a convenient coincidence that resolves the macro-conflict from off-stage, though it successfully pivots the closure focus to preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The contrast between the faded carnival frivolity and the vital seeds is thematically strong and well-supported by props like the velvet-lined piano bench. Orientation is solid, though atmospheric descriptors ("dust motes," "gray light") lean on standard genre tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Immediate pressure is low; the protagonist encounters no active resistance or failure states while solving the puzzle. The tightening relies on the radio message (an external event) rather than an obstacle arising from the scene's action, resulting in a flat exertion curve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central theme of replacing distraction with sustenance is resonant and integrated effectively through the setting and objects. The ending successfully reconfigures the protagonist's identity from destroyer to creator, creating a legible Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately serious, fitting the "solemn liberator" archetype. However, it tends toward high-minded abstraction ("weight of ten thousand futures") that creates a filter between the reader and the immediate physical experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is functional and clear but relies on stock imagery ("dust motes swirling," "echoing against concrete") and standard similes ("cradling it like something sacred"). The density of fresh, specific observation is low, though mechanical control is good.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "seed vault in a dystopia" premise is familiar, and the execution follows standard genre beats without meaningful subversion. The specific mechanism of the piano key code is a distinct detail, but the overall narrative arc feels safe and predictable.</comment>
