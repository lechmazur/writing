<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's agency is strong and her motivation is clear, but her emotional journey is summarized ("felt no fear") rather than embodied in scene. The lack of internal friction or doubt regarding her mortality creates a distance that limits empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeline compression (summarizing six months) dilutes the immediacy of pivotal moments, particularly the climax which is delivered via a diary entry and aftermath. However, the closure is structurally sound and follows the established causal logic perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the "living pillars" and "copper web" are not just background but integral constraints that shape the plot. Sensory details like "faint phosphorescence" and "glinted amber" effectively ground the speculative elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative builds accumulative pressure through the race against time and the transforming orchard, but the lack of active opposition or hard trade-offs limits dramatic tension. The success feels somewhat inevitable as Maren faces no significant setbacks in her work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of interspecies reciprocity is beautifully realized and resonates strongly in the final image of integration. The story avoids abstract moralizing by grounding the thematic resolution in the physical mechanics of the copper rewiring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately meditative, fitting the fable-like structure. However, the reliance on expository telling ("This was the architectural secret") and summary prevents the "show, don't tell" intimacy required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and dense, with excellent rhythm and imagery ("swollen with pressed leaves," "stone pillars... began to breathe"). Information density is high, and there are no significant line-level artifacts or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of botany, architecture, and the bio-mechanical interface of copper wiring creates a fresh premise. The execution transforms the familiar "living stone" trope into something specific and tactile.</comment>
