<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s internal landscape of trauma is vividly drawn and her motivation to protect Lila is clear. However, the child character relies on the "wise-beyond-years" trope, and the attribute "shrewdly innocent" reads as an authorial label rather than an organic trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The climax hinges on a physical impossibility: an eight-year-old writing legible, cramped paragraphs on the friction-bearing *inner* surface of a cast while wearing it is logically unsound. Additionally, the resolution feels unearned; deep PTSD from 15 years of conflict zones is loosened too easily by a single sentimental note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, but the "mist-clad" element is forced into an interior space ("vapor that drifted between potted palms"), creating a confusing environmental logic for a hospital atrium. The sensory details are polished but occasionally sacrifice realism for poetic effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes are established well, but the "Easy Fix" resolution undercuts the gravity of the conflict. The weight of war trauma and inherited anxiety is resolved too neatly by a single moment of connection, lacking a commensurate cost or struggle in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "kintsugi" (healing through brokenness) is coherent but delivered didactically ("naming the inheritance," "graft new meaning"). The resonant reconfiguration is present, but the emotional logic feels slightly prescriptive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controls the timeline of the wait effectively. The transition from memory to the present moment is smooth, though the tone occasionally slips into melodrama ("old bruise spreading").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong information density. However, specific phrases required by the prompt ("lotus-hearted ache," "mist-clad") result in purple patches that clash with the otherwise grounded hospital setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise of a parent healed by a child's innocent wisdom is a familiar sentimental trope. While the specific background (Solomons translator) adds freshness, the execution follows a standard, safe emotional arc.</comment>
