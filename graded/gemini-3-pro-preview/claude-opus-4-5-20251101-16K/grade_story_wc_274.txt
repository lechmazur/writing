<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal state is summarized via diagnostic labeling ("bravely conflicted") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in the moment. While the motivation is rooted in backstory (mother/brother), the reliance on telling rather than showing distances the reader from the visceral cost of the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is effective, moving swiftly from discovery to a decisive closure (Charged Poise) that implies significant future cost. The setup of the "dormant networks" relies on a convenient backstory patch, but the narrative drive holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "hexagonal stacks" and "perpetual chill" create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere that actively isolates the protagonist and heightens the stakes. The sensory details effectively ground the scene, though the repetition of "dizzying quiet" diminishes the immersive effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly defined, pitting personal survival against global truth. The climax involves a distinct, irreversible action, though the "bravely conflicted" label undercuts the tension of the escalation by summarizing the struggle instead of letting it play out.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of buried truth versus sanitized history is coherent and resolves through the protagonist's action. The resonance is slightly dampened by the explicit thematic statement at the end ("spoken the silence aloud") rather than trusting the image to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from unmotivated repetition ("dizzying quiet", "blink that followed surprise") and diagnostic telling. These artifacts disrupt the controlled distance of the third-person perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Notable repetition loops ("dizzying quiet" used twice, "blink that followed surprise" used twice) clutter the short word count and stall momentum. While clarity is maintained, the prose lacks the lexical variety and density required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a lone archivist discovering a government cover-up in a frozen bunker is a well-worn dystopian trope. The execution is competent but follows a standard trajectory without offering a fresh conceptual twist or unique stylistic inflection.</comment>
