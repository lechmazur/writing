<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Maren is consistent and the archivist background is well-integrated, but her emotional peak relies on diagnostic labeling ("Haunted euphoria rose in her") rather than embodied experience. The internal arc is resolved through tidy thematic summary rather than a dramatized struggle or difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orientation and structure are solid, with a clear Accumulative drive toward the signing of the covenant. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (accepting the weight), though the lack of operational friction or complication makes the journey feel somewhat linear and safe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, functioning effectively as a container for the ritual. Specific details like "walnut ink," "sea lavender," and the "weathered planks" ground the abstract themes in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (memory vs. loss) is clear, but the narrative lacks active pressure; the ritual faces no internal doubt or external resistance. The escalation is procedural rather than conflict-driven, resulting in a low-stakes progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit authorial lectures ("Preservation was not about... Maren understood now") rather than subtext. This over-articulation flattens the resonance and leaves little room for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into elevated, writerly diction ("forgetful rhythms") that creates a slight distance from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but marred by abstract emotional labels ("haunted euphoria") and some poetic inflation that softens the imagery. The reliance on summary for the emotional realization reduces the line-level impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The specific trade of the walnut-ink archivist adds a fresh layer to the familiar trope of preserving family history. However, the execution remains within the safe boundaries of a quiet, reflective literary vignette.</comment>
