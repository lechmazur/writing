<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mei is a passive observer who receives her epiphany via dialogue rather than earning it through struggle or choice under pressure. Her motivation is stated in exposition ("searched for the thread") rather than dramatized through friction, and the resolution lacks a character-driven turning point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than a continuous scene, diffusing tension and violating the scope default for this length. The closure is conceptually coherent but arrives without a decisive, high-pressure beat or visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("prayer made stone"), anchoring the piece in a specific mood, though it functions primarily as a backdrop. The environment frames the installation well but does not actively constrain the protagonist's tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; there is no active opposition or distinct tightening of options. The resolution involves no sacrifice or difficult trade-off, merely a shift in perspective prompted by a visitor’s explanation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("The letters weren't about getting someone back..."), violating the subtext requirement. This "Thematic Echo" resolves the narrative's central question with a direct moral statement rather than embodied action or image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the romantic tone, though dialogue often reads as expository prose. The shift from observation to the woman's speech feels functional rather than distinct to a separate character voice, reducing dramatic immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but leans on adverbs ("inevitably whimsical") and repeated descriptors ("prismatic") that feel like prompt-checking. The line-level craft is competent but lacks the density and propulsion of a higher band, relying on summary over scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise of a ghostwriter discovering the true meaning of connection is a familiar trope executed here without a subversive twist or fresh synthesis. While the art installation element offers a slight variation, the emotional arc follows a standard, predictable path.</comment>
