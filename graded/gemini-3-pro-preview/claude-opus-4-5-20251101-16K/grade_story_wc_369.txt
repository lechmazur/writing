<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, grounded presence with a clear competence-based arc. The shift from maintenance worker to gardener is earned through action, though the internal conflict is more intellectual than emotional, lacking the strong contradictory impulses required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The structure follows a clean Accumulative arc, building density through the repair process to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The "pin drop" beat serves as a precise hinge, effectively shifting the lens from mechanical repair to visionary insight with legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the moonlight is a functional constraint that enables Mara's hands to heal so the work can proceed. The spatial contrast between the underground labyrinth and the tower effectively mirrors the thematic shift from inward to outward looking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and the pressure of the storm provides sufficient tightening. The conflict is primarily conceptual; while effective, the story relies on a smooth process of discovery rather than the sharp, difficult trade-offs or high-pressure obstacles of a higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into growth is woven beautifully through the story's mechanics (dust, roots, sextant). The final image of the trees feeding on sorrow offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question without slipping into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and precise, perfectly matching the "quantified sorrow" concept. The shift from the technical language of the sextant to the organic imagery of the roots is controlled and creates a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and evocative ("trailing loss like pollen," "dissected equation"). The pacing is excellent. A slight deduction for the phrase "mundane miracle" in the final movement, which feels generically summarizing compared to the specific freshness of the preceding imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the labyrinth trope with the sextant and the "roots as witnesses" concept feels fresh. The reimagining of the maze dynamic from a prison into a garden provides a satisfying, original conceptual turn.</comment>
