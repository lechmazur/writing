<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal landscape is vivid, and the shift from obsessive linguistic preservation to a deeper emotional purpose feels earned by the accumulation of time. The "methodically hopeful" trait effectively drives her persistence, though the memory of the old woman relies slightly on stock refugee signifiers ("cardboard suitcase," "tears cutting through dust") rather than character-specific detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative structure fits the premise well, building steadily through the context of the last three years to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with the accepted cost of sleeplessness ("She would not sleep tonight either"), though the epiphany is intellectually processed rather than purely dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the nurturing, humid greenhouse and the "smog-choked city" effectively externalizes the theme of preservation against decay. Sensory details like the "pale coin" moon and "tomatoes ripened slowly" create a tactile atmosphere that supports the quiet pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is primarily internal; while the shift in the vision deepens the stakes, the external pressure (skeptical gallery owners) is told in backstory rather than felt in the scene. The "Conceptual Repricing" of her mission is a valid turn, but the immediate pressure on the page is low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The thematic pivot—from saving language to proving kindness—is resonant and clear. However, the story articulates this realization explicitly in thought ("To prove that strangers remember kindness") rather than trusting the subtext of the child-teaching image to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent and supports the dreamlike, insomniac atmosphere without drifting into confusion. The transition from the mundane greenhouse to the memory visions is handled smoothly, maintaining a stable narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, particularly in the greenhouse descriptions ("greenhouse hummed," "cleaning her brush"). However, the refugee description leans on clichés ("cardboard suitcase"), and the "list of similes" for the languages ("like birds," "like rivers") feels slightly formulaic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomnia, a "moon-tipped brush," and lost languages offers a fresh, specific angle on the theme of memory. The move away from a magical translation ability to a purely emotional connection avoids standard fantasy tropes.</comment>
