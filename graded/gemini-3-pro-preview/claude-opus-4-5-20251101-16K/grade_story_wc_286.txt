<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is consistent with the "zen-minded" archetype, though her emotional landscape is somewhat static, relying on calm observation rather than dramatized internal struggle. Her choice to create offerings is character-specific, but the "calm of ten thousand centered pots" reads slightly like label-speak rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to a Conceptual Repricing of the oasis's nature (absorption rather than resistance). The closure is legible and thematically consistent, though the potting sequence feels more like a ritualized enactment of the theme than a high-pressure plot turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "ash-colored earth" contrasting sharply with the "wound healing wrong." The specific mechanics of the oasis—plants reacting to tenderness, the layered timelines visible through the glass—effectively constrain the protagonist's understanding and actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely philosophical ("understanding"), and the pressure is low; Mira is never in true danger or at risk of significant loss. While the "thrum" provides sensory escalation, the conflict is observational, lacking a moment where the protagonist is forced into a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of resilience through absorbing fracture is coherent but articulated with heavy-handed didacticism ("Stronger for their breaking"). The conceptual resonance is somewhat flattened by explicit moralizing in the narrative voice ("A zen-minded potter knows...").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical distance appropriate for the fable-like tone. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She saw," "She found," "She realized") creates unnecessary psychic distance during the discovery beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric but suffers from repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb openers) and filter verbs that dull immediacy. Images like "chimney smoke flattened" are strong, but the "thrum" and "fractures" vocabulary feels slightly generic for the genre.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the potter archetype with time-fractured sci-fi elements is fresh, particularly the concept of vegetation being "phototropic to kindness." The resolution—healing cracks in clay to mirror the timelines—is poetic, if a bit safe.</comment>
