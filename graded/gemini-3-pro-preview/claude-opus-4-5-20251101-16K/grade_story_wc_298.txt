<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is sharply defined by the "reckless idealist" trait, which directly informs the climactic sacrifice. The internal conflict—her potential versus the guilt of her brother's loss—is legible and resolved through a costly choice on the page. The transition from "reckless" to "imperfect and earned" creates a satisfying micro-arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain, and the resolution (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with magical and emotional logic. A minor weakness is the antagonist's exit ("Vesna had fled"), which conveniently clears the stage rather than forcing a final interaction, slightly softening the immediate pressure of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" is a vivid, active setting that participates in the narrative (roots moving, swallowing sarcophagi). The atmosphere is consistent and pressure-filled, with the environment acting as a witness to the transaction. The imagery aligns perfectly with the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central stake is established early and deepens significantly when the initial goal (retrieval) is blocked, forcing a higher-cost alternative (synthesis/sacrifice). The escalation logic holds well under the Causal/Hybrid lens. The disappearance of the antagonist at the critical moment slightly reduces the immediate external tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of interdependence and sacrificing "cleaner, lonelier paths" for shared brokenness is poignantly realized. The resolution doesn't just solve the plot problem; it answers the thematic question about how to mend what is "consumed" by offering a new definition of wholeness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated register that suits the subject matter. The shift from the "reckless" label to the earned "dusky resolve" is handled with consistent interiority. Narrative distance is well-controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("bone shadows into lace," "threading between ribs"). The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though "dusky resolve steady as the turning earth" feels slightly overwritten compared to the sharper imagery elsewhere. No scaffold or loops detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story twists the "deal with the devil" trope by rejecting a zero-sum trade in favor of a transformative synthesis. While the "destiny shop" premise is familiar, the specific resolution—creating a shared future from ash and potential—adds a fresh, humanistic layer.</comment>
