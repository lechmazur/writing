<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya is a capable protagonist with clear motivation, and her shift from observer to witness is earned. However, the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("Fortified vulnerability") to resolve the internal struggle, which distances the reader from the embodied experience of the trauma. The realization about the supervisor's specific intent feels like a leap in logic enabled by the magical download rather than character deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and rising action leading to the confrontation with the lantern. The closure (calling IA with "memories as evidence") is a bold Conceptual Repricing, but the causal link—how subjective supernatural visions function as actionable evidence in a bureaucratic investigation—strains the procedural frame. The "villain reveal" relies on convenient exposition via vision rather than plotted discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the subway tunnel and the crawlspace are rendered with sensory precision that grounds the supernatural elements. The lantern functions effectively as a micro-setting that constrains attention and triggers the plot. The atmosphere balances the sterility of the investigation with the weight of history seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high, blending physical survival with the integrity of history and justice. The escalation works well as the threat shifts from physical (tunnel safety) to psychic (memory possession). The cost—agreeing to carry the weight of these traumatic memories forever—is a legitimate felt price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "preventable" deaths expands beautifully to cover historical negligence and systemic erasure. The connection between the Underground Railroad and modern worker safety is resonant without being preachy. The only slip is the explicit labeling of the theme via the therapist's term, which tells rather than trusts the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, professional yet capable of emotional depth. The transition into the vision is handled with distinct perceptual shifts ("her own hands but not her hands"). The narrative distance controls the supernatural elements well, keeping them grounded in Maya's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, rhythmic, and clear. However, the insertion of therapy-speak ("Fortified vulnerability") during the high-pressure climax is a text artifact that breaks immersion. Otherwise, the line-level work is dense and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a supernatural ghost story with a bureaucratic safety investigation is fresh and engaging. Using the lantern as a literal and metaphorical bridge works well. The "evidence" angle at the end adds a unique, if slightly implausible, twist to the genre.</comment>
