<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct mythic figure, but she functions more as a vessel for the theme than a character making hard choices under pressure. Her motivation is asserted via narration ("She could not sleep because...") rather than demonstrated through resistance or contradictory impulses in a dramatized moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Across centuries") and montage ("A child... A soldier...") rather than a unified scene, which violates the scope default and diffuses dramatic tension. The closure—a cognitive reframe—is stated rather than earned through a causal sequence of on-page actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the "gargantuan shell" and "bioluminescent gardens" are vivid and effectively set the tone. The setting acts as a constraint on the sound, which integrates well with the plot, though some descriptions lean toward standard post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is resolved through the passive passage of time and off-page influence rather than a specific, high-pressure turning point faced by the protagonist. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where Mira is forced to trade one value for another in the present tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thematic statements ("This was her gift: to photosynthesize pain...") and a sermonizing list of lessons at the end ("pain metabolized can become medicine"). This didactic approach crowds out subtext and earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent and confident, suiting the fable-like structure. However, the narrative distance is often too great, summarizing emotional states ("The reef-shadow joy she felt") rather than allowing the reader to experience them through the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose has a pleasing rhythm but suffers from overwriting and explanatory scaffolding ("That was the nature of her particular wound"). The reliance on "to [verb]" constructions to explain motivation weakens the line-level momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of a healing singer in a drowned world is executed competently but treads familiar ground. The synthesis of elements feels organic, though the "healing fable" tone prevents a fresher, riskier take on the premise.</comment>
