<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct vessel for the story's philosophy, but she lacks internal friction; her responses ("not the crying kind") rely on familiar stoic tropes rather than specific, embodied character work. While her competence is established, the lack of contradictory impulses or a moment where she almost turns away renders the characterization static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean example of a Situational drive, moving from construction to a "Charged Poise" closure that reframes the silence as an answer. The "false hope" beat with the sunlight provides necessary structure, though the pacing drags slightly in the expository middle section.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "green-filtered light" and the vertical geography of the grotto are vivid and constrain the action effectively. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the "transient" theme, grounding the esoteric elements in physical detail like birch twigs and spider silk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are thematic and high-concept (extinction) but lack immediate, on-page pressure for Mira herself; she is never at risk of failing the build or missing the moment. The conflict remains internal and contemplative, lacking a sharp escalation that forces a trade-off or costly choice beyond the act of witnessing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "absence as presence" is handled with sophistication, and the ending resonates powerfully with the premise of the "interrupted cadence." The story successfully avoids a tidy moral, allowing the grief of the empty sky to stand as its own resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally slips into "tell" mode ("She was what the old texts called...") rather than letting the worldview emerge through action. The tone matches the "esoteric realist" label well, maintaining a steady, melancholic dignity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("map written in their blood," "prayer made visible"), and the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("transiently rooted," "blushing stillness") feels mechanical rather than rhythmic. The pathetic fallacy regarding the grotto's "embarrassment" is a strong choice that may not land for all readers but fits the POV.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a ritualist for extinct species in a floating sky-island is compelling and blends genres effectively (solarpunk/fantasy). The execution is competent but stays within a safe, quiet mode that avoids riskier narrative choices or sharper subversions of the "mourning watcher" trope.</comment>
