<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, consistent protagonist, and her "gentle persistence" is well-dramatized in the bell ritual. However, her internal landscape feels smoothed over by summary; the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands are replaced by a settled, retrospective wisdom that lowers active tension. The extensive expository backstory ("She was not supposed to be a leader...") delays the present-moment anchor, establishing her traits via resume rather than immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative structure is coherent, and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands with a legible decision to endure rather than declare. However, the scene relies heavily on a front-loaded block of exposition to set the stakes, delaying the "inciting incident" of the midnight run. The resolution comes through dialogue that restates a pre-existing philosophy rather than a tactic forged in the heat of the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "bruised purple" valley and the "amplified quiet" effectively establish a somber, secretive mood. The setting constraints (darkness, the rocky path) functionally support the plot's logic of invisibility. The specific "terra-cotta arbor" creates a distinct anchor, though some surrounding descriptions ("shadows," "moonlight") lean toward generic imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (survival vs. pride/recognition) is clear, and Bekir's challenge provides necessary escalation. Yet the conflict is resolved too smoothly; the opposition yields immediately to Mira’s speech, lacking the visceral "push-back" or near-failure that characterizes high-band tension. The cost of "invisibility" is stated ("exhausting") but felt less acutely than the relief of the ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of dignity in exile is resonant and handled with maturity, avoiding simple solutions. The bell serves as a strong, non-literal subtextual anchor for the community's endurance. However, the dialogue tends to explicate the theme ("First, we become unbreakable") rather than letting the subtext carry the weight of the argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally controlled and distinct, fitting the gentle tone of the protagonist. However, a POV slip occurs when the narrator accesses Bekir’s internal reasoning ("He had seen enough history to recognize what she was doing") to validate Mira, breaking the established limitation. This "helpful narrator" intrusion distances the reader from the scene's immediate reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong cadence in the final paragraph. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("Mira suspected," "Mira understood") that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The triad "their parliament, their church, their heart" feels slightly overwritten and clichéd, but overall line-level control is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of maintaining dignity through secret anonymity offers a nuanced take on the exile narrative. While the specific mechanism of the bell and food runs is engaging, the execution follows a fairly standard "wise elder refrains from rash action" template. The emotional beat is effective but safe.</comment>
