<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s defining trait ("devotedly observant") acts as an asserted label rather than an embodied characteristic, directly contradicted by her fifteen-year blindness to the evidence she held. The emotional shift is functional but relies on this convenient, label-driven epiphany rather than earned character work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The central mechanism—a nib replaced by an unknown party (presumably the killer or coroner) who inexplicably left the incriminating scroll inside—strains plausibility. The causality relies on convenient timing and prop logic that dissolves under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory setting is utilized effectively, providing atmospheric grounding and a thematic counterweight to the "ink" of the investigation. Sensory details like the "sharpest stars" and "clouds spreading beneath" charge the scene well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the stakes are high, the resolution comes too easily through the discovery of the scroll, lacking on-page resistance or active antagonism. The dramatic pressure is low because the obstacle is removed by a lucky find rather than a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "stars vs. ink" duality provides a coherent thematic spine that links the setting to the internal conflict effectively. The "orbits of regret" metaphor frames the arc well, though its explicit reiteration borders on being too on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the "heiress astronomer" persona with appropriate elevation. The final tonal shift to "solemn playfulness" is abrupt but signaled clearly enough to land.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished, but the forced repetition of the prompt phrase "devotedly observant" creates a visible loop artifact. The "proof by contradiction" section relies heavily on summary telling rather than dramatized deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise fuses a standard mystery trope (hidden scroll in a prop) with a distinct setting, but the execution remains conventional. The "proof by contradiction" framing offers a mild spark of ingenuity within a familiar structure.</comment>
