<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira is a distinct, motivated protagonist with grounded interiority. The interaction with her future self drifts into therapeutic validation ("voice carrying that particular icy warmth"), softening the struggle, but her acceptance of "adjacency" creates a coherent emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure is solid, utilizing the twilight window effectively as a constraint. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly, though the climax relies on a conversation that resolves tension verbally rather than through a costly action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "mechanically warm" walls and the "hush of beating wings" effectively ground the high-concept sci-fi elements in tactile reality. The environment actively constrains the timeline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The external pressure (moths waking) creates a functional ticking clock, but the internal conflict resolves somewhat easily through the vision. The stakes remain largely theoretical until the final acceptance, which earns the stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of non-linear time is central but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("Time doesn't separate us"), bordering on a thematic echo that explains the story's thesis rather than letting it resonate through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and meditative, suiting the character's isolation. The voice slips slightly into diagnostic labeling during the epiphany ("This was what subdued awakenings felt like"), but generally holds control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic. Minor deductions for "holographic principles" acting as a vague handwave and the slightly oxymoronic "icy warmth," though the latter was a required element. The "mechanically warm" repetition works well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of "time as spatial adjacency" is a familiar sci-fi trope, but the specific angle of the unrecognized mechanic gives it a fresh, grounded texture. The execution elevates a standard premise.</comment>
