<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Miriam is distinct as a carver, but her agency is significantly undermined by the spectral grandmother who provides both the diagnosis ("thinking too small") and the solution ("retrace"). The protagonist follows instructions rather than driving the discovery through struggle, resulting in a linear emotional arc with little internal resistance or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation and structure are solid, with a clear timeline and legible progression. However, the narrative relies on a low-friction sequence where external guidance resolves the central problem, reducing the causal density. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the resolution limits its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospherically rich, effectively grounding the spectral elements. The specific imagery of the monarchs and the "woven ribbon roll" tool integrates well with the final design concept, demonstrating strong sensory command.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The external stakes (memorial commission) are established, but the conflict lacks genuine pressure or opposition. The "struggle" to find the design is resolved quickly by the mentor figure's interventions, removing the necessity for the protagonist to make difficult trade-offs or face failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The themes of collective grief, inheritance, and migration cohere beautifully. The spiral design serves as a strong summarizing symbol. While the execution is slightly didactic—explicitly stating the lesson at the end—the thematic unity is high.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, matching the protagonist's mindset. There are moments of abstract phrasing ("spectral mentorship delivered through the quiet language of presence") that distance the reader, but the overall control is steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("thundering calm," "grief-sharp edge"). Sentence structures in the middle section rely somewhat repetitively on "Miriam [verb]" openings, creating a slight scaffold cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The specific profession of gravestone carving and the spiral memorial design are fresh and inventive. However, the "grandmother ghost providing life advice" trope is conventional and handled without a subversive or complicating twist, limiting the story's ingenuity.</comment>
