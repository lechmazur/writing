<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, but her pivotal decision to remain in danger relies on the abstract label "Legacy's burden" rather than a visceral, on-page struggle. The internal conflict is summarized ("She should have run") rather than dramatized, making the fatal choice feel slightly mechanical. Her reaction to the supernatural threat lacks embodied physiological urgency until the very end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving efficiently from exploration to entrapment with a clear Causal link between Mira's curiosity and her fate. However, the "half-burned diaries" in a recently lit fireplace within a 30-year ruin function as a convenient, magical exposition dump rather than an earned discovery. Closure is strong, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist is subsumed by the setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is active and atmospheric, effectively transitioning from a passive environment to an antagonist that physically constrains the character. Specific details like "geometric precision softened by relentless green life" ground the sci-fi concept in tangible imagery. The "vibrations" and acoustic focus provide a distinct sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation is well-paced, rising from professional observation to existential threat through the discovery of the logs and the negative. The protagonist's agency—choosing to ask "What do you dream about?"—directly triggers the climax, satisfying the requirement for earned consequences. The cost is total and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory and abandonment is tightly woven into the horror elements, offering a fresh take on the "haunted house" via the acoustic cartography concept. The ending resonates deeply with the premise, recontextualizing the walls' "dreams" as a terrifying loneliness. Subtext regarding the weight of inheritance is present, though explicitly stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and melancholic, suiting the atmospheric nature of the piece. However, the POV occasionally drifts into summary to expedite information ("The motivation was singular, strange"), creating distance during what should be intimate moments of discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is functional but relies on summary bridges ("pieced together what had driven the old woman") that reduce immediacy. Some phrasing is clunky, particularly the prompt-mandated "sensitively perceptive," which reads as a tell-y label. Passive constructions ("The motivation was...") occasionally stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a "corridor echo cartographer" is highly original and imaginatively synthesized with eco-horror elements. While the "found diary" trope is standard, the specific execution involving acoustic memories and walls that dream of wholeness feels fresh and distinct.</comment>
