<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is a sympathetic focalizer with a clear internal lack, and the arc from brokenness to acceptance is legible. However, the key trait "innocently cunning" appears as a diagnostic label in interiority rather than being dramatized through a high-stakes tactical choice, and the epiphany relies on summarized realization ("slow unfurling") rather than a decisive action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the causal chain—seeking a cure, being tested, finding a new perspective—is logically sound. Closure is achieved through Conceptual Repricing (re-evaluating her flaw as a gift), though the lack of an externalized cost (she keeps the currency) softens the dramatic impact of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sensory details of the glass and light, filtered specifically through the protagonist's colorblind perspective (muddy browns, dull ochres vs. light form), are excellent. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's realization, fulfilling the criteria for high-band setting work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The internal conflict is well-defined, but the external pressure is relatively low; the interaction with Vera is gentle and instructional rather than fraught with risk. The stakes are personal and artistic, lacking a sharp, irreversible consequence on the page beyond the opportunity cost of the journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is resonant and effectively mirrored in the glass rejects and the final plant arrangement. The symbolism of the "cracked pot" is slightly didactic, but the integration of the protagonist's specific visual limitations gives the theme a fresh, grounded texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent fable-like quality that suits the material. The POV is strictly anchored in Mira’s perception, effectively using her visual limitations to color the narrative description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with imagery ("trailing fire," "fractured through imperfect curves"). A few instances of telling via abstract nouns ("perceived truth," "accidental harmonies") and the clunky insertion of the "innocently cunning" label prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the phoenix-glass concept with colorblindness offers a distinct aesthetic angle on a classic self-acceptance fable. While the "cure was within you" trope is familiar, the specific execution through light and glass sculpture adds sufficient freshness.</comment>
