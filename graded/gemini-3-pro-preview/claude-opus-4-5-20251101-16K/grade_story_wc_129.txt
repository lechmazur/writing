<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Veris is a strongly defined focalizer with clear motivation ("graft herself"), but her integration into the community feels slightly idealized. She functions as a therapeutic presence whose "fierce sympathy" resolves the others' griefs with high competence, lacking significant internal flaws or missteps that would heighten character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story effectively uses a two-shard structure (meeting Kael, then the anniversary), but the "Months passed" summary bridge dilutes the narrative tension. The central conflict of belonging is largely resolved in this summary montage, leaving the final scene as a ceremonial confirmation rather than a high-stakes dramatic turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral; the "crystalline orchard" and "obsidian arbor" are not just backdrops but sources for the protagonist’s art and the community's ritual. The environment meaningfully constrains the search and shapes the final sculpture, satisfying the integration requirement well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (belonging) is established early, but the opposition (the community's distance) crumbles during the summary section rather than in a pressurized scene. The climax functions as a celebration of a victory already achieved off-page, lacking active resistance or a costly on-page trade-off to drive the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of "finding each other in the search" is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness in the final paragraphs ("Veris understood at last that belonging was..."). This diagnostic thematic statement replaces implicit resonance with a moralizing summary, triggering the deduction for explicit theme-stating at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the atmospheric setting. The POV remains firmly with Veris, and the tone modulates effectively between the quiet grief of the orchard and the "fierce" sympathy of the protagonist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("fractured it into whispers of color"). Minor deductions for occasional filtering ("Veris wanted," "Veris understood") and a tendency toward sentimental polysyndeton in the final lines ("luminescent and beautiful and endless").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a community built around a futile search for a "Cartographer" is imaginative and fresh. However, the narrative arc of the "outsider healing a community through art" is a familiar trope, and the execution follows a relatively safe, linear path without major structural or perspective risks.</comment>
