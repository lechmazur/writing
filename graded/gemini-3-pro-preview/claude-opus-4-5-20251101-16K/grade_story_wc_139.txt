<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elena's internal conflict—honesty versus her father's criminal legacy—is well-dramatized, fueling the central choice. The shift in her moral calculus ("fair trade") feels earned by her backstory, though the moment where her thinking "liquefied" relies slightly on internal summary rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving from a static wait to a decisive act of forgery that irrevocably alters Elena's stance. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with the felt cost of breaching her own ethical sanctuary, and the causal chain holds firmly under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is rendered with visceral, sensory specificity ("refrigerated silence," "unyielding flesh") that contrasts effectively with the vitality of the ink. The vintage ink pot acts as a crucial micro-setting/tool that constrains the method and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high: legal safety versus a life saved. The pressure escalates naturally from Miriam's arrival to the specific demand for proof of execution, forcing Elena to abandon her passive "waiting" for active intervention with visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "truth vs. facts" is resonant, but the execution leans toward the explicit side in the final paragraphs ("truth that needed lies to be believed"). The ending summarizes the thematic argument rather than letting the image of the ink/blood carry the full weight of the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and professional, blending the clinical detachment of a mortician with the simmering tension of the illegal act. The POV remains tightly anchored in Elena's perception without leakage, maintaining consistent distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high density and evocative imagery ("scattered his network like ashes"). Minor deduction for a few scaffold phrases ("The irony wasn't lost on her") and a slightly melodramatic final simile, but the rhythm and clarity are publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mortuary setting with a forgery thriller premise offers a fresh, specific angle on the "sanctuary" trope. The transformation of the father's criminal tool into an instrument of humanitarian aid adds a layer of genuine ingenuity.</comment>
