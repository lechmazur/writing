<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marta is a superbly realized focalizer; her internal landscape is specific, blending the technical legacy of the lockmaster with her own "light gardening" in a way that feels distinct and lived-in. The "ache of loving fragile things" provides a grounded emotional cost to her ritual, earning the stasis at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, where the ritual of the mirrors creates a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's identity from lockmaster's daughter to keeper of light. Closure lands effectively with the "earned stasis" of persisting through winter, anchored by the cost of the dying rose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific geometry of the fire escape, the "path of the moon," and the positioning of mirrors constrain the character's actions and drive the narrative. The sensory details—from the "creak of boats" to the "mismatched pots"—create a vivid, tactical atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conflict is internal and atmospheric, pitting Marta's determination against the encroaching winter and darkness; while the external pressure is passive (entropy), the internal stakes are high and clearly articulated. The pressure coheres beautifully under the accumulative lens, forcing the crystallization of her role as "keeper."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming a legacy of "keeping people out" (locks) into "letting light in" is handled with exceptional grace and lack of didacticism. The subtext of the bitting gauge—a tool for barriers used here for openings—resonates powerfully without needing overt explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and closely aligned with Marta's wistful pragmatism, maintaining a consistent psychic distance throughout. The transition between the technical details of the lock tools and the poetic observation of the harbor is seamless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("wake catching moonlight in a V-shaped trail"); however, the verbatim repetition of the unique phrase "wistfully pragmatic" (in paragraphs 2 and 8) creates a noticeable echo that momentarily breaks the immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central conceit of a "fire escape light gardener" using mirrors to illuminate neighbors' lives is a fresh, specific synthesis of setting and character. The recontextualization of the lockmaster's trade into a metaphor for light/hope feels original and inevitable.</comment>
