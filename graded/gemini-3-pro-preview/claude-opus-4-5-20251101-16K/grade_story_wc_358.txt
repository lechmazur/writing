<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, focused professional whose motivation is clearly dramatized. The internal pivot from seeking truth to accepting the limits of foresight adds depth, though her interiority remains strictly functional and lacks deeper personal specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A significant causality break undermines the climax: the text establishes the port was "rearranged" and currents "no longer quite existed," yet Mira physically feels the fatal "singular convergence" wind funnel at the top of the stack. The closure is conceptually strong but rests on this contradictory logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "towering labyrinth" and wind-as-character create a vivid, palpable atmosphere that actively pressures the protagonist. However, the spatial logic regarding the port's rearrangement muddies the physical reality of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works well on the surface, moving from a survey to a dangerous climb that mirrors the victim's fate. The shift from a negligence narrative to a systemic "physics" explanation effectively reweights the stakes, though the logic flaw softens the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of systemic optimization versus individual safety is integrated well through the "roaring metabolism" subtext. The contrast between aviation precision (the patch) and shipping chaos resonates without feeling forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending technical observation with atmospheric dread. However, repetitive sentence structures ("She held," "She walked," "She crouched") flatten the narrative rhythm and distance the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery is precise and evocative ("diesel fumes," "flushing pink," "invisible rivers"). The score is capped by a pervasive template cadence in sentence openers (Subject-Verb repetition) that creates a monotonic effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of mapping wind in a container port is a fresh, specific angle on the procedural genre. The execution is solid, though the logical inconsistency in the premise prevents it from feeling fully ingenious.</comment>
