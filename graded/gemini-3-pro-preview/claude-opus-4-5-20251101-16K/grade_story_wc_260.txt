<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict is lucid, and her motivation to heal is well-established. However, the emotional processing is structured as a schematic list ("First... Second... Third..."), which intellectualizes the grief rather than dramatizing the messy, contradictory experience of betrayal. The resolution feels slightly therapeutic and tidy given the magnitude of the breach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and grounding. The narrative arc moves clearly from paralysis to a concrete decision (calling the commission) and a symbolic ritual (storing the tail), creating effective Resonant Reconfiguration. The linear structure serves the short length well, though the "shedding layers" segment feels more expository than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop atmosphere is tangible, blending the mechanical (filtration systems, heat lamps) with the organic effectively. The setting details—specifically the terrarium wall and the specific animals—ground the introspection in a believable physical reality, though some descriptors ("silver witness of stars") lean toward the purple.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (professional integrity vs. personal affection), and the internal pressure is coherent. The escalation is somewhat muted by the analytical style of the "shedding" sequence, which resolves the tension through rational sorting rather than a high-pressure on-page struggle. The final decision feels earned but perhaps reached too smoothly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of healing and adaptation is coherent but delivered heavily through explicit parallels (the chameleon shedding vs. Mira shedding). The direct labeling of the emotional layers ("First, the denial") reduces subtext, turning the thematic progression into a stated thesis rather than an emergent property of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, gentle, and reflective, suiting the character. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally drifts into a slightly elevated, writerly register ("fragile as hollow bone") that feels more like authorial intrusion than the character's immediate thought process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose has a pleasing rhythm and vivid imagery ("curved like a question mark"). However, it relies on several clichés ("held its breath," "silver witness") and the list structure ("First... Second...") creates a rhetorical scaffold that slows momentum. The density is good, but the sentimentality at the closure softens the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a wildlife rehab smuggler is a strong, specific hook. However, the central metaphor—shedding skin as a symbol for personal growth—is a familiar trope. The execution is competent, but the core "healing through nature" arc follows a standard literary template without a sharp, unexpected subversion.</comment>
