<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amira’s internal conflict is embodied with visceral specificity; the distinction she draws between "recovery" and "navigation" creates a nuanced, resilient character stance. The somatic reactions (locking muscles, narrowing vision) effectively ground the backstory in present-tense physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear situational arc from voluntary trigger (looking at the photo) to regulation and return. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis, where the return to the seedlings resonates as a decisive recommitment to life without erasing the grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff edge provide strong sensory grounding ("salt wind," "coolness seep into her skin"). However, the lighthouse metaphor—contrasting mechanical efficiency with human tenderness—feels slightly heavy-handed and over-determined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but high; Amira's choice to voluntarily engage the trigger (the photograph) creates active escalation rather than passive suffering. The cost is palpable in the physical description of the "freeze," satisfying the requirement for on-page consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thematic summary ("To anchor optimism in realism—that was the work now") is too explicit, converting subtext into a thesis statement. This telling flattens the resonance of the final image, which could have carried that meaning implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The POV is intimate and controlled, successfully balancing clinical terminology ("somatic markers") with lyrical observation. The shift from the traumatic memory back to the immediate sensory present is handled with smooth narrative distance management.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and polished, but relies on some familiar phrasing ("reliable as the tides," "pearl of stillness") that softens the impact. The "gray snow" image is a strong, specific highlight that demonstrates the quality the piece aims for.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery and gardening is handled with dignity and competence, though the central metaphors and the drone-strike backstory are familiar literary territory. The somatic focus adds a fresh, specific layer to the healing narrative.</comment>
