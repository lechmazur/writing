<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, but her "curiosity" is established through summary rather than action ("persistently curious by nature"). The emotional stakes for her are told rather than shown through a personal cost or specific dilemma beyond the immediate professional duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc, but the "predatory signal" functions as a deus ex machina antagonist—appearing abruptly to force a climax without prior setup. The closure is solid (Resonant Reconfiguration), effectively tying the hearing aid motif to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The acoustic atmosphere is well-rendered, with specific sensory details regarding static and frequencies ("whispered in static"). However, visual descriptors like "mist-clad" and "reeling hush" lean toward atmospheric clichés that distance the reader.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The conflict relies on an external "predatory frequency" that is introduced and resolved within two paragraphs, lacking the weight of established stakes. The cost of the "heroism" is transient (trembling hands), making the victory feel unearned despite the thematic fit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of connection through technology is handled well, with the hearing aid serving as a potent symbol of listening across boundaries. The ending resonates emotionally, though the explicit labeling of the theme ("Incidental heroism, they called it later") weakens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, but the retrospective intrusion ("Incidental heroism, they called it later") breaks the immediate immersion of the climax. The voice is generally competent but occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally overwritten ("twilight surrendered to night," "thickened to opacity"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Mira felt," "Mira saw") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" using a vintage hearing aid is a fresh, specific hook. However, the execution falls into standard séance tropes with vague "predatory" entities, limiting the story's ingenuity.</comment>
