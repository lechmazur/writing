<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct, professional presence whose internal conflict—balancing the hunger of the dead against the fragility of the living—drives the narrative. Her choice to abandon the "social" justice of exposing the father in favor of the "archival" justice of the ice is a specific, character-defining decision with ethical weight. The interaction with Elsa demonstrates her trait of weaving truth carefully, showing competence and compassion without sliding into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is flawless, moving from the inciting artifact to a clear investigation recap and a poignant, decisive resolution. The closure (carving the truth into ice) serves as a Conceptual Repricing of justice: acknowledging that while the living are unreachable, the record can still be corrected. The causal logic of the dream-investigation supports the emotional climax perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just atmospheric but structural; the glacier's permanence provides the solution to the protagonist's dilemma. Details like the "blue ice holding centuries of silence" and the "melted snow globe" integrate tightly with the theme of preservation. The physical environment constrains the ghost (the fissure) and enables the resolution (the carving).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and felt: the salvation of a child's memory against the weight of a father's grief. While the external conflict is quiet (a conversation with a ghost), the internal pressure on Mira to find a meaningful resolution is strong. The turn—renouncing the attempt to convince the living—is a satisfying escalation that accepts a difficult reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "borrowed light" and the endurance of truth in ice versus the transient memory of people resonates powerfully. The story avoids a tidy moral about "the truth setting you free" in a social sense, opting for a deeper, more melancholic truth about preservation. The final image of carving weaves the plot and theme into a singular, lasting action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, professional, and tinged with a specific melancholic lyricism that fits the glacial setting ("intertwined like rope fibers," "growing teeth"). The perspective remains tightly anchored in Mira’s expertise. Dialogue between Mira and Elsa manages to be expository without feeling wooden, carrying the emotional weight of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("warped dome," "calcification of guilt"). The "borrowed light/starlight" motif is used purposefully to charge the ending. Sentence rhythm varies well, maintaining momentum through the exposition of the dream-method and slowing appropriately for the emotional release at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of wreck-diving and ghost-whispering creates a fresh professional lens. The resolution subverts the standard "ghost wants justice" trope by redefining justice as an act of private preservation rather than public vindication. It feels specific and earned.</comment>
