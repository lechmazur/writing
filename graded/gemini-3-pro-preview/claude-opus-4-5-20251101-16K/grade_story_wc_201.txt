<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is exceptionally concrete and character-specific; the "pain as geometry" motif successfully frames embodied emotion through the protagonist's enhanced physiology. The arc from analytical detachment to emotional release is earned by the on-page accumulation of data points, with the final renunciation of the "mission" feeling inevitable and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts into a potent Conceptual Repricing at closure; the "data collection" structure justifies the pacing and leads naturally to the realization. Closure lands with a clear redefinition of the premise (penance for survival, not sin) and a tangible physical action (leaving the strap).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The proprioceptive enhancement functions brilliantly as a micro-setting, constraining how the protagonist navigates the macro-setting (the UV forest) and filtering all description through a specific biological lens. The interplay between internal muscular coordinates and external light frequencies creates a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that charges the final beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and escalates effectively through the deepening of memory, moving from physical discomfort to the core emotional wound. While the external environment is somewhat passive, the internal stakes are high and the protagonist’s agency in triggering the worst memory drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central question ("mathematics of mercy") is rigorously tested and deconstructed through specific, dramatized examples rather than abstract exposition. The ending offers a resonant answer—mercy as an irrepressible human glitch—that reweights the story’s tragic elements without dissolving into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature, blending clinical/tactical terminology with raw trauma ("temporal artery," "coordinates of agony"). The control of psychic distance is precise, allowing the analytical shield to crack exactly at the moment of emotional realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density in every sentence; the extended metaphor of geometry/coordinates is handled with discipline and never clutters the pacing. Tactile details like the "pewter loops" and "ozone" anchor the more abstract sci-fi elements firmly in the physical world.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of proprioceptive enhancement, a UV-reactive forest, and the "mathematics of mercy" premise creates a genuinely fresh angle on the interrogation/trauma trope. The execution transforms familiar sci-fi elements into a unique, emotionally specific study of guilt and survival.</comment>
