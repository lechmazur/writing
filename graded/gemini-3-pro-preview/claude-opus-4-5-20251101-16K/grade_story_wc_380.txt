<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is poignant and deeply anchored in the backstory of her mother’s memory loss, driving her actions with emotional clarity. Her interiority is embodied, though the "forgetting" concept verges on exposition in the middle; her final choice to bear the weight of the memories earns the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure lands with emotional weight. However, the coffee grounds spelling out "Exhume" acts as a convenient mechanism that bypasses investigative struggle, slightly softening the causal chain of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific physics of the salt chamber (gravity pockets) constrain Mira's movement and thematically mirror the weight of memory. The atmosphere is vivid and sustains the magical realism tone perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and personal, escalating from the environmental anomaly to the specific recovery of the mother's journal. The ending establishes a felt cost—the burden of remembering for someone who cannot—which satisfies the requirement for meaningful closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory having physical weight is resonant and well-executed. While the epiphany paragraph ("Mira understood now...") is somewhat explanatory, the final image of reading to the forgetting mother powerfully anchors the abstract concept in human action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Mira’s perception of the changing world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative, but the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("fluctuated mysteriously," "gleaming silence") creates noticeable text loops that feel mechanical rather than rhythmic. The adverbial phrasing "fluctuated mysteriously" is weak telling that dulls the description both times it appears.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of beached whales, gravity anomalies, and crystallized memory is distinct and imaginative. The concept transforms the "memory storehouse" trope into something physically grounded and fresh.</comment>
