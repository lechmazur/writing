<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira functions primarily as a passive receiver of the diary's wisdom rather than an active agent forcing the turn; her "inquisitive" nature is asserted but does not drive a choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The floor-by-floor structure provides clear accumulation, but the plot relies on the convenient convergence of the goggles, invisible ink, and specific lighting conditions without prior setup to earn the payout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the mechanics of the story; the specific interplay of the ice-crusted shaft and refracted light actively constrains and enables the central discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is internal and low-pressure; the protagonist faces no external opposition or difficult trade-offs, leading to a resolution that feels gifted by the diary rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story relies on a Thematic Echo where the diary explicitly states the thesis ("joy that lives beneath anguish"), which the final paragraph then summarizes, replacing subtext with moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent, though it leans into sentimentality that mirrors the diary's tone, blurring the distinction between the captain's voice and Mira's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and sensory ("prismatic ribbons," "unfold like wings"), though the emotional beats often rely on abstract summary rather than concrete, grounded action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of decoding a journal via environmental light is clever, but the "wisdom from the grave" narrative plays out predictably without a subversive twist or deeper complication.</comment>
