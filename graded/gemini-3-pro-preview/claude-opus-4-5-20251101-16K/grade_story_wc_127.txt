<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation ("fuse insight with empathy") is delivered via diagnostic summary rather than dramatized struggle, flattening the arc. The emotional climax relies on abstract labels ("Real joy hurt. Real grief sang") rather than specific, embodied sensation, distancing the reader from the protagonist's physical experience of the "vessel" state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent with a legible Decisive Change at closure where Vera abandons her trade for authenticity. The mechanics of the "transformation" feel slightly convenient, arriving precisely on cue without sufficient on-page friction, but the causal chain holds the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "amber grotto" and "fragrance chemist's blotter" provide vivid, tactile grounding that effectively creates a unique atmosphere. Sensory details like "honey and shadow" and "static discharge" successfully bridge the physical setting with the story's metaphysical concepts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but the conflict remains largely internal; the client, Felix, is a passive receptacle who exerts little pressure on Vera's choice. The cost of her decision—the loss of professional safety—is understood conceptually but the immediate, felt price is dampened by the swift resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of authentic suffering versus comfortable falsehood is well-integrated and resolves resonantly in the final image. Dialogue occasionally drifts into on-the-nose thematic statement ("I didn't promise it would be fake"), but the core concept remains robust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice successfully balances clinical terminology ("emotional signature") with lyrical description. However, authorial intrusion explains motivation directly ("Her motivation had never been profit"), momentarily breaking the immersive POV to summarize backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric, though it leans on parallel structures ("Real joy hurt. Real grief sang") and abstract telling at peak moments. The rhythm is controlled, but the brevity limits the textural depth required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of trading emotions is a familiar trope, but the specific aesthetic of the "amber grotto" and the "blotter petal" adds a distinctive flavor. The execution is competent, offering a solid if not groundbreaking variation on the genre.</comment>
