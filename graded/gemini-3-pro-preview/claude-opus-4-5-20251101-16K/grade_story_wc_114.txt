<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s transition from a state of "fault-tolerant" avoidance to direct confrontation is masterfully internalized. The trait of "peripheral awareness" is not merely a label but a demonstrated behavior that constrains her interaction with the painting until the breaking point. Her final choice to descend feels earned by the preceding struggle with the "swallowed truth," carrying a visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from the fever-state status quo to a Decisive Change (leaving the mountain). While the discovery of the hidden message after seventeen years relies slightly on the convenience of the "fever-cleared eyes," the causal link of the smudge action grounds it physically. The closure lands with the tangible cost of abandoning her sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is active rather than static; the instruments provide the specific vocabulary for Mira’s worldview ("probability wearing a mask"). The auroral light and the "houses like scattered seeds" effectively charge the emotional beats. The isolation is not just atmospheric but a structural constraint that pressures the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining safety in the margins vs. risking the pain of direct truth—is signaled early and escalated effectively. The act of smudging the paper functions as a tactile tightening of this conflict. The cost is legible: the destruction of the "fractured certainties" that sustained her for nearly two decades.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The integration of the "fault-tolerant" system metaphor with the human experience of grief is sophisticated and resonant. The story successfully reconfigures the concept of "margins" from a place of hiding to a place of truth, then moves that truth to the center at the end. The thematic closure feels inevitable yet non-didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register appropriate for the "oracle" persona without slipping into purple prose. The filter of the weather station operator is applied rigorously; she perceives emotion as pressure and probability. Narrative distance is controlled, zooming in smoothly for the revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high information density. There is a slight reliance on pathetic fallacy at the climax (the wind changing direction exactly as the revelation lands), which feels a touch convenient, but the line-level crafting of images like "petals curved like cupped hands" is evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the "lonely sentinel finding a hidden message from the past" is a familiar trope, the specific overlay of cybernetic/probability theory ("fault-tolerant") onto a gothic emotional arc provides a fresh texture. The execution elevates a standard premise into something distinct.</comment>
