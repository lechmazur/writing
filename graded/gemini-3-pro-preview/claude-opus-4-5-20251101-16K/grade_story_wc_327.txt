<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Verai is a compelling protagonist with a motivation deeply rooted in her lineage and loss. Her decision to translate texture into sound is a specific, character-driven response to the central conflict, and the final sacrifice is a powerful gesture. However, the emotional immediacy of that cost is slightly distanced by the swift transition to summary and the epilogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the method's discovery to the final transformation. The closure functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Verai becomes the song. The score is held back by the mid-story reliance on summary ("season into season") rather than dramatized scenes, and an epilogue that explains the outcome rather than letting the final image land the closure alone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the canyon of echoes and towers of bone are not just backdrop but the instrument of the plot. The sensory integration—"copper veins," "porous surface of ancient bone"—is vivid and specifically tailored to the theme of translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes (cultural extinction) are high and felt, and the escalation from translating walls to translating self is logical. However, the conflict is largely internal and managed through summary passages, lacking the acute, moment-to-moment pressure of a fully dramatized scenic confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of preserving memory through transformation is poignant. However, the ending falls into the "Thematic Echo" trap by explicitly stating the subtext ("They didn't know they were hearing the last dictionary... still refusing to let the silence have the final word"). This over-explanation dilutes the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift to an omniscient perspective in the epilogue is handled competently but creates a distance that softens the impact of Verai's final act.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and lyrical, with strong rhythm and imagery ("fractured the sun into spectra," "grief given voice"). The writing effectively supports the textural focus of the story without slipping into purple prose or confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "dying language" trope with the specific mechanics of synesthetic translation and the fossilized setting feels fresh and ingenious. The concept of the canyon as a physical archive of sound is memorable.</comment>
