<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Vesper serves as a flawless operator of the magic system rather than a character under pressure; while the "borrowed heartbeat" provides compelling backstory, it generates no immediate physical or psychological resistance in the scene to force a difficult choice or dramatize cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative functions as a linear procedural of a successful ritual without complication, deviation, or risk of failure; closure is a predetermined success state ("Earned Stasis" via completion) rather than a reconfiguration earned through narrative turns or overcoming resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sensory environment is lush and specific, effectively grounding the abstract magic in "wet stone," "violet" light, and "echoing" architecture; the terrace acts as a necessary amplifier for the sound magic, integrating setting directly into the method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent as the environment cooperates ("terrace held her voice"), the protagonist remains "perceptively calm," and the magic works on the first attempt; the stakes remain theoretical (others need hope) rather than immediate or perilous for the focalizer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("In a world where...") rather than emerging solely from subtext or action; while the "reflection as window" concept is cohesive, the moral is stated didactically rather than dramatized through ambiguity or hard-won insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, lyrical distance that suits the material well; the control of psychic distance is steady, though it leans heavily towards the observational and descriptive rather than the visceral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense, fitting the musical motif without technical errors; however, phrasing occasionally leans toward the precious ("bruised violet," "impossible colors") and the lack of narrative friction makes the beauty feel static.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound, light, and reflection creates a fresh magic system; however, the story structure follows a familiar "magical craftsman heals the world" template without subverting expectations, risking failure, or adding grit to the execution.</comment>
