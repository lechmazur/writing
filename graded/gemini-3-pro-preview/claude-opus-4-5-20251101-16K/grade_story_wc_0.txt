<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The transition from professional detachment to vulnerability is the story's core arc, grounded in specific sensory details. While the pivot relies briefly on a diagnostic label ("Humility kindled") rather than purely embodied reaction, the final renunciation of her "preprocessing" defense is earned and effectively dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Causal drive leading to a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration. The pivot from surveying damage to making the call is fully motivated by the setting, and the closure lands with a visible cost—the cracking voice and the surrender of control—that makes the change undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The micro-setting of the butterfly dust is exceptionally integrated, functioning as the primary constraint that forces the protagonist's realization. The specific physical environment—ruined but iridescent—actively shapes the choice to connect rather than merely serving as a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly braided between the professional desire for efficiency and the personal need for connection. The pressure escalates coherently through the visual accumulation of the dust, forcing a stance change that is paid for with the loss of emotional composure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis of stellar decay and microscopic biological remnants is resonant and intellectually satisfying. The concept of "gradual change" unifies the scientific backstory with the immediate domestic tragedy, delivering depth without abstract moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice consistently filters the world through the protagonist's scientific expertise ("data streams," "magnetar decay") even during emotional beats. The collapse of this filter at the end is a precise, voice-driven execution of the character's arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery like voicemails accumulating "like sediment." A few phrases lean slightly toward cliché ("like a whisper") or abstract telling ("Humility kindled"), but the overall propulsion and clarity are high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Combining high-energy astrophysics with the delicate decay of a greenhouse offers a fresh, specific angle on the "returning home" narrative. The use of wing dust as a measure of time and tragedy transforms a familiar premise into something distinct.</comment>
