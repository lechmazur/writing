<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vera’s internal landscape of isolation and duty is drawn with clarity, establishing a distinct, melancholy dignity. However, her emotional arc is relatively static; the connection to the daughter feels authentic but serves more as texture than a driver of difficult choices under pressure. The transition from observer to active participant is subtle, lacking a sharp moment of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path under an Accumulative lens, successfully building atmospheric pressure to a resonant closure of "Earned Stasis." The scientific explanation of the ghosts in the middle acts as a slight drag on momentum, resolving mystery via exposition rather than dramatized discovery, but the final image lands effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sensory details of the thermal mapping—translating emotion into color and heat—create a vivid, specific atmosphere. The cave setting is grounded, though the "factually mystical" rules are delivered somewhat abstractly rather than purely through interaction. The integration of the fossil as a tactile anchor effectively bridges the setting and character memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily thematic and observational; while the pressure of the "unknown" is felt, there is little external opposition or cost to Vera’s actions. She witnesses and records without facing a dilemma that forces a trade-off, keeping the narrative tension relatively low despite the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "transitional objects" bridging states of existence is woven tightly into the narrative logic and imagery. The story relies slightly too much on explicit statement ("Transitional objects worked this way...") to deliver its thesis, but the final image successfully resonates with the core concept without needing further explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, measured tone that suits the protagonist's role as an archivist and map maker. The distance is well-calibrated, though it occasionally slips into an explanatory register that feels more like a guide than an immersed perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and flows well, with strong imagery regarding the heat-mapping. However, the text leans on expository telling to explain the magic system ("The factually mystical explanation was simpler...") and the thematic significance of the fossil, which dilutes the immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The combination of human hibernation and emotional heat-mapping offers a fresh aesthetic to the "last watcher" trope. While the "scientific explanation for ghosts" (crystalline resonance) is a familiar genre device, the synthesis of elements creates a distinct and memorable mood.</comment>
