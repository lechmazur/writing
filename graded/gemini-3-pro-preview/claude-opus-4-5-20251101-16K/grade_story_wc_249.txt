<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but emotional interiority often relies on summary labels ("simultaneously full and shattered," "grief could be heard") rather than fresh embodiment. The climax falls back on stock physical tells ("tears streamed") instead of specific, character-unique reactions to the impossible sight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure (Earned Stasis), but the progression is linear with minimal resistance; the ritual succeeds simply because she performs it. The lack of unforeseen complications or sharper causal turns makes the resolution feel somewhat inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is a vivid, integral environment that shapes the narrative logic effectively. However, relying on "colors that had no names" bypasses the opportunity for specific, inventive description in a story about sensory translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>External pressure is low; the garden responds "almost like recognition" without resisting, and no antagonist or time limit forces a difficult trade-off. The physical cost (bleeding palms) feels asserted rather than proportionate to the struggle shown on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of persisting consciousness is coherent, but the ending summarizes the meaning ("keeper of their entangled memories") rather than letting the image resonate on its own. This explicitness flattens the subtext into a concluding statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric melancholia suitable for the piece. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought stylization ("hush of the universe inhaling," "chord resolving after too long in dissonance") that draws attention to the writing over the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is functional but marred by clichés at pivotal moments ("tears streamed down her face," "terrible clarity," "full and shattered"). These stock phrases reduce the impact of the climax, trading precision for familiar sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi setting where sound manifests visually with a ghost story is creative and fresh. While the emotional beats of the reunion are standard, the "sound wave garden" provides a distinct and memorable backdrop.</comment>
