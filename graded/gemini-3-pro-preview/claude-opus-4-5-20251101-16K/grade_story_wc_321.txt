<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus's "resiliently positive" nature is consistent and drives his unique reaction of wonder over fear, distinguishing the voice. However, his lack of internal struggle or doubt lowers the dramatic tension, as his primary trait shields him from the crisis rather than forcing a complex adaptation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on an expository intervention—the spectral woman explains both the metaphysics and the specific solution—which weakens the protagonist's agency in discovery. While the closure is legible and the "arrival" choice lands clearly, the path there feels structurally convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "glass curved around absence" and the specific luminescence of the grotto create a vivid, atmospheric setting. The transition from the mundane "creak of the hull" to the surreal environment is grounded effectively in the protagonist's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stakes are high (total erasure), but the on-page tension is dampened by Marcus's immediate acceptance and the linear progression from problem to instruction to solution. The climax lacks a moment where failure feels plausible or a cost is viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of routine as a stabilizing anchor in chaos is well-developed and resonant. The final conceptual repricing—choosing "arrival" to collapse the quantum state—effectively marries the deckhand's job with the metaphysical stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and controlled, filtering cosmic events through the specific lexicon and priorities of a career mariner. The shift in scale from coiling rope to merging timelines is handled with consistent tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery (e.g., "slipped between frequencies"). A few moments of telling ("resiliently positive by nature") slightly mar an otherwise high-quality execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Using a ferry's routine as the mechanism to heal a time fracture is a fresh, specific angle. However, the "multiverse repair via radio coordinates" trope and the encounter with an alternate self are familiar genre elements that reduce ingenuity.</comment>
