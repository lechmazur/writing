<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eleanor is a consistent focalizer, but her agency is largely retrospective; the core action (organizing) occurs in summary rather than on-page scenes. Her "hearing unspoken words" functions more as a convenient trait than a source of active, dramatized struggle or immediate cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on a summary block ("For weeks, she had visited...") to convey the central plot, leaving the present timeline as a low-tension observation loop. While the "Charged Poise" closure is legible, the lack of on-page causal turns weakens the structural drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and grounded, with the library and grotto providing distinct sensory anchors ("blue-shadowed stacks," "iron in the ancient rocks"). The mist and the visual of the window displays effectively support the mood of quiet rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Immediate dramatic pressure is absent; the protagonist has already acted before the story begins, and the present timeline offers no active opposition or escalating stakes. The conflict with the Council is abstract and retrospective rather than a live, on-page crucible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of "silence as speech" and the chess metaphor are coherent, though the execution leans toward the didactic ("teaching children the language of patience"). The connection between the window displays and the grandmother's legacy adds resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and maintains a consistent lyrical tone ("liminal hour," "indifferent and ancient"). While effective for the atmospheric intent, the register occasionally drifts into slightly ornamental adjectival phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with clear imagery ("dreaming in green"). However, there are minor repetitions of key phrases ("humble rebellion," "unspoken words") and some standard metaphors ("like a memory refusing to fade") that reduce freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of a quiet, synchronized rebellion is earnest but familiar, and the "saving the town" trope plays out safely. The combination of chess strategy and the magnetic grotto offers a spark of novelty, but the low-risk execution limits impact.</comment>
