<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence is well-established, making her silent communication through the stones a deeply character-specific choice. The shift from delivery pilot to keeper of the legacy is earned by her history of observation ("filed these observations away like sea charts"). Her internal motivation is clear, though the explicit diagnostic thought ("wanted to bottle... the feeling of being found") feels slightly more like authorial summary than inhabited interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is elegant, moving from a premonition to a discovery and finally to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's life purpose. The closure is excellent: the decision to return and maintain the chain creates a legible "after" state with the specific cost of a monthly pilgrimage to a decommissioned light. The lens of Accumulative observation shifts seamlessly into Causal agency at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is not just atmospheric; it provides the mechanism for the story's central conflict and resolution. The stones and sea glass function as a micro-setting that constrains the character's available means of expression ("a language without names"). The final image of the "salt-crusted glass" and "fractured rainbows" charges the closure with specific, tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but significant: the preservation of human connection against the "vast indifference" of nature. The escalation works well, moving from the physical storm to the metaphysical void left by the keeper, which Maren fills. The pressure is consistent, though the "cost" of her decision is largely future-tense (the commitment to return) rather than an immediate sacrifice in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of anonymous legacy and "being found" is powerfully integrated into the stone-stacking mechanic. The final beat resonates strongly, recontextualizing the lighthouse from a navigational aid to a memorial. The translation of the stones ("I mattered. Remember.") is a touch explicit—risking moralizing—but the preceding action earns the sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently atmospheric and tuned to the protagonist’s reticent nature. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though the "bottle the feeling" line reads a bit close to a thesis statement. The rhythm of the prose mirrors the measured, quiet action of the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm and clear imagery, but relies on several stock phrases that dull its impact ("hungry sea," "surrendered its final breath," "dawn bled"). While "luminous ache" works well as the required tone, the surrounding descriptors lean heavily on familiar literary shorthand rather than fresh observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a stone-stacking language for lighthouse keepers is distinct and imaginatively developed. Using the sea glass as a new "word" introduced by the protagonist allows for a satisfying, non-obvious synthesis of the prompt elements. The story takes a familiar setting and reinvigorates it with a specific, inventive ritual.</comment>
