<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is deeply embodied; the tension between the subversiveness of the lantern work and the release of the cranes creates a complex internal landscape. The "complete child from memory" goal is a strong, desperate driver that justifies the ritual. The acceptance of "luminous torment" earns the stasis ending through clear emotional logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, building texture toward an Earned Stasis closure where the protagonist reaffirms her costly ritual. However, the scene lacks a singular, acute pressure point that distinguishes this specific night from any other; the priest "looking the other way" defuses the external threat, leaving the subversiveness theoretical rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative and strictly controlled, with the "glass basilica" and "silver-leafed tea plants" grounding the magical realism. The spatial paradox of "descending while ascending" is effectively woven into the physical action of the climax, charging the final image with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Internal conflict is palpable, but the external stakes are lowered by the lack of active opposition; the "illegal" nature of dream recording carries no immediate risk in the scene. Escalation relies on the arrival of "detachment hour," which functions as a clock but does not force a new tactical choice beyond the established routine.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "beauty and anguish inseparable" is beautifully realized through the dual motifs of lanterns (holding on) and cranes (letting go). The ending resonates powerfully, reframing the protagonist's grief not as a burden to be cured but as a necessary connection to the dead. (Capped per rubric rules due to Q2 score).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, perfectly suiting the "frozen prayer" atmosphere. Narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to Mira’s perception of the "ghost-light" and the "shadow."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with strong sensory details like "fingers thick and stupid." Minor deductions for the repetition of the phrase "luminous torment" (appears twice as a label) and a slight over-reliance on adjective-heavy description in the opening beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream mining, origami rituals, and the spatial paradox of the floating isle creates a distinct and memorable world. While "collecting memories of the dead" is a familiar trope, the specific mechanical execution here—polishing gems to hold light—feels fresh.</comment>
