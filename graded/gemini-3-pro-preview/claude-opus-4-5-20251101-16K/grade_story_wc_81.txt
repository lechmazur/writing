<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's internal landscape is drawn with precision; the realization that she had been "living inside machinery's heartbeat" effectively grounds her transformation. Her motivation to find order transitions naturally into a moral stance under pressure, and the choice to record the truth feels earned by her established temperament.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drive lens (Causal) holds firmly from the blackout to the final action. The inciting incident directly enables the discovery (light conditions changing perception), and the closure—repurposing the tool of deception—lands as a decisive change in stance with implied cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the shift from mechanical noise/fluorescence to silence/bioluminescence fundamentally alters Mira's capacity to observe. The "weight of an ocean" provides a constant, tangible pressure that charges the atmosphere without needing excessive description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high, balancing immediate physical survival against the long-term preservation of truth. The escalation is psychological but potent, as the discovery of the stamp raises the conceptual cost of the narrative from error to betrayal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "reclaiming" truth from silence and darkness is well-executed. The final image of using the liar's stamp to authorize a new, honest record offers a resonant reconfiguration of the story's central motif without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent "logical" texture that fits the protagonist's indexer training. The shift in perception is handled through this specific lens, ensuring that the emotional realization feels distinct to Mira rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong sensory imagery like "mechanical breathing" and the "blue-green silence." The writing avoids scaffold and moves efficiently, though a few required phrases feel slightly inserted ("tranquilly perceptive").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the "archivist in a dystopia" trope is familiar, the specific mechanism of bioluminescence revealing physical layering in documents is a fresh, specific detail. The synthesis of environmental pressure and investigative mystery feels organic.</comment>
