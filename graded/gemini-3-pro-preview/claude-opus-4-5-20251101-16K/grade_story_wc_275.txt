<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct presence with a clear worldview, though her pacifism is established via backstory rather than a high-pressure present-tense test. The stranger serves largely as a sounding board for her philosophy rather than a source of genuine interpersonal friction. The internal conflict regarding the blade is resolved too quickly to generate sustained character pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative establishes a clear scene but dissipates tension by dissolving into a summary montage ("The stranger stayed through summer...") at the closure. This structural shift flattens the specific causal arc of the encounter into a generalized fable, weakening the immediate impact of the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with evocative sensory detail; the "tranquil blaze" and "engraved quiet" create a palpable atmosphere. The physical environment of the dome effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, grounding the abstract themes in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain low throughout; the stranger arrives exhausted and compliant, offering no significant opposition or complication to Mira's goal. The tension is primarily theoretical (the potential for violence) rather than dramatized, resulting in a linear progression without a meaningful tightening or reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of cultivating values is central but delivered didactically through dialogue and exposition ("This was her method," "This was her motivation"). While the concept is coherent, the subtext is overlaid rather than emerging organically from the conflict or action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, maintaining a consistent tone that suits the "engraved quiet" of the setting. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory filtering rather than immediate immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative phrasing ("soft, rounder, held"). There is a reliance on scaffolding sentences ("This was her method...") that tells the reader how to interpret the action, but the line-level craft is otherwise high quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic gardener preserving civilization is a familiar trope, executed here with competence but without a radical fresh angle. The specific detail of weaving ballast scrap adds a nice textural layer to an otherwise standard "cozy catastrophe" vignette.</comment>
