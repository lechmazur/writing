<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, motivated protagonist with clear interiority and a distinct voice. However, her journey is somewhat frictionless; she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice in the scene, executing her plan without a "crucible" moment that tests her resolve against genuine opposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and causality is solid, leading to a valid closure where the beacon lights. The structure is linear and safe, lacking a significant turn or complication that would heighten the sense of earned success beyond the execution of a pre-established plan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with specific details like the "singing" glass and "moths that still remember brightness" grounding the post-collapse world. The "shard of hush" and the pavilion's geometry are well-integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are high (humanity's connection) but abstract; the on-page pressure is low as the protagonist faces no immediate obstacles or time crunches beyond the scheduled rising of Orion. The conflict is largely thematic (order vs. entropy) rather than a dramatic test of agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of coincidence as a language is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements ("Mira believes otherwise," "The universe will keep speaking") rather than subtext. The penultimate paragraph summarizes the moral, reducing resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like quality of the story. The distance is controlled, keeping the reader close to Mira's perception without slipping into unmotivated omniscience until the calculated shift at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("thistle-blown hope"). Some phrasing leans toward genre clichés ("grids died screaming"), but the line-level craft is generally high quality and propels the story well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic lighthouse keeper with retrocognition and a "coincidence engine" philosophy is fresh. While the emotional arc follows a traditional "healing the world" trope, the specific mechanics of the prism and stars add a layer of ingenuity.</comment>
