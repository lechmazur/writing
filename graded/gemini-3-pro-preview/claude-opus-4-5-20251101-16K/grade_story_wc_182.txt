<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vera's competence drives the plot, and her choice at the end is active and significant. However, dialogue often leans into exposition to explain plot mechanics ("The Library exists in those spaces"), and the specific attribute "carefully resourceful" is applied as a label rather than purely demonstrated behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structural arc is excellent, moving cleanly from the meeting to the realization to the subverted rescue. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, recontextualizing the mission from extraction to preservation with clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting of the hollowed mountain and the "gaps" between shelves is evocative and functional, directly serving the plot's resolution. The shift from physical shelves to metaphysical spaces is handled well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and escalate through the interaction with the time traveler. The climax involves a genuine decision that alters the outcome—Vera chooses to join the burden rather than remove the girl, a meaningful deepening of the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of preserving unlearned lessons is strong and cohesive. The ending leans slightly into sentimentality ("The mountain sang"), but the core concept of valuing the difficult lesson over the easy rescue resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, but the dialogue suffers from "as-you-know" exposition, particularly when the time traveler explains the library's mechanics. The voices are distinct enough, but the informational load weighs them down.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of the specific phrase "carefully resourceful" (lines 14 and 49) acts as a noticeable artifact/loop. It reads as a forced insertion rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of the bookstore setting, the time traveler foil, and the "library of unlearned lessons" is fresh. The subversion of the rescue mission adds a layer of ingenuity to the standard trope.</comment>
