<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is poignant and grounded in specific grief, particularly through the gear metaphor. However, her agency is diluted in the climax; the magical setting effectively solves the puzzle for her ("reflections moved when she did not"), making the growth feel observed rather than enacted through difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative arc with legible orientation and closure. While the resolution lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of her grief, the lack of resistance—doors opening at a touch, mirrors providing instructions—renders the outcome smooth rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is excellent, leveraging the "frozen" constraint to heighten the tactile fragility of the clockwork. The sensory specificity of the oil ("pine resin and rendered fat and something metallic") is a standout moment that effectively anchors the memory in the physical scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly emotional, but the escalation is minimal; Vera faces no significant external opposition or internal hesitation once inside. The "cost" is atmospheric but doesn't force a difficult trade-off or active tactical shift; success feels inevitable from the moment of entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of repair-as-understanding is cohesive. However, the ending over-articulates the subtext ("some broken things must remain broken until..."), converting earned resonance into a summary moral that diminishes the power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, suiting the fable-like mode without slipping into purple prose. The narrative distance is managed well, allowing the setting's magic to filter naturally through Vera's specific emotional lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm and high information density. While "springs coiled tight as secrets" is a slight cliché, the line-level craft is otherwise fresh and precise, avoiding scaffold artifacts and maintaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lunar-eclipse locksmith with a hall of ice mirrors is imaginative and aesthetically distinct. The "clockwork of memory" trope is familiar, but the specific setting and the sensory details of the oil give it a fresh execution.</comment>
