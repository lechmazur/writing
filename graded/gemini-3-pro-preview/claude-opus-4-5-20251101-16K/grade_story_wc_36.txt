<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira is a strongly motivated protagonist with a clear, embodied burden of guilt. However, her internal arc culminates in a diagnostic realization ("The flaw had not been in the weave... it had been in her teaching") that feels more like intellectual processing than a visceral, character-driven epiphany, slightly distancing the emotional impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal lens, moving effectively from ritual preparation to a decisive action. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (changing the song), though the impact is dampened by the explanatory summation of the lesson learned immediately prior to the final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustic properties of the canyon physically enable the climax. Sensory details like "sun a rumor" are vivid, though the description of the silence relies on a tautological construction ("silence... avalanchingly quiet") that weakens the specific atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure is well-established through the weight of the silence and the trembling physical markers of guilt. The stakes are clear and personal. The resolution, while earned, feels slightly lowered by the tidy intellectual solution ("taught the art of recovery") rather than a messier, more costly emotional trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story leans heavily into explicit moralizing. Phrases like "failure demands humility" and the final line ("learned to forgive herself") state the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate through subtext. This didactic approach flattens the complexity of the grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a solemn, mythic tone appropriate for the subject matter. It is controlled and distinct, though it occasionally lapses into standard fantasy rhetoric ("ancient shore," "unknown territory") rather than maintaining a unique perceptual signature throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, but suffers from specific artifacts. "The silence here was avalanchingly quiet" is a tautology, and "the insight cut deep" is a cliché. These slips in precision detract from otherwise solid line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic echoes preserving a moment of failure is imaginative and handled well. However, the thematic turn—a perfectionist teacher realizing they failed to teach resilience—is a familiar trope that isn't significantly transformed by the fresh setting.</comment>
