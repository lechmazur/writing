<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is deeply integrated with trade details; the shift from chanting formulas to Sava's name at the climax effectively externalizes the internal transformation from grief to defiance. The specific knowledge of "strontium for red" grounds the emotional arc in distinct competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, delivering a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The resolution is swift—the search phase feels slightly compressed for the scope—but the closure lands with earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "Blooming Fortress" is rendered with vivid, thematic imagery ("roses conquered siege towers") that perfectly parallels the central conflict. The setting acts as an active participant in the theme of reclamation rather than just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "starless sky" provides effective atmospheric pressure, though the external obstacles are minimal. The conflict is primarily internal, resolved through a shift in perspective rather than a forced trade-off or high-cost tactical choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of creating hope within despair is resonant and well-earned by the final image. The explicit message in the mosaic ("Make light anyway") risks being too directive/moralizing, but the specific context of the fireworks trade grounds it effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending the technical precision of the protagonist's craft with a lyrical, reverent tone. The control of psychic distance is steady, keeping the reader close to Mira's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchors ("night smelled of jasmine"). Occasional phrases like "gravity of hopelessness" lean toward abstraction, but the line-level craft is generally high-quality and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The specific lens of fireworks chemistry applied to a "wandering ruin" narrative offers a fresh aesthetic. While the core trope of a "dead mentor's final instruction" is familiar, the execution via specific trade details elevates the premise.</comment>
