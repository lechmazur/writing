<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Morrow’s specific condition serves as a compelling engine for agency, transforming disability into a procedural hunt. The late reveal of the "mother's voice" effectively grounds the abstract goal in a specific, embodied emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative loop creates a strong Earned Stasis closure; the return to the start feels inevitable and tragic rather than merely repetitive. The logic of the "precognitive forgetfulness" drives the plot mechanics with rigorous consistency, holding the lens clearly to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is a distinct, atmospheric crucible that physically manifests the themes of memory and decay. The hollow sphere acts as a potent micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but pressurized by the fleeting nature of the visions; the tension between holding and losing is palpable. The cost is rendered visibly on the page when the specific memory dissolves into a generic instruction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of archiving the intangible is beautifully realized through the central mechanic. The resonance of the "prophet of discarded futures" lands with earned weight, offering a clear conceptual repricing of the character's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is cohesive, blending lyrical description with the procedural grit of Morrow’s method. The melancholic tone is sustained well, successfully navigating the risk of melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich, though occasionally reliant on dense or abstract similes (e.g., "thick as grief") that flirt with overwriting. The synesthetic descriptions of sound in the climax are particularly effective and well-controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "junkyard prophet" archetype with the specific mechanics of ephemeral prophecy feels fresh. The concept of seeking the "sound of growing older" provides a unique and poetic narrative hook.</comment>
