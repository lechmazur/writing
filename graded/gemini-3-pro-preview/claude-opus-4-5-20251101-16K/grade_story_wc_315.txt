<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is well-rendered, anchoring the dilemma in a specific, embodied grief. The connection between the reflex to check the buckle and the decision to re-verify the signal creates a coherent character arc. However, the "muscle memory" realization feels slightly didactic, functioning more as a thematic lesson than a raw emotional impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, with the inciting incident (radio report vs. visual evidence) driving directly to the climax. However, the resolution relies on a "misunderstanding" revealed by new data (the fourth light), which validates the authority figure and deflates the potential conflict rather than forcing a difficult choice between truth and obedience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the cloud layer and the specific vantage point of the arbor constrain the protagonist's information, directly driving the plot. Sensory details like "fingers reaching for forgotten gods" establish a strong, albeit slightly elevated, atmosphere that suits the "watcher" archetype.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pressure is immediate and coherent, forcing a clear stance crystallization. The stakes are palpable (accusation vs. negligence). The score is capped because the resolution—discovering the initial reading was simply incomplete—removes the external antagonism, converting a potential high-stakes defiance into a procedural correction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of vigilance is integrated well into the action, but the ending relies heavily on explicit moralizing ("Trust... was not about certainty," "The watcher's burden was..."). This explanatory summary in the final paragraph flattens the resonance, telling the reader exactly what the story meant rather than letting the image speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the "sacred" nature of the duty. Internal monologue flows naturally into action. The transition from the memory of Marcus back to the present is handled smoothly without disorienting the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic. There are moments of "purple" overwriting (e.g., "soundless echo," "universe forgetting how to speak") that border on melodramatic, but the line-level momentum remains strong and the imagery is visually distinct.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "watcher in the clouds" concept is atmospheric and engaging. While the "dead partner teaches a lesson" trope is familiar, the specific implementation through the parachute buckle and the signal code adds a nice layer of specificity. The resolution feels safe, avoiding the riskier path of genuine institutional conflict.</comment>
