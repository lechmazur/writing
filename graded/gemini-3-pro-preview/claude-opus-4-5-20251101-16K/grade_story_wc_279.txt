<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct protagonist with a clear internal struggle and occupational lens ("artist eye"). However, the explicit labeling of her attribute ("socially perceptive enough to notice") relies on telling rather than showing, and the pivot relies heavily on the mentor figure explaining the theme rather than Mira arriving at it solely through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, holding the "Situational/Accumulative" lens effectively from the "unlearning" premise to the resolution. The closure (sacrificing the tile to the mandala) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The mentor's arrival is slightly convenient, but the structural integrity is high.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustic properties of the grotto and the tactile details of the tile and sand mandala constrain and shape the realization. The "lilac-colored" terror establishes a specific, cohesive atmosphere that permeates the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stakes are internal and philosophical (Order vs. Void), suitable for this length. The escalation is subtle—moving from fear to understanding—but the sacrifice of the tile provides a concrete, felt cost to the change in stance. The conflict resolution feels slightly eased by the guide's exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "space" replacing "answers" is woven masterfully through the occupational details (chalk art) and the central metaphor (unlearning). The ending avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant image (drawing in the darkness) that reconfigures the initial deficit into a new capacity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly matching the "lilac unease" tone. The narrative distance is managed well, keeping close to Mira’s perceptions. The transition between observation and the mentor's dialogue is handled smoothly without jarring shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("mist hung like gauze"), with strong rhythm. The score is held back only by the clumsy integration of the required attribute ("Her social perceptiveness told her"), which reads as a label-insertion artifact rather than organic narration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of "the unlearning" as a gentle, non-violent apocalypse is fresh and executed with great specificity. Combining this with the acoustic/tactile imagery of the whispering gallery tile creates a unique, memorable synthesis of elements.</comment>
