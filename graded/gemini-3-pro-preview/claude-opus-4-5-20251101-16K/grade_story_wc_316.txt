<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kira's motivation (defeating numbness) is clear and drives the scene, and the "ego death" backstory effectively colors her internal state. However, the pivot from adversarial to cooperative is rapid; the internal struggle is summarized ("pretense collapsed") rather than fully dramatized before the admission, making the shift feel slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scene has a clear arc and legible closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the resolution relies heavily on Master Chen's authority to dictate the synthesis ("Go. Raise your daughter together"). While Kira has the realization, the external validation from the Master tidies up the ending too neatly, reducing protagonist agency in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "churn of clouds" and "glass cylinder" anchor the abstract legal/philosophical concepts in physical reality. The lenient physics and temporal shifts are established early and used to color the atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (custody) is established well, but the conflict de-escalates quickly once Kira speaks. The tension dissolves into agreement without a significant on-page cost or complication following the realization, making the "battle" feel lower pressure than the premise suggests.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but culminates in an explicit moral statement by Master Chen ("identity is not possession—it is practice") in the final dialogue. This overt didacticism replaces narrative resonance with a summarized lesson, triggering the penalty for moralizing endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending legalistic and mystical tones effectively to suit the world ("subpoenaed as evidence," "vivify"). Internal monologues are consistent with Kira's detached/numb state, though there is occasional reliance on filter verbs ("Kira felt," "Kira realized").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent with some strong word choices ("calcify," "churn"), but relies on filter verbs at key moments ("Kira felt something crack open") and some standard similes ("like morning frost," "like a blade"). The exposition block in the second paragraph slows momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a custody battle for a soul in a floating dojo is highly original and engaging. The synthesis of legal drama and metaphysical sci-fi offers a fresh angle, though the resolution treads familiar "two halves of a whole" territory.</comment>
