<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is beautifully rendered, grounding the spectral protagonist in a concrete need to communicate that persists beyond death. The internal conflict between her habit of silence and the urge to connect drives the narrative to a decisive action. The choice to reach out to the caretaker feels earned by the specific observation of shared "heaviness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, building pressure through memory and atmosphere until the act of encoding provides a Resonant Reconfiguration. While the ending relies on a projected future reaction ("She would trace...") rather than a confirmed interaction, the on-page act of marking the stone provides sufficient closure. The causal link between the caretaker's arrival and Mira's action is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the story's logic; the "stone terraces" and "mist" are not just backdrop but the medium of the protagonist's existence. The specific tool—the "flower press bolt plate"—is an excellent, tactile object that grounds the ethereal concept in physical labor. The environment meaningfully constrains the character's method of expression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal (silence vs. expression) but is externalized effectively through the physical act of scratching stone during a storm. The stakes—emotional connection across the barrier of death—are clear and felt. The tension tightens appropriately with the storm's arrival, serving as a catalyst for the encoded message.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "voice leaking sideways" is resonant and organic to the premise. The score is held back slightly from the highest bands because the thematic thesis is explicitly stated in the text ("Your silence is not your cage") rather than remaining entirely subtextual, though framing it as the encoded message mitigates this significantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and atmospheric tone that suits the "ghost in code" concept. The POV remains firmly anchored in Mira's unique perception ("no eyes to open"), filtering the world through her spectral limitations and history without unmotivated slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with evocative imagery ("slow gray whales," "watercolor across the wet stone"). There are minor traces of adverb reliance ("driftingly alert," "truly woke," "finally, truly heard") which slightly soften the impact, but the rhythm generally supports the atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story with "graffiti code" and a floating monastery setting creates a distinct and memorable premise. The specific mechanism of haunting—through manual labor and encoded art rather than scares—feels fresh and emotionally grounded.</comment>
