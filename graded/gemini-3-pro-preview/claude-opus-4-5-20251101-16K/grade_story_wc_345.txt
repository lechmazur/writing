<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira functions primarily as a conduit for the ghost's agency rather than a fully realized protagonist with distinct interiority. Her "choice" to lead feels mandated by instruction rather than forged in pressure, and her ability to sway the crowd is summarized rather than dramatized through specific interpersonal dynamics. The "family" dynamic is asserted in backstory but not tested or shown in the present crisis until the convenient resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The climax relies on a soft reset where a "clear tone" and a brief speech instantly resolve deep existential panic and factionalism. The causal link between ringing a small brass bell and a fractured community suddenly agreeing to a dangerous spaceflight is tenuous and unearned. The ghost effectively solves the plot; the protagonist merely executes the instructions, reducing the sense of earned closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "floating rock arches" effectively doubling as both atmosphere and a ticking clock. The integration of the orchard elements with the sci-fi collapse creates a specific, textured world. The sensory details of the chalk and the amber skies ground the fable-like tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The physical stakes are high and clear (planetary destruction), but the social conflict ("community fractured") evaporates too easily. The escalation moves from panic to unity without a sufficient "middle beat" of struggle or trade-off; the crowd yields to the bell immediately, bypassing the necessary friction that would make the unity feel earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit lecture rather than subtext; Mira literally defines the moral ("reexamine what they knew about hope") in a speech. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the resonance, converting potential insight into a sermon. The ending image is nice, but the prior moralizing drains its power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift from the collective "everyone knew" to Mira's limited perspective is managed well, though the summary of the climatic speech distances the reader from the raw emotion of the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but leans on familiar similes ("like fire through dry brush," "bones of forgotten giants"). The mechanics are clean, but the reliance on these stock descriptors in key descriptive beats holds the writing back from freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "ghost gardener" concept is charming and the specific method (chalk) is memorable. However, the plot arc—fleeing a dying world for a mythical sanctuary—is a standard trope, and the execution follows a predictable path without subverting the "myth is real" expectation.</comment>
