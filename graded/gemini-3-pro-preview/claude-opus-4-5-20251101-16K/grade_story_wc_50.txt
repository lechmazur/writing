<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (grief) is clearly stated, but the reliance on iterative summary prevents embodied interiority or micro-choices under pressure. We are told of her obsession and approach rather than seeing her struggle against resistance in a specific, dramatized moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story operates as a synopsis of a season rather than a dramatized scene, violating the default scope expectation and distancing the reader from the pivotal turn. While the closure (using the echo) is conceptually resonant, it lands as a summarized state of being rather than a decisive, high-stakes change on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sensory details of the Resonance Hall (light angles, acoustic properties) are vivid and functionally integrated, actively constraining the protagonist's method. The setting feels distinct and essential to the mechanism of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is internal and resolved through summarized competence ("She learned to collect") rather than active struggle against an obstacle. The lack of an on-page antagonist or a moment where failure seems imminent flattens the tension; the stakes are theoretical rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of preserving wonder in the "cellar of reason" is potent and well-developed. However, the ending leans into explicit moralizing ("Some wonders, she had learned...") which summarizes the thesis rather than letting the resonance emerge solely from the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished, consistent, and suitably melancholic, fitting the fable-like tone. It maintains a distinct texture ("twilight of a wounded season") that elevates the summary mode, though it does not fully compensate for the lack of scenic immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is high-quality with strong imagery ("worn soft as river stones") and good rhythm. There are minor instances of filtering and telling ("Maren was reflective by nature," "She documented everything") that reduce density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting echoes into a reverse-engineered timer is imaginative and fresh. While the execution follows a somewhat standard healing-fable trajectory, the specific synthesis of locksmithing and acoustics feels original.</comment>
