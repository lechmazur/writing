<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, well-drawn protagonist whose transition from avoidance to acceptance is the story's clear engine. However, the pivotal emotional shift relies on summary diagnostic statements ("She wept for the years...") rather than letting the embodied action speak for itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, linking the situational setup (the bloom) to the tool (lantern) and the object (vial). The closure is a valid Decisive Change (opening the vial), though the sudden appearance of the written message feels like a slightly convenient accelerant for the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is exceptional; the "rain on summer stone" and "bread baking" ground the fantastical premise in visceral reality. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, and the final image of dawn through glass successfully charges the emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and clearly escalated by the ticking clock of the rose's transformation. The resolution, however, feels slightly lowered by the external permission granted by the mother's message, relieving the protagonist of the full weight of the decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story suffers significantly from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraphs ("Some lights... were meant to reveal..."). By explaining the theme directly to the reader ("memories... not something to fear"), the narrative flattens subtext into instruction, violating the show-don't-tell standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the atmospheric content. The POV remains tightly anchored to Maren, effectively filtering the world through her specific history of "aromatic caution" and grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative ("fractured prisms"), creating a strong mood. However, the tendency to summarize emotional epiphanies ("She understood now") rather than dramatizing them creates a slight drag on the line-level momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a scent-based magic system with a grief narrative is creative and effective. While the "message from the grave" trope is familiar, the specific mechanism of the UV lantern adds a fresh, tactile layer to the discovery.</comment>
