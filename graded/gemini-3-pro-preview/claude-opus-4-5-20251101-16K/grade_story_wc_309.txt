<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Meris is a consistent protagonist with a clear motivation that drives the narrative forward. However, her internal landscape is somewhat static, defined more by her archetypal opposition to the "engines" than by a complex, contradictory struggle in the moment; the "underachieving" label is stated but not deeply dramatized in the action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the burden is transformed into permanent light—lands effectively with the cost of the lost stone. The "nothing happened / then everything did" beat is a pacing cliché that momentarily flattens the climactic tension before the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The setting is established with some evocative phrases ("vapor and prayer"), but the spire itself relies on standard "cathedral of ice" tropes. The sensory details of the grandmother's garden (scent, soil) are more vivid and grounded than the immediate, high-altitude environment, which feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, with the climb providing physical pressure that complements the thematic conflict. While the external opposition (the engines) is distant, the physical exertion and the final relinquishing of the artifact provide a sufficient, albeit quiet, cost to the character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism, particularly in the final third where the narration explicitly explains the moral ("Some light lingers because..."). This essayistic, overly articulated meaning undermines the resonance of the imagery and tells the reader what to feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like tone that suits the subject matter, though it occasionally slips into repetitive sentence structures ("She climbed," "She reached," "She understood"). The voice successfully balances the melancholy of the past with the determination of the present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from abstraction in key moments ("emotion made visible, joy given form"), relying on telling the reader the significance rather than showing it through concrete sensory details. The text is readable but lacks the density and freshness required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of manual magic versus automated creativity is a familiar contemporary metaphor handled here with standard genre tropes. While the "mist walking" is a nice touch, the overall execution follows a predictable parable structure without a fresh, subversive turn or specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
