<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s primary trait (“richly perceptive”) is stated as a label rather than purely demonstrated through struggle. While her motivation is clear, her internal landscape lacks contradiction; she moves through the scene with competence but without a distinct, costly internal dilemma that forces a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scene follows a clear causal arc with a valid conceptual repricing at the closure (the dead choose, Keepers don't control). However, the "webs of intrigue" and investigation are handled in a summary block that briefly stalls momentum, and the antagonist’s immediate flight upon the climax feels convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct; the “serpentine nexus” and the auditory details of the “hum” effectively ground the fantasy. The environment actively amplifies the climax, making the setting integral to the resolution rather than just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high (grandmother's soul), but the on-page pressure is moderate; the antagonist folds quickly once Mira acts, reducing the felt cost of the victory. The conflict remains largely external and ideological, lacking a moment where Mira is truly cornered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of agency in death (“the dead chose”) resonates well with the premise. However, the ending tilts toward the didactic, explicitly stating the moral message through the grandmother's voice rather than letting the image speak entirely for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, lyrical quality that suits the echo singer concept. The POV remains firmly with Mira, though some filtering (“she sensed,” “she could hear”) slightly distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative (“curve of nacre”), but the insertion of prompt phrases like “progressive disclosure” creates a jarring register clash, introducing technical/corporate diction into a mythic atmosphere. This artifact momentarily breaks the immersive spell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of canyon echo singers is fresh and offers a nice auditory twist on ghost stories. The reversal—that the ghosts are not trapped but choosing to stay—is a satisfying, if somewhat familiar, subversion of the "soul trapper" trope.</comment>
