<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren is a compelling, distinct protagonist whose past as a revolutionary organically informs her present academic rebellion. Her internal grief provides strong motivation, though the epiphany relies slightly on the asserted trait of being "poetically inclined" rather than solely on dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the Conceptual Repricing at closure—reclaiming the vessels as prayers—lands with resonant emotional logic. However, the climax (walking to the core after the storm) lacks significant obstacles or resistance, making the discovery feel slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and integral; the "baroque asteroid" and "temporal light" are not just backdrop but active forces that enable the protagonist's realization. The environment successfully charges the final image and constrains the characters via the storm protocol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Internal stakes are high and clearly defined, but the external conflict with the Council remains off-page and abstract. The storm provides atmospheric pressure but does not force a difficult tactical trade-off or dilemma beyond standard protocol.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The integration of the "defunct revolutionary" arc with the themes of grief and memory is masterful. The story resists a tidy moral, instead offering a poignant reflection on the persistence of meaning through "grief encoded in angles."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent tone of "burnished sorrow" that fits the material perfectly. The shift from observation to resolution is handled with strong control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense without feeling overwrought. Phrases like "grief encoded in angles" and "luminous moss" create a distinct texture. The rhythm supports the pacing well, with no significant artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-as-matter physics with baroque space archaeology creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The premise of an archaeologist-revolutionary fighting for the spiritual dignity of a dead culture feels original and earned.</comment>
