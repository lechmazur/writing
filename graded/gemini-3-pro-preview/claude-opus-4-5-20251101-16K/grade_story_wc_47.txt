<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Internal conflict (desire for silence vs. the intrusion of the viral world) is poignant and drives the scene. David's emotional turn is swift but grounded in the physical description of his "hollowed" state. The final choice to offer the pendant feels earned by Mira's characterization as someone seeking to "graft new meaning."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear, felt cost: Mira relinquishes her grandmother's protection to the brother who denied her trauma. The drive lens (Hybrid/Situational) holds firmly, with the setting providing the pressure that forces the interaction to a decisive point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the "cathedral of green velvet" and moss-claimed servers actively charge the theme of reclamation versus static memory. The environment acts as a third character, modeling the patience Mira seeks and directly influencing the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as the preservation of sanity amidst public exposure. The escalation—David’s intrusion into the sanctuary—forces a confrontation that tightens the emotional screws. The resolution feels like a genuine release of pressure rather than a convenient truce.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic interplay between viral "freezing," amber preservation, and moss growth is highly resonant. The score is held back slightly from the 9-band by the explicit thematic summary ("Mira understood now that some things needed to be remembered...") which tells rather than trusts the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately hushed, filtering the description through Mira's "watchful" persona. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing David's pain to be observed rather than inhabited, maintaining the POV's integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic, with strong sensory density. The structural repetition of the "Patient. Persistent..." triad frames the emotional arc effectively. The phrase "honeyed hush" appears three times, which verges on repetitive, but serves as a cohesive atmospheric anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a solarpunk-adjacent setting (mossy data center) with a gritty family trauma narrative creates a fresh, specific angle on the reconciliation trope. The imagery feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
