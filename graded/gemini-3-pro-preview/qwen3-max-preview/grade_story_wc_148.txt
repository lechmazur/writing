<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is emotionally resonant but logically murky; the urgency to act "before they find the bodies" contradicts the ending where "no bodies" are found, confusing the nature of his goal (concealment vs. revelation). While his internal burden of "mistrust" is compelling, the specific mechanics of his plan and his anticipation of the search party's discovery feel inconsistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent under a Causal lens, but the setup regarding the "bodies" functions as a false flag that resolves unsatisfactorily; the transition from fearing the discovery of corpses to the revelation of "only light" lacks a causal bridge. The closure is strong emotionally (Charged Poise), but the plot mechanics driving the ticking clock are slightly disjointed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strong point, with "brine and candle wax" and "iron gate" grounding the magical elements in a tangible reality. The lighthouse serves as an effective crucible, constraining the action and focusing the sensory details, though the "copperlight repose" repetition feels slightly forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—vindication of a legacy of truth—is clear and high, escalating well as the ghosts appear. However, the exact nature of the external threat (the search party finding bodies vs. finding him) wavers, softening the precision of the pressure in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of unheard truths and generational trauma is integrated well into the lighthouse imagery. The ending leans into didacticism ("Truth, made luminous") rather than letting the image speak for itself, but the core resonance remains effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice aims for a mythic, elevated tone but is undercut by awkward phrasing and grammatical slips ("it hover"). The clumsy opening designation ("cry wolf boy who cried wolf’s son") disrupts the narrative authority immediately.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant line-level errors undermine the literary aspiration: "it hover" creates a subject-verb agreement failure, and "slipped through the scuffs" is semantically nonsensical. Tense drift ("before they find" within past narration) and clunky phrasing distract from the otherwise vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of a sequel to the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" set in a spectral lighthouse is imaginative and fresh. The synthesis of fable and ghost story offers a unique angle, though execution flaws dampen the overall impact.</comment>
