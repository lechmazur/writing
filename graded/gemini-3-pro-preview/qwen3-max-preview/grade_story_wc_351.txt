<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by labels ("helix-minded," "archeologist") rather than behavior under pressure. Emotional processing is summarized via metaphor ("sugar in black coffee") rather than dramatized, leaving the internal struggle abstract and lacking visceral grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear process description without causal friction; the protagonist succeeds at her task without complication. Closure creates a thematic restatement rather than a decisive change with visible cost, leaving the arc feeling like a static vignette.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific ("shale," "juniper," "binary hoots"), effectively grounding the abstract mental work in a physical space. However, the environment serves largely as an atmospheric backdrop for internal monologue rather than offering constraints that force difficult choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the "modification" process meets no active resistance, risk of failure, or unintended consequence. The protagonist succeeds instantly using her "method," resulting in a static victory without escalation or meaningful stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story explicitly explains its theme repeatedly ("Not to escape, but to excavate," "Not to mourn... to modify"). Subtext is suffocated because the narrative constantly diagnoses the character's intent and the meaning of the action for the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and distinct but overly elevated and prone to melodrama ("ghosts in a prism," "silent scream"). The narrative distance is too close to the character's own romanticized self-perception, lacking the critical distance needed to create tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A severe rhetorical artifact pervades the text: the "not X, but Y" construction appears over a dozen times ("not sky, but shards," "not to fix, but to modify"). This repetitive scaffolding creates a monotonous, lecturing rhythm that halts narrative flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the "psychometric engineer" concept has potential, the execution relies on a "magical healing" trope that resolves complex grief with a wave of the hand. The story feels like a concept demonstration rather than a lived narrative with genuine risk.</comment>
