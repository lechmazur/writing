<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The protagonist functions well as a stoic archetype, with her internal logic ("smiles were for those who forgot") driving the narrative. While the visitor's arc is a standard fable beat, the Weaver's final micro-choice—to process her own grief but endure the cost—successfully deepens her characterization beyond a mere plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The structure is solid, moving efficiently from a demonstration of the magic system to a personal application that raises the stakes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis, with the protagonist reaffirming her burden; the "cost proof" is met by her refusal to seek freedom over endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral to the magic system, with the bronze/oxidation motif grounding the abstract concept of calcification. The environment actively constrains the ritual (aligning with the magnetic seam), satisfying the requirement for setting as a tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently from the professional duty of easing another's pain to the personal cost of the Weaver's own survival. The conflict is resolved through endurance rather than release, creating a legible price—loneliness and the weight of the "rusted locket"—that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of crystallizing grief to make it bearable is consistently developed through the central metaphor. While the narrative occasionally drifts into explicit moralizing ("Calcify was the word... not destroy"), the final image of the locket resonates with the established premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone suitable for a fable. However, the syntactic rhythm is frequently disrupted by a reliance on simile structures, causing the voice to feel repetitive and slightly less authoritative during key descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Simile density is excessive (~13 instances), creating a persistent syntactic loop that distances the reader ("like drowned fireflies," "like thin ice," "like a cave-in," "like seashell whorls"). This reliance on comparison over direct assertion dilutes the scene's immediacy and triggers the Patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central concept of a "fractal weaver" in a bronze grotto offers a fresh aesthetic gloss on the "sin-eater" trope. While the "grieving parent" plot beat is familiar, the specific mechanics of the magic system add enough ingenuity to elevate the piece.</comment>
