<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s drowsy alertness and skepticism create a distinct, grounded interiority. Her motivation—seeking calibration for guilt rather than thrills—is compelling and drives the narrative effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The climax relies on a causality break: a "corroded" radio physically playing a specific past broadcast in a tunnel is mechanically impossible without supernatural aid, yet the protagonist concludes the experience is "not haunted." This contradiction undermines the skeptic's arc and the story's internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is excellent, with sensory details like "breath of mildew" and "scuffed echoes" grounding the scene. The "beaded valve wheel" is described with tactile specificity that anchors the ghostly lore in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The internal stakes of guilt and confession are strong and escalate well as she enters the tunnel. However, the resolution of these stakes hinges on the convenient and illogical discovery of the radio, which softens the earned cost of the epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of guilt as a "ghost shift" is potent, but the story over-explains it in the denouement ("The ghost shift wasn’t spectral labor. It was the mind’s machinery..."). This didactic summary flattens the subtext right when it should resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending the "drowsy alertness" with a sharp, analytical edge. The shift from skepticism to emotional acceptance is handled well within the POV's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("scurried ahead like rats"). Minor overuse of the "Not X. Not Y. Just Z" sentence structure creates a repetitive cadence in the middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of industrial haunting as psychological projection is fresh. However, the "finding one's own voice on a mysterious radio" trope is familiar and, in this context, logically incoherent, limiting the story's ingenuity.</comment>
