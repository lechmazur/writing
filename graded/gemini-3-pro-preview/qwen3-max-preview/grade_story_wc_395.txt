<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, balancing professional competence with a growing, isolating obsession. Her transition from archivist to "anchor" is earned through specific actions (the ritual in the vault) and interior justifications ("Rhythm was memory’s last refuge"). The felt cost of her choices—social isolation and existence in the "between"—is effectively dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure effectively utilizes a mosaic/montage approach to compress a complex investigation into a short form while maintaining causality. The climax in the vault is a distinct, high-pressure moment that anchors the surrounding summary. Closure is strong, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's reality, though the heavy reliance on summary for the investigation phase slightly distances the reader from the discovery process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and integral to the plot; the archive is not just a backdrop but a "resonance chamber" that defines the story's logic. Sensory details like the "humming behind frosted glass" and the "scorched thread" of the patch ground the sci-fi elements in tactile reality. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate from professional curiosity to existential commitment. The conflict between the corporate desire to erase and the archivist's need to preserve creates coherent pressure. The cost—her disconnection from the living world to maintain the signal—is a tangible price paid for her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of digital persistence and the "ghost in the machine" is explored with nuance, moving beyond tropes to a specific thesis about rhythm and cadence as memory. The ending reweights the entire narrative, shifting the archive from a "mausoleum" to a living, humming ecosystem, offering a profound, non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistently melancholic, perfectly suiting the "corporate gothic" tone. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing access to the protagonist's secrets while maintaining the mystery of the setting. The rhetorical repetition ("She lied...") effectively reinforces her isolation and commitment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, utilizing sentence fragments and anaphora effectively to build tension ("Not randomly. Recurring."). The description of digital decay ("unraveled into the substrate") is particularly strong. Line-level craft is polished, with no significant artifacts or drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a space mission cold case with the mechanics of social media archival is fresh and compelling. The concept of "de-referencing" people rather than killing them offers a unique sci-fi angle on the ghost story genre. The execution feels specific and memorable.</comment>
