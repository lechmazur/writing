<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist has a clear role and internal state, but her "heartbreak" remains an abstract label ("folded neatly between folders") rather than a felt reality. Her emotions are performed through stock gestures ("trembling fingers," "breath catching") rather than specific, embodied reactions. The shift in her worldview is linear and lacks the friction of genuine internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure is coherent, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the investigation relies on a tenuous link where dust patterns physically narrate history ("ghost of a hand"), which strains credibility in a realistic setting. The resolution with the supervisor is a "soft reset," resolving potential conflict immediately with coffee and acceptance, lacking visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The setting is established clearly with sensory details (dust, light, folders). However, the description relies heavily on clichés ("dust motes danced," "slanted afternoon light") and poetic conceits that distance the reader from the physical reality of the space. The environment serves the theme but feels more like a stage set than a lived-in archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to handle the files—is present, but the conflict lacks genuine pressure or risk. The supervisor's skepticism is introduced and dismissed in a single exchange without consequence. The protagonist's choice to change her method incurs no cost—relational, professional, or emotional—resulting in a resolution that feels unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext. Phrases like "proof that love persists" and "unwritten anthem for the unseen" state the thesis directly to the reader. The ending summarizes the lesson ("She didn't heal by forgetting...") instead of allowing the dramatic action to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly sentimental, utilizing a "written" register that prioritizes poetic sounding phrases ("ellipses, not epilogues") over authentic observation. The dialogue is stiff and functional ("You’re turning files into memorials"), serving as a prompt for the thematic rebuttal rather than natural speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is competent but suffers from overwriting and purple artifacts ("whispers, in gradients," "silent ache," "gleaming faintly"). The opening image ("dust motes danced") is a well-known cliché. The reliance on abstract nouns and sentimental adjectives dilutes the vividness of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core concept—finding hope in tragic files—is a familiar trope handled here with standard sentimental beats. The "magical" reading of dust patterns attempts a fresh angle but feels disconnected from the realistic tone. The resolution follows a predictable, safety-hedging path without subverting expectations.</comment>
