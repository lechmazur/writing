<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict between skepticism and longing is well-dramatized, and the shift from "equations" to "convergence" is earned through the on-page experiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ascent-realization-descent structure creates a coherent situational arc, and leaving the amber provides a legible, cost-laden closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific ("iron-rich soil," "petrichor"), though the phrase "lichen spelled out equations" feels slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent under the situational lens, though the conflict remains abstract; the "data refusal" works as a turning point, but external stakes are low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("She had become part of the reaction") rather than trusting the final image, effectively flattening the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice successfully blends scientific lexicon with lyrical introspection, fitting the "academically rebellious" persona without breaking consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing (the "bronze quiet" motif appears three times; the "dusty footprints" phrase is repeated verbatim) and some purple prose reduce polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a scientific pilgrimage to a personal ghost is fresh, synthesizing sci-fi and mystical elements in a non-obvious way.</comment>
