<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as an archetype ("gentle radical") rather than a person, lacking internal contradictions or specific, grounded behavior. The antagonist’s sudden capitulation—crumbling from authoritarian menace to weeping father upon receiving a single tile—is unearned and dissolves the scene’s psychological realism. Motivation is declared in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the scene has a legible arc, causality breaks at the climax; the magistrate’s reversal relies on "narrative logic" (it happens because the theme requires it) rather than human reaction. The drive lens (Accumulative) builds a pattern of renaming, but the resolution feels unearned because the opposition offers no genuine resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but relies on standard ruin tropes ("shattered sky," "skeletal remains") without specific, tactile interaction beyond the tessera. The plaza feels like a stage set for the speech rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the characters’ choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Escalation is negligible; the magistrate appears to present a threat but collapses at the first rhetorical push, robbing the "aberrant mercy" of any demonstrated cost or "steel." The stakes are high in the abstract (justice, definitions) but low in the dramatized moment, as victory is achieved without sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didacticism ("Mercy is not a plea... It is a practice") and sentimental renaming (beggar to "keeper of stories"). The narrative explicitly preaches the moral in the final paragraph, collapsing subtext into a lecture and violating the show-don't-tell principle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, resulting in dialogue that reads like written manifestos rather than spoken language. The magistrate's immediate shift from distinct threat to sentimental echo flattens the voice distinction between characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("powdered grief," "whispered... mourning aloud") that feels ornamental rather than urgent. The insertion of the prompt term "retrocognitively trapped" creates a jarring register clash (clinical/jargon vs. mythic) that disrupts the established tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The central conceit of "renaming the world" is a familiar genre trope executed here with standard "hopepunk" beats. While the synthesis of elements is functional, the emotional trajectory—a speech that unifies the crowd and converts the villain—lacks freshness or unexpected edges.</comment>
