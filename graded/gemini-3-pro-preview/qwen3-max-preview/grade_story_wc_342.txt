<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Internal motivation is visceral and distinct, grounding the artistic impulse in tactile necessity rather than cliché. The character's face blindness is handled well as a sensory experience, though the midway epiphany ("believing her face blindness was a deficit") feels slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized through a resistance-and-breakthrough beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, adhering to a Situational drive lens that crystallizes the protagonist's stance under pressure. Closure is excellent: a Conceptual Repricing where the destruction of the art confirms its value as "atmosphere" rather than object, landing with undeniable cost and acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral, acting as both canvas and ticking clock; the hollowed tree and the coin constrain choices and shape the physical action. Sensory details are specific (moss-crusted, faint indentations) and filtered strictly through the protagonist's tactile bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (spiritual completion vs. physical destruction) and escalate through the encroaching demolition sounds. The cost is felt—the immediate loss of the masterwork—but the character's agency in choosing to finish anyway creates a satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The thematic inversion of currency-as-cosmos is resonant. However, the ending leans into explicit moralizing ("The limit she had discovered was not of her blindness... they saw faces and called them whole"), which flattens the subtext into a stated thesis right before the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and tightly focalized, matching the "heightened stillness" tone requirement perfectly. The shift from tactile observation to cosmic metaphor is handled smoothly within the POV's established lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and dense, but the required phrase "fractally precise" appears twice (once as "accuracy," once as "gradations"), creating a noticeable lexical loop. The phrasing "cipher of the cosmos" leans slightly purple, but the rhythm generally supports the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of the prompt elements. The concept of a blind artist painting invisible stars in a condemned tree library is fresh, specific, and executed with a clear, non-derivative vision.</comment>
