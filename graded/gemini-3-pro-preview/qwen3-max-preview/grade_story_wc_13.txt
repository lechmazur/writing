<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct ("midwife memory") and drives the narrative effectively. Interiority is well-rendered, though the personal stakes feel slightly more philosophical than visceral; the physical cost ("from her own pulse") lacks a dramatized consequence beyond general fatigue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident and a logical progression of beats leading to a decisive change (the bird becomes real). The climax—borrowing from the giant's dreams—is a strong escalation that resolves the central tension, though the "soft" reaction of the giant mitigates the sense of danger slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is inventive and integral to the plot; the acoustic canals and the giant's breathing provide specific, atmospheric constraints that shape the protagonist's actions. The sensory details ("moss-slicked," "iridescent throats") ground the fantastical elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conflict (racing against the giant's waking) provides coherent pressure, and the "chime" complication raises the stakes nicely. However, the cost of the magic (fatigue, clarity) feels somewhat abstract, and the resolution's lack of negative consequence for the giant's stirring softens the final impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and the non-linearity of time is woven consistently through the imagery and action without becoming preachy. The ending resonates well, positioning the art as an anchor against loss, offering a satisfying conceptual repricing of her work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently atmospheric, suiting the magical realism tone perfectly. The control of psychic distance is steady, keeping the reader anchored in the illustrator's perception throughout the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. At times, the figurative language becomes dense ("womb of resonance," "embryos in amniotic silence"), slightly clogging the pacing during high-tension beats, but the overall craft is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—a city suspended by a giant's nap where canals amplify extinct echoes—is highly original and vividly realized. The synthesis of natural history illustration with temporal magic feels fresh and distinctive.</comment>
