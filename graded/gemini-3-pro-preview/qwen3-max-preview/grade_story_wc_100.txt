<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's weariness and reverence are well-rendered, fitting the atmospheric tone. However, his agency is undercut by the solution arriving fully formed "in a dream," rather than through active problem-solving or a costly struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (distress to belonging), but the narrative arc relies on a convenient "dream" instruction to bridge the conflict and resolution. This bypasses the necessary "trial and error" phase of the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater library is realized with vivid, tactile specificity ("salt-crusted," "brine-stilled," "bloated spines"). The setting actively shapes the mood and the mechanics of the haunting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The internal pressure is established well through the "molars ache" resonance. However, the conflict lacks external friction or a moment of doubt; the path from recognition to resolution is linear and devoid of setbacks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shift from "rescue" to "release" and "belonging" provides a strong, unified thematic argument. The final image of the "cathedral of quiet endings" resonates effectively with the established premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistently atmospheric and distinct, suiting the gothic/aquatic genre. It occasionally leans into melodrama ("fractured like frozen lightning"), but maintains a cohesive mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A pervasive syntactic tic ("Not [X], but [Y]") appears over ten times, creating a repetitive, lecturing cadence that stalls momentum. This template structure dominates the prose at the expense of variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater undertaker utilizing a lighthouse lens for ghosts is imaginative and visually striking. It offers a fresh, specific synthesis of familiar gothic tropes.</comment>
