<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the internal conflict relies on diagnostic labels ("shadow work," "buried beneath pacifism") rather than purely dramatized struggle. The resolution with the shadow feels slightly too tidy and verbal ("You are my anchor"), reading more like therapy-speak than a character under high pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The drive lens is Causal, moving effectively from established routine to specific discovery (the photo) and action. Closure is distinct and earned (entering the gate), though the "shadow detachment" moment feels slightly rushed mechanically, functioning as a convenient lock-pick for the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "emotional gravity" attribute effectively turns the character's body into a part of the setting's physics, grounding the metaphysical premise. The ship's sentience and decay ("lullaby of rust") provide a strong, atmospheric backdrop that constrains the protagonist's movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake (reunion) is clear and scales well. The escalation (finding the frequency, the ship buckling) works, but the primary internal obstacle (the shadow) is resolved with relatively low friction—a quick acknowledgment rather than a prolonged struggle with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of integrating darkness to achieve wholeness is coherent and clearly developed. However, the explicit articulation of the lesson ("carry me like a wing") leans towards a moralizing summary, stating the subtext rather than letting the resonant image of the tear do the heavy lifting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is consistent and intimate, with a lyrical, elevated voice fitting the "last human" mythos. The personification of the ship adds a nice layer to the narrative voice, though the "shadow's" dialogue feels slightly distinct from the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("crystallized into light," "refracted not memory but possibility"), risking purple patches. The explicit naming of the psychological concept ("shadow work") within the narrative flow breaks the spell, reading more like an explanation than a story beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of "emotional gravity" is a fresh, specific synthesis of the prompt elements that elevates the standard "dimension hopping" trope. The "stitch" mechanic is handled with unique visual flair, transforming a standard magic system into something character-specific.</comment>
