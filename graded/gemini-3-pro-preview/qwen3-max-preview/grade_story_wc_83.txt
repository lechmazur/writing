<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific "calibrated desperation" offers a compelling, distinct lens on trauma that avoids passivity. Her motivation—mapping potential rather than vengeance—is strongly established and drives the decisive choice to leave the observatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal arc is efficient and logical within the story's sci-fi framework: simulation leads to coordinates, forcing a physical departure. The closure functions as a valid Decisive Change, abandoning safety for the unknown with clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "Cradle of Cold Eyes" provides a vivid, isolating environment that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. Sensory details like magnetized boots, the chilled glass, and the geode's violet filaments successfully ground the high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging meaning from grief—is externalized effectively through the machine's feedback and the resulting coordinates. The escalation is clean, moving from intellectual simulation to a high-stakes physical commitment to hunt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central concept of "unused potential" acting as a physical resource is executed with high conceptual integrity. The ending resonates deeply, reframing the grief not as a loss to be accepted but as a location to be visited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a "calibrated" clinical distance that matches the character. The register is persistently elevated, which suits the tone but occasionally creates a slight emotional distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose momentum is strong and density is high, though metaphors like "wound turning in its sleep" and "trauma-tuned nerves" occasionally verge on purple melodrama. The required phrase "intangibly tangible" feels slightly forced within the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone-strike survivor narrative with orbital metaphysical exploration is highly inventive. The premise of mapping "what-could-have-been" via quantum perturbation offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on grief.</comment>
