<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vey is distinct but lacks sufficient agency and internal friction in the present scene; the "heartbeat" constraint is descriptive rather than a driver of difficult choices. The interaction with Lira is frictionless, lacking the status dynamics or conflicting goals that create a "crucible" for character revelation. Vey's primary action—listing items—is backstory/setup, leaving the climax largely reactive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear "happy path" where the protagonist’s goal is achieved without meaningful resistance or cost. The closure relies on a "soft reset" (heartbeat returning, capsule fixing itself) and an explanation of the mechanics, rather than a reconfiguration of stakes that demands a trade-off. The ending feels structurally inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, vividly realizing the "numbers as textures" concept and the "emerald silo" atmosphere. The sensory details (grit, silk, chalk) effectively ground the surreal premise. The environment actively shapes the narrative logic, though the lack of physical resistance from the setting limits its dramatic role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; Lira and Vey have aligned goals, and the capsule opens with minimal effort, removing potential for tension. There are no reversals or moments where failure feels possible, resulting in low narrative pressure. The stakes remain abstract (understanding time) and are resolved through cooperation rather than the "meaningful tightening" required for high-band scoring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is evocative but heavily didactic, articulated explicitly by the letter ("Time isn’t broken"), then Lira, then Vey. This triple-statement constitutes a significant "Thematic Echo" flaw, replacing subtext with direct instruction to the reader. The resonance is flattened by this over-explanation rather than emerging organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "garage sale of the apocalypse" tone. The distinction between the narrator's voice and the item descriptions is handled well. However, the dialogue occasionally slips into unnatural, aphoristic speeches that mirror the narration too closely.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and flows well, but leans on standard "poetic" structures (abstract noun + of + abstract noun lists like "grit of joy, silk of sorrow") that verge on sentimentality. While technically clean, the reliance on metaphors like "ribs expand" and "ghosts of gestures" creates a density that sometimes obscures the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central conceit—selling temporal anxieties via garage sale listings—is highly inventive and elevates the "magical artifact" premise. While the "healing a broken timeline" arc is familiar, the specific texture-based magic system and the "Hollow Net" offer a fresh, distinct flavor that stands out.</comment>
