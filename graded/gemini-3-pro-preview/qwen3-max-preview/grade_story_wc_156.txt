<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elira is clearly defined by her occupation and competence, and the "un-fixing" arc provides a functional internal trajectory. However, her internal state is often delivered through abstract summary ("weightless terror," "surrender") rather than dramatized reaction, and the lack of difficult on-page choices limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path with a distinct "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the protagonist and world are altered. The causality is somewhat dreamlike/fable-based ("ricochet of intention"), which fits the tone but reduces mechanical solidity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is excellent—vivid, specific, and functionally integrated into the plot mechanics (requiring reflection). The setting actively constrains the protagonist's approach and shapes the imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily abstract (curiosity, perception) and the external resistance is low; the garden yields quickly to the protagonist's first alternate attempt. The emotional cost ("terror") is experienced as a reaction to success rather than a pressure forcing a difficult decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The themes of resonance, surrender, and "un-fixing" cohere well with the setting and action. The ending leans slightly into explicit thesis statements ("Curiosity, not certainty, now guided her steps"), which blunts the subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its poetic register. However, it suffers from a distracting rhythmic monotony due to the overuse of a specific syntactic structure (see Q7), which makes the narration feel formulaic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is marred by a severe "Template Cadence" artifact: the "not [X], but [Y]" sentence structure is used over 14 times in ~600 words. This incessant repetition creates a droning, predictable rhythm that undermines the otherwise vivid vocabulary and imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of sonic mural restoration is fresh and imaginative. The execution feels like a modern myth or fable, synthesizing the prompt elements into a coherent, if slightly stylized, whole.</comment>
