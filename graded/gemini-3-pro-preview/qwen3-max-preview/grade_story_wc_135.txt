<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elira functions as a thematic vehicle rather than a character; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct voice, or genuine struggle. Her motivation is explicitly stated in summary ("to compile fragments") rather than revealed through high-stakes choices, and she faces no friction from the community or herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on broad summary spanning years ("Each morning," "Years later") rather than dramatizing a specific scene with a concrete "now." This violates the short-story scope by failing to ground the reader in a singular, unfolding event with causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but static, relying on "adjective-noun" pairings ("bruised sky," "salt-warped ledgers") that serve as decoration rather than constraint. The harbor provides a backdrop but does not force specific tactical choices or impede the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the fisherfolk trust her immediately, the council agrees without debate, and the "absences" are easily mapped. The lack of opposition—internal, interpersonal, or environmental—means the stakes are declared but never tested on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story explains its own meaning through didactic assertions ("not to fill silence, but to honor its shape") rather than allowing subtext to emerge from action. The ending sermonizes about the nature of grief instead of trusting the reader to infer resonance from the ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but distant and fable-like, preventing emotional intimacy. It relies on omniscient summary ("They sensed, without understanding") rather than grounding the experience in Elira's immediate perception and sensory reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high metaphorical density and "purple" overwriting ("forgotten prayers," "tide-silt in estuaries") that slows momentum. Repeated sentence structures and abstract phrasing create a barrier to visualization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the core concept of "mapping absence" is poetic, the execution as a conflict-free fable feels generic and safe. The lack of specific, grounded detail turns a potentially fresh idea into a predictable allegory.</comment>
