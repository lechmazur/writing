<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct and competent, and his motivation (witnessing) is clear. However, he lacks internal conflict or flaws; his interaction with the ghost is smooth and safe, resulting in a character who feels slightly idealized rather than tested by the pressure of the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from investigation to discovery to acknowledgment. The closure (acknowledging the ghost) lands firmly under the established lens. The linear progression works, though the "weightless burden" cost is abstract and thematic rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, utilizing specific sensory details like the "pure tone" of the water drop and the "smell of popcorn." The integration of the horologist’s tool as a means to interact with the environment adds a layer of unique, tactile specificity that grounds the ghostly elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tension escalates appropriately through discovery, culminating in the manifestation of the ghost. However, the stakes remain low and largely internal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, making the conflict feel more like a procedural unraveling than a struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing the neglected is coherent and resonates through the imagery of dust and silence. The connection to his daughter adds emotional weight, and the ending recontextualizes the abandoned space effectively as a place of vigil rather than just ruin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, melancholic, and observant, fitting the protagonist's role. It occasionally veers into slightly purple prose ("silences where laughter used to live"), but maintains a strong, atmospheric control throughout the shard.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>There are moments of excellent sensory precision ("vibrated in his molars"), but the prose suffers from occasional heavy-handedness ("Analysis was his liturgy") and clunky phrasing ("skillfully observant eyes"). Some descriptions rely on familiar tropes (popcorn/sawdust) rather than fresh observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of an elevator technician using watchmaking tools to track ghosts via dust patterns is a fresh, ingenious combination. While the "ghost with unfinished business" trope is standard, the specific method of engagement and the protagonist's non-fearful stance elevate the execution.</comment>
