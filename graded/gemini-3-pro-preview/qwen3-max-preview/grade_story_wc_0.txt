<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but executed through summary rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional pivot ("she wept then... kindled humility") relies on diagnostic labeling rather than embodied reaction to immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story violates the single-scene/two-shard scope default, summarizing "years" of action rather than dramatizing a specific crisis. It reads like a synopsis or montage, lacking the immediate causal pressure required for a short story in this band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details ("wet rot," "ozone," "fractal spirals") that effectively ground the abstract intellectual concepts in a tangible place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Conflict is purely conceptual and lacks immediate stakes; external opposition ("colleagues") is summarized off-page, and the internal resolution occurs through passive time jumps rather than an acute, on-page choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated by the protagonist ("Decay as Iterative Refinement") and the narrator ("poetry... was just physics"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. This heavy-handedness flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately cerebral, fitting the character. However, the synoptic mode leads to a repetitive "She [verb]" sentence cadence that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense ("drowned soil," "creak like a ship hull"), though the "Poetry... physics" line reads as a platitude. The line-level craft is competent but hamstrung by the summary structure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-energy astrophysics and biological decay is novel and distinct. The premise offers a fresh intellectual angle, even if the narrative execution relies too heavily on abstraction.</comment>
