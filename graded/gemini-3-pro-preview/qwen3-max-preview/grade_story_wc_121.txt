<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by abstract labels rather than embodied traits; her specific memories are listed rather than felt. The climax relies on diagnostic therapy-speak ("I ran because I thought I was unworthy") rather than dramatized emotional cost, triggering the penalty for label-speak in peak beats. Internal conflict is resolved through declaration rather than a difficult, value-laden choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is legible and structurally sound, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist integrates her fractured selves. However, the narrative progression feels mechanical, driven by a linear sequence of generated encounters rather than escalating causal pressure. The "procedural" framing risks making the plot feel like a tour rather than a struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, with vivid, high-contrast imagery like "phosphorescent residue" and "suspended stars" effectively grounding the surreal concept. The setting actively charges the final beat as the viaduct trembles and the tablet blooms. However, the generated "childhood room" feels less distinct than the frame setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the stakes of "recursion" vs. "integration" are clear, they remain abstract and lack immediate, visceral cost. The resolution comes too easily; the protagonist speaks her fears and the obstacles immediately yield, missing the friction of a "felt cost" required for higher bands. The external environment reacts, but the internal price is stated rather than paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its themes ("To conquer it meant not to escape, but to integrate") and articulates its thesis in the final dialogue ("I am the branching"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for subtext. This didactic approach flattens the narrative resonance, reducing the ending to a summary of the prompt's concepts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently interpreting the metaphysics for the reader ("where cause hadn’t yet kissed effect") instead of trusting the action. The distance is somewhat remote, keeping the reader observing the concept rather than inhabiting the character's experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A severe, pervasive rhetorical scaffold loop ("Not X, but Y") dominates the prose, appearing over fifteen times (e.g., "not flying—unclaimed," "not sound, but fracture," "not to consume, but to merge"). This relentless template cadence destroys rhythmic variety and creates a monotonous, droning texture that distracts significantly from the content.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "procedural generation" with the "confronting shadow selves" trope is functional but yields a predictable outcome. The specific mechanics of the tablet offer some freshness, but the emotional arc—admitting fear to dissolve ghosts—is a familiar convention in this genre without a novel twist.</comment>
