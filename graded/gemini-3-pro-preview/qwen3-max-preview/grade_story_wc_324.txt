<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a competent professional but lacks internal conflict or a distinctive personality beyond her role. Her trait of being "persistently curious" is stated in exposition rather than demonstrated through unique choices that complicate the plot. She faces no significant personal cost or difficult trade-off, acting more as a plot device than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path with solid orientation and legible closure. However, the resolution feels structurally symmetric and low-friction; the problem is introduced and solved with a perfect tool and speech, lacking a "micro turn" or complication that forces the protagonist to adapt. The cost of "kneeling in the damp" is asserted rather than dramatized as a significant price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using sensory details like "wet stone" and "wilted roses" to ground the supernatural elements. While some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("veined with forgotten histories"), the environment successfully creates a coherent mood that supports the narrative's melancholic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist encounters a distressed spirit and resolves the situation immediately with a functioning device and a calming speech. There is no escalation of stakes, failure of tactics, or resistance from the antagonist (the grief/ghost), resulting in a "fix-it" beat that lacks dramatic tension or earned victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in both dialogue ("love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency") and narration ("quiet, incidental heroism"). This direct stating of the thesis reduces subtextual resonance, turning the ending into a lesson rather than an earned emotional experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending technical terminology with lyrical description. However, the tone occasionally slips into melodrama ("vulnerable voice, fractured by grief") that filters the reader's experience through diagnostic labels rather than raw observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished but overwrought, relying heavily on adjectives and similes ("bruised twilight," "surrendered hands," "liquid gold puddles"). Diagnostic labeling ("fractured by grief") and template sentence structures in action beats dampen the immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of using a modified hearing aid to tune into emotional frequencies offers a fresh mechanical twist on the "medium" trope. However, the core arc of comforting a lost ghost child is familiar, and the "contact tracer" metaphor feels slightly derivative of recent global events without deeply transforming the premise.</comment>
