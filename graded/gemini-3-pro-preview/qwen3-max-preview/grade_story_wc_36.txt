<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "harvest insights" is clear, but her interiority feels clinical and lacks the contradictory impulses required for higher bands; the struggle against the temptation to fix the weave is stated rather than felt. The coda ("Years later...") flattens the character into a sage figure rather than a person living a specific moment of cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure is linear and coherent, but the middle section lacks resistance; the ritual and exploration proceed with perfect efficiency, devoid of complications that would test the plan. The shift to a summary explanation at the end ("Years later") diffuses the immediate tension of the scene and explains the closure rather than letting the final image carry the weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "Thunder-echo Range" is rendered with strong sensory detail ("driftwood bleached silver," "shadows pooled"), anchoring the scene effectively. However, the magical "between-place" relies on somewhat abstract descriptors ("gradient of forgotten hues," "gravity bent politely") that lack the visceral specificity of the canyon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tension is low because the protagonist encounters no on-page obstacles; the wind does not disturb the markers, the flute plays perfectly, and the realms offer their lessons without threat. The stakes remain theoretical—a "never again" verdict from the past—rather than an immediate, active pressure challenging her actions in the present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of honoring failure is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness in the final paragraphs ("Let the failures be honored," "Some doors stay open..."). This triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, as the character articulates the story's thesis in a prompt-like summary that replaces dramatic resonance with instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a mythic tone. It occasionally slips into "writerly" distancing effects or slightly purple phrasing ("ink bleeding into parchment," "brittle as old vows") that prioritizes sound over immediate character perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is competent but relies on several simile clichés ("silence fell like snow," "shadows pooled like spilled ink," "thin as spider silk"). "Avalanchingly" is an awkward adverbial construction that stumbles the opening rhythm, and the sentence structures in the middle section become somewhat repetitive ("She rose," "She lifted," "She stepped").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of performing an autopsy on dead magical realms to learn from their collapse is a fresh and compelling angle. However, the execution falls into a standard fable structure, and the lessons learned (ambition, timidity, rigidity) feel like Goldilocks archetypes rather than specific, messy human failures.</comment>
