<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is consistently drawn with vivid sensory details, but she lacks internal friction or significant flaws. Her journey is smooth—she identifies a need and fulfills it with competence—which lowers the dramatic stakes of her final release. The transition from "refusing to fade" to accepting the "final bow" feels slightly unearned by the on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (transformation into the tree) is a legible Decisive Change. However, the progression is linear and low-resistance; the magical intervention works exactly as intended without complication, making the plot feel more like a procedural vignette than a pressured story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering a lush, specific, and atmospheric backdrop that integrates well with the ghost’s synesthesia. The "orchard concealed within the maze" and the "timelines like eggshells" provide a strong, grounding physical logic for the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conflict is the weakest element; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The "brink of despair" is abstract and easily remedied by her intervention, resulting in a lack of narrative torque or escalating pressure prior to the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into possibility is resonant and clearly articulated through the orchard imagery. While it leans slightly toward sentimentality ("lure possibility from the brink"), the final image of the sapling successfully anchors the concept in a concrete object.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and nostalgic tone that suits the subject matter. The synesthetic descriptions are handled with confidence, creating a unified perceptual signature for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with high adjective density and abstract metaphors ("curtain calls that intertwined with the rustling leaves"). There is a repetitive syntactic scaffolding in the resolution ("The woman... The teenager... The old man...") that flattens the rhythm of the epilogue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stage ghost, synesthesia, and a timeline-shifting orchard offers a fresh take on the redemption/passing-on trope. The imagery of the coin-turned-sapling is an imaginative and specific reconfiguration of the prompt elements.</comment>
