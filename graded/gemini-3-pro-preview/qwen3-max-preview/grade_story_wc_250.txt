<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is stoic and competent but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses on the page. The "memory of the boy" serves as backstory rather than generating active present-tense conflict or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, but momentum stalls for expository blocks ("Her method?", "This was her action") that explain the magic system instead of dramatizing it. Closure lands as a functional Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is high, particularly with the dental mirror and iron grates acting as micro-settings that constrain the magic. The sensory details effectively ground the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative pressure is low; the "darkness" is a passive observer, and the guardian faces no risk of failure or significant cost during the ritual. The success feels inevitable from the start.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of reframing tragedy is consistent but is explicitly stated via narration ("teach darkness the value of stars") rather than emerging purely through subtext and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically consistent and fits the mythic mode, though the narrator occasionally slips into explanatory summary that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is evocative ("drowned sapphire") but occasionally overwrought with adjective density. The prompt phrase "spiralingly calm" appears twice, creating a repetitive artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The specific mechanics of the magic—using a dental mirror and shutter grates to weave light-glyphs—are highly inventive and freshly transform the "ghost guide" trope.</comment>
