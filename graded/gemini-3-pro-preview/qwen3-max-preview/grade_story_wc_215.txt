<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the story's theme than a living character with internal friction. While her "mute eloquence" is consistent, she lacks the contradictory impulses required for depth; her adherence to the covenant feels absolute and static rather than struggled for. The prompt's required attribute "astonished" appears as a label but is immediately contradicted by her "tranquil" and "unblinking" demeanor, creating a characterization disconnect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on habitual summary ("Each morning, she knelt," "At dusk," "When storms came") rather than a specific, unfolding scene, which distances the reader from immediate causality. The climax ("And when, one twilight") arrives very late and happens *to* the protagonist via the ghost's action, rather than being driven by her own agency, resulting in a passive resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and tightly controlled, with the "sun-bleached" ruin and "stained glass box" anchoring the visual field effectively. The sensory details (" ash," "cobalt," "grit") successfully create a cohesive, oppressive texture, though the reliance on visual adjectives sometimes crowds out other sensory modes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract and thematic ("oblivion," "silence") rather than urgent or visceral on the page. Because the protagonist's stance is one of static endurance from the first line, there is little escalation or pressure testing her resolve; the ending confirms the status quo rather than forcing a new cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of bearing witness to "unspoken words" is coherent and resonates through the imagery of the box and the ghosts. However, the text tends to explicate the theme ("honor the architecture of silence") rather than trusting the subtext to carry it, reducing the potential for ambiguity and reader discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and consistent, fitting the mythic tone of the setting. It occasionally risks monotony due to a reliance on similar sentence structures (negation-affirmation patterns like "not for threats... but for echoes") and a uniformly high, serious register that allows little breathing room.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from significant overwriting and "purple" artifacts ("sky bleached of mercy," "scribe of sighs," "wind dared whisper"). This density of figurative language slows momentum and draws attention to the author's hand rather than the scene, violating the economy bias expected in high-end literary fiction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping imagery with a post-apocalyptic ghost story is fresh and creates a unique aesthetic. The concept of the "covenant of silence" offers a non-obvious angle on the survivor trope, though the execution leans heavily on familiar atmospheric beats.</comment>
