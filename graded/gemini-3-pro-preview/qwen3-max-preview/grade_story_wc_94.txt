<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The poet’s internal state is rendered with high specificity, and the contradiction of "furiously tranquil" is enacted well through the ritual. The choice to maintain the vigil rather than succumb to the impulse of the letter demonstrates agency. The character feels distinct, though the "censorship" backstory relies heavily on summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, using the timer to build pressure toward a quiet but decisive moment of Earned Stasis (refusal to open). The closure is legible and resonant. A slight reliance on internal summary over dramatized action keeps it from the highest bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and mirrored effectively against the internal landscape ("clouds below churned like ink"). The sensory details—cold brass, ticking, lightning—anchor the abstract emotions in concrete reality. The atmosphere is cohesive and compelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (emotional survival/memory), but the conflict remains largely internal and static. The external pressure (storm) parallels the internal state but doesn't force the poet's hand, leaving the tension somewhat reliant on the narrator's assertions of importance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The themes of censorship and memory are strong, but the story tends to explicate them ("To rarefy was to refine pain...") rather than letting them emerge solely from action. The ending resonates, but the path there feels occasionally didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and suitably elevated for the subject matter. The close third-person perspective manages the transition between observation and memory smoothly. The lyric register is maintained without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density ("metronome to memory," "cartography of wounds," "oracle of ink") that occasionally slows momentum. The required phrase "storm-kissed wonder" feels slightly ornamental. Rhythm is good, but adjectival heaviness drags slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a censored poet, a darkroom timer, and an observatory creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The "bus timetable" concealment method is a standout detail that grounds the high-concept premise in gritty reality.</comment>
