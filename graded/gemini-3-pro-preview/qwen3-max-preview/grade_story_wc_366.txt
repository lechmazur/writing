<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is deeply rooted in grief and service, creating a compelling internal landscape. Elias's reticence and ritualistic behavior are consistent and well-dramatized. The shift from "hollowing" to "luminescent" feels earned by his character arc, even if the external trigger is slight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A major continuity error disrupts causality: Elias places the sea glass on the sill, yet moments later it is pulsing in his pocket without a retrieval beat. Additionally, the lamp's restoration relies on ghostly coincidence rather than protagonist agency, weakening the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, with specific details like the stone cairn codes grounding the scene. However, descriptors like "velvet dark" and "bruised twilight" lean toward generic literary clichés, slightly diminishing the vividness of the locale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the internal stakes of managing grief are clear, the physical cost is undermined by the object continuity error—it is unclear if he sacrificed his anchor or kept it. The external conflict resolves via supernatural coincidence rather than a direct result of his actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of connection through silence is woven effectively through the letters, stones, and light. The final image resonates with the established motifs, though the "luminescent ache" is a slightly heavy-handed articulation of the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally controlled and suitably melancholic. However, the meta-commentary "Not metaphorically. Not symbolically." disrupts immersion, momentarily breaking the psychic distance to address the reader directly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Polished sentence rhythm is marred by the significant continuity flaw regarding the sea glass's location. Phrasing occasionally slips into well-worn grooves ("echoing like heartbeats," "velvet dark"), reducing the freshness of the prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central trope of a grieving lighthouse keeper is familiar, but the specific invention of the stone-stacking code adds a fresh layer of ingenuity. The synthesis of the letter chain and the haunted light creates a distinct emotional texture.</comment>
