<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elira is a highly competent protagonist, but she lacks internal contradiction or a flaw that complicates her success. She enters the crisis prepared and succeeds without a moment of doubt, personal cost, or psychological evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is linear and clear, but the climax relies on a pre-built "jury-rigged box" rather than in-scene improvisation. This convenient solution dissolves the tension too easily, lacking the "felt cost" required for high-band closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like "yellowed astronomical charts" and the subsonic vibrations rattling molars effectively ground the scene. The setting serves as a functional tool for the protagonist, though it does not significantly constrain her choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the stakes (social fracture) are high, the on-page conflict is low-friction; the antagonist retreats immediately upon resistance. The protagonist faces no difficult tradeoffs, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of counter-frequency as healing is coherent and resonant. However, the post-climax explanation of "the physics of hope" leans into didactic "telling" rather than letting the image speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a "noir-science" atmosphere that suits the protagonist's weary expertise. The perspective remains stable, though it occasionally slips into explaining concepts to the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong images ("peeling skin from an apple"). However, artifacts like direct address ("Think of it as...") and summarized reactions ("One freshman posted...") flatten the immediacy of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a radio operator combating a viral signal is a familiar trope executed competently here. The story fulfills the premise efficiently but lacks a distinct, subversive twist to elevate it beyond standard genre fare.</comment>
