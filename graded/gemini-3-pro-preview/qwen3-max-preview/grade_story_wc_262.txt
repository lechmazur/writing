<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal mirroring—her own unsent letters—effectively anchors the external quest, creating a cohesive emotional arc. Her final choice to "release" the letters is a clear, motivated action that resolves her internal tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean linear structure with a decisive closure act. However, the discovery of the letters in a hidden compartment relies on convenient tropes rather than causal pressure, slightly weakening the plot's inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout strength; sensory details like "ozone and old velvet" and "wax the color of dried roses" ground the magical realism. The projection booth feels lived-in and specifically constrains the discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Internal pressure is legible, with the protagonist physically feeling the "weight" of the grief. However, the external obstacles are minimal, and the cost of the final action (mailing the letters) is relatively low-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The explicit moral on the marquee ("LOVE NEVER ENDS...") severely undercuts the subtext, reducing a resonant theme to a literal billboard. This violation of the "show, don't tell" principle flattens the ending's impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the nostalgic subject matter. The control of psychic distance allows the reader to share the gazer's intimate perceptions without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, with the "hushed thunder" motif effectively framing the piece. However, reliance on stock imagery like "origami birds" and "satin gloves" leans into cliché, preventing the language from feeling truly fresh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise of finding undelivered love letters via psychometry is executed competently but remains a very familiar trope. The story follows a predictable sentimental formula without subverting expectations or offering a novel twist.</comment>
