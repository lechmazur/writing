<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the protagonist functions as a flawless expert without internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal stakes; the lack of visible struggle or cost limits character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (the released spirit), but the linear progression lacks significant friction or a decisive tightening moment before the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the specific tactile details of the "melted snow globe" and the "glacier shrine" ground the ethereal concept and constrain the ritual effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tension is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure; the resolution is achieved through competent procedure rather than a high-stakes choice or paid price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging connection from tragedy is cohesive and resonant, anchored by the central metaphor, though the "ripples" ending leans slightly toward sentimental resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric voice matches the subject matter well; the shift to omniscient dream-shards at the closure is structurally sound, though the protagonist's interiority remains somewhat distant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high-quality imagery ("slumped, dreamlike smear"), though occasional expository scaffolding ("that’s what the ghost whisperer calls them") creates minor drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of analyzing "dream cameos" to solve hauntings is a fresh, creative synthesis, even if the ritualistic resolution follows a more familiar pattern.</comment>
