<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation is clear and drives the narrative, particularly the choice to fly deeper into danger rather than flee the returning gravity. The internal shift from pilot to "echo" is well-staged via the interaction with the relic, though the epiphany feels slightly more thematic than character-rooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is tight, utilizing the "gravity inversion" effectively as a ticking clock that pressures the climax. The closure (planting the arrow) creates a distinct, legible change in the world state and the protagonist's outlook, satisfying the drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot mechanics; the dew trails acting as compass needles and the gravity tide creating the window of action are brilliant. The environment constrains the protagonist's choices and charges the final image with resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, anchored by the environmental threat of the returning gravity. The escalation works well through the time limit and the dash to the Grandmother tree, though the antagonist is purely situational; the "cost" is risk rather than a paid price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but suffers from explicit moralizing near the end ("resilience is not grown — it is recalled"). This direct statement flattens the subtext, explaining the meaning to the reader rather than letting the dramatic action carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the solarpunk aesthetic. The POV remains close and perceptual, effectively conveying the sensory experience of the bio-resonance without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid ("mist pooled like liquid memory"), but the prose relies heavily on a repetitive negation structure ("Not X, but Y"; "Not a weapon... a seed"; "Not to fix... to listen"). This rhetorical tic appears frequently enough to become a noticeable artifact that stalls rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of an orchard setting with gravity inversion and ancient "memory seeds" is fresh and imaginative. The "arrow as planter" trope inversion is executed with specific, grounded detail that feels distinct.</comment>
