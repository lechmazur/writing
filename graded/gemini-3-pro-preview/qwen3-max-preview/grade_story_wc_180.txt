<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is vividly realized through her specific tools (honey, spoon) and physical traits (quartz eyes). Her reaction to the hurtful vow—choosing patience over anger—dramatizes her motivation effectively. The daughter's presence is felt strongly through the props, creating a tangible relationship dynamic even in her absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving from the setup of the magical orchard to the specific climax of retrieving the hostile vow. The closure (the green ribbon) serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration, offering earned hope without unearned total reconciliation. The dream sequence transitioning to physical evidence is a slight causal softener, but fits the fable logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; "deciduous vows" falling like fruit physically constrains the action, requiring ladders and tools. The cathedral-orchard fusion is not just backdrop but the engine of the plot, determining how the character interacts with the abstract concept of broken promises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes are intimate and clearly escalated when the mender discovers the specific, hurtful vow ("I will never understand you"). This raises the pressure from general maintenance to a personal confrontation with rejection. The resolution feels earned by her persistence, though the daughter's off-page return relies slightly on coincidence/magic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central metaphor of repairing vows is powerful and integrated well into the action. However, the final paragraph explicitly sermonizes ("But because wisdom, like orchards, grows best..."), converting subtext into text. This moralizing undercut the resonance of the otherwise subtle green ribbon image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent fairy-tale register that supports the magical realism elements. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to the mender's perceptions while allowing the atmospheric descriptions to breathe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and lyrical ("rafters now laced with apple boughs"). There are moments of overwriting where metaphors explain the emotion too directly ("sticky with unresolved emotion," "curled inward like a shy confession"). The phrase "forgotten bag's contents" appears twice and feels slightly stiff/forced.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a repairman archetype with an orchard of tangible vows is fresh and engaging. While "tangible memories" is a known trope, the specific execution with the quartz-eye mender and her bureaucratic backstory adds a unique, distinct flavor.</comment>
