<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elira is a competent focalizer, but her "fractured cognition" functions more as a stated superpower than a constraint or source of internal conflict. Her choices are linear and purely tactical; the "cost" of searing memory reads as an expositional reward rather than a felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path (Lens: Causal), but the discovery of Fragment Delta feels overly convenient for the gravity mechanic. Closure is achieved through simple task completion ("Earned Stasis") without a distinct conceptual or emotional reweighting of the initial stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The inverted gravity setting is vivid and functionally constrains movement, forcing the protagonist to navigate the underside of the bridge. The sensory details ("falling water that now rose") effectively ground the fantastical physics in the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; while the "sky's sigh" provides a clock, the lack of active antagonism or difficult trade-offs keeps tension low. The protagonist faces environmental puzzles but no true jeopardy or moral calculus that forces a painful choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of "seeding vigilance" is stated explicitly rather than emerging through subtext. The ending didacticism ("vigilance cannot be enforced... it must be seeded") flattens resonance by summarizing the moral instead of letting the imagery speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple descriptors that distance the reader from the immediate action. The perspective stays firmly with Elira, though the elevated register sometimes feels more like authorial poetry than character perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and descriptive, with some striking images ("bat made of parchment"). However, the density of adjectives and "clandestinely luminous" repetition (forced by the prompt) creates a slight drag on momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of "marginalia as map" is clever, and the gravity inversion adds a fresh layer to a standard dungeon-delve structure. However, the execution remains safely within genre conventions without subverting expectations or deepening the trope.</comment>
