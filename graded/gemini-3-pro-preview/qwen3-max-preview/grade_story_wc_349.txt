<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The protagonist is clearly defined by her role and backstory ("daughter, debtor, deserter"), fitting the fable-like mode. However, her internal landscape is largely static; the "unwriting" motivation serves as a premise rather than a source of active, agonizing struggle in the scene. The interaction with patrons feels rehearsed rather than pressurized, lacking the visceral contradictory impulses that drive high-band characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear Accumulative structure, effectively using the transactions to demonstrate the "distribution of weight." Orientation is handled quickly, and the closure—a sense of lightness gained through the ritual—lands clearly. However, the progression is predictable, lacking a sharp causal turn or complication that would test the vendor's resolve or method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, successfully establishing a surreal, ethereal atmosphere ("glass orchard," "clouds," "ozone") that anchors the metaphysical commerce. While evocative, the description occasionally leans on stock fantasy imagery ("pearlescent gates," "swirling sea") that borders on ornamental. The environment integrates well with the plot, specifically the glass countertop used for the ritual incisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is the story's weakest element; there is virtually no resistance from the patrons or the environment. The vendor’s goal to "unwrite herself" faces no obstruction, turning the scene into a smooth demonstration of her trade rather than a dramatic test. The accumulation of sales provides a rhythmic progression, but without distinct escalation or stakes that feel imperiled, the narrative tension remains low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "quantifying absence" is intellectually engaging but delivered with heavy-handed exposition in dialogue ("I sell the method," "Choose your emptiness"). The story relies on explaining its thesis rather than letting it emerge organically from subtext or action. The ledger entry provides a nice specific grounding, but the overall delivery feels didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elevated tone that suits the fable genre. The stylist's control is evident, though the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tectonic plates of narrative") that distances the reader. The transition between narration and dialogue is smooth, though the characters speak with a similar high-concept vocabulary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished but suffers from high metaphor density ("ledger bound in mist," "stylus of frozen breath") that clogs the narrative flow. The phrase "fingers, mindfully scattered" is a distracting physical image, likely a forced prompt inclusion that breaks anatomical logic. While rhythmically competent, the prose prioritizes poetic effect over clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "shop that sells abstract concepts" is a familiar trope, though the specific twist of "quantifying absence" rather than selling items adds a fresh intellectual layer. The execution remains safely within genre conventions without subverting them or taking significant narrative risks. The result is a pleasant but standard iteration of the magical vendor archetype.</comment>
