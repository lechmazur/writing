<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist functions primarily as a passive observer, lacking distinct contradictory impulses or internal friction until the brief hesitation near the end. While the "softened" state at closure suggests an arc, the emotional cost is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices or resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent accumulative logic, effectively using the origami swan as a threshold device to structure the journey. However, the closure relies on a declared internal shift ("softened like wax") rather than a demonstrated change in behavior or circumstance, lowering the sense of consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is a strength, with details like "ink-dried roses," "beetle wings," and "scent of cinnamon" grounding the fantastical setting. These sensory anchors successfully establish the library's physical reality, though the reliance on abstract descriptors occasionally dilutes the immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Narrative pressure is minimal, as the keeper faces no external opposition and the internal burden of "witnessing" is theoretical rather than felt. The escalation through the vision is observational, lacking a moment where the character's agency is tested against a significant cost or risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of accepting impermanence is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing ("knowing that to witness... was the rarest form of love"). This reliance on summary statements to convey meaning robs the ending of subtextual resonance and feels didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The elevated, lyrical voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone, maintaining a steady rhythm throughout. However, the register occasionally creates excessive distance, prioritizing poetic cadence over the character's immediate, embodied experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose suffers from metaphor density, with abstract figurations ("living membrane," "frayed edges of memory") often cluttering the sentence level. This overwriting slows momentum and obscures the action, favoring decorative description over narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of the origami swan serving as a dimensional map is an ingenious, specific image that elevates the piece above standard "timeless archivist" tropes. The rest of the setup, however, adheres closely to familiar genre conventions of ruined sanctuaries and passive watching.</comment>
