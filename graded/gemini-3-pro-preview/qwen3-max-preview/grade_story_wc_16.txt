<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent vessel for the concept, and her motivation ("restore trust") is clear. However, the trait "carefully reckless" is asserted via exposition rather than dramatized through a risky choice with visible cost, and the internal conflict remains relatively static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The structure is sound and the concept of "musical legalism" drives the plot logic effectively. The resolution, however, feels linear; the choir succeeds on the first attempt without a complication or pivot, making the victory feel slightly unearned despite the theoretical stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and active; the archive functions as a participant (walls exhaling, dust spiraling) rather than just a backdrop. The glass ink well serves as an excellent anchor for the setting's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Global stakes are well-defined, but the immediate pressure is dampened by weak opposition; the curator offers only token resistance. The climax lacks a moment of tangible near-failure to validate the "shattering truth" danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of semantic resonance as social contract is integrated beautifully into the magic system. The ending image of the prism reflects the multifaceted nature of rebuilt trust with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident and appropriately elevated for the "arcane" subject matter, maintaining a consistent tone. It successfully balances academic linguistic terms with the mystical elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose has good rhythm and polish ("brick by broken brick"), though it relies on some stock imagery in emotional beats (tears streaking cheeks, hearts pounding louder than footfalls). Adjectival density occasionally slows the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics, law, and music is fresh and handled with specific detail (syntax as oath). It elevates the "magic song" trope into a structural commentary on society.</comment>
