<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict (grimness vs. optimism) is well-dramatized through the specific action of the proofs and the reaction to the staircase. The shift from regret to integration at the closure is an earned psychological change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, moving from endurance to active rupture to reconfiguration. The closure (die vanishing, internal texture captured) is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that pays off the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The surreal atmosphere is established quickly with "illusion wrapped in geometry." While the staircase itself is somewhat abstract, the sensory details of the flashback (ozone, cheap perfume) ground the emotion effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates consistently through the climb and the carving of proofs. The stakes are effectively internalized, and the cost of the rupture—the loss of the physical die—is a felt price for the insight gained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of probability and the texture of "what if" resonates well. The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a complex acceptance of the unlived path, fitting the "grim optimist" persona.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and elevated ("marrow-deep certainty"). However, the forced insertion of the prompt phrase "balancedly daring" results in ungrammatical syntax that briefly disrupts the voice's authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm ("metronome of regret"), but suffers from awkward phrasing to accommodate the prompt ("moved balancedly daring" is jarring). Some descriptions border on purple ("scream in the shape of absence").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Using mathematical proofs to rupture a metaphysical space is a creative approach to the infinite staircase trope. The resolution—integrating the reflection rather than escaping—adds a fresh emotional layer.</comment>
