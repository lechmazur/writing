<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clearly established in backstory ("visceral"), but she faces no on-page resistance or contradictory impulses. Her competence is absolute, leading to a linear path without the "crucible" of choice or failure required for higher bands. The emotional climax feels performed rather than earned through struggle or decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing (silence as vessel) at closure under an Accumulative lens. However, the progression is frictionless; the protagonist sets up equipment and succeeds immediately without complication. The lack of "felt cost" or meaningful obstacles makes the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric detail is vivid and integral, transforming the setting (henge, rain, shadow) into an active participant in the reveal. The sensory environment effectively constraints the protagonist's method and shapes the pacing of the discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and atmospheric, lacking external pressure or a moment where the outcome is in doubt. The escalation is observational rather than dramatic; the protagonist witnesses rather than wrestles, resulting in low tension throughout the beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory and presence is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("silence... was not void but vessel") rather than subtext. The final paragraph relies on a summary of the moral ("some truths are not uncovered but remembered"), triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent but overly reliant on a specific rhetorical structure (negation-affirmation) that creates a didactic tone. This repetitive cadence distances the reader and gives the narration a lecturing quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>A severe syntactic tic ("not X but Y") appears over fifteen times, creating a monotonous, algorithmic rhythm that distracts from the imagery. This template cadence dominates the prose, reducing the impact of otherwise evocative descriptions and stifling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "whispered chapel" reconstructed through the shadow-patterns of ancient stones in time-lapse footage is ingenious and fresh. This specific, non-obvious synthesis of technology and myth elevates the piece significantly despite execution flaws.</comment>
