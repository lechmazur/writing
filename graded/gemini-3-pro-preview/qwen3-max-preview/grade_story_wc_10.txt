<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist is competent and distinctly motivated ("not to mourn, but to rectify"), with a clear internal landscape. However, she lacks an on-page crucible; her success with the method feels inevitable, and she faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices that test her resolve. She functions more as a vessel for the concept than a character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The structure is a linear Accumulative procedural: arrival, explanation of method, testing, and successful expansion. While the closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (silence recontextualized as music), the middle section relies heavily on expository summary of the "heat-mapping" science rather than dramatized struggle, reducing narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "winterglass" physics and "brittle geometry" actively constrain the protagonist's tools (vibration over sound). The sensory details of frost and thermal overlays ground the high-concept premise effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story escalates density successfully, moving from a single test to a symphonic whole. However, the stakes feel low because there is no active resistance—the ice sings immediately upon request, and the protagonist risks no resources or failure, resulting in a "victory lap" narrative without tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of translating absence into presence is coherent and lands with a strong final image. The concept of "unshaken marvels" is well-integrated, though the text occasionally slips into explaining the theme ("not the absence of noise, but the presence of everything") rather than letting the imagery speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, atmospheric tone that suits the subject matter. There is a slight clash between the mystical tone ("stitched souls together") and the technobabble ("biometric sensors," "thermal overlays"), but the focalization remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative ("noise had become impossible"), but suffers from overwriting and telling-summary, particularly the list-like abstraction at the climax ("Love. Loss. Longing. Laughter..."). The reliance on "not X, but Y" constructions to define the concept becomes repetitive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central premise—using tuning forks to translate thermal emotion signatures in a frozen, silent world—is highly imaginative and transforms the post-apocalyptic survivor trope into something aesthetic and constructive. The synthesis of physics and grief is fresh.</comment>
