<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "share light without fire" is clear and grounded in backstory, but her interiority is heavily filtered through didactic thematic statements rather than organic emotional struggle. The character feels more like a vessel for the moral than a living person making difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and the closure (the child's reaction validating the method) lands with legible resonance. However, the structure relies on visible mechanical scaffolding, specifically the phrase "memories resurfaced" used three times to trigger flashbacks, which disrupts the causal flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the grotto, mist, and "moss-slick stones" are vivid and establish a strong, cohesive mood. The sensory immersion is effective, though the specific phrase "reflectively vibrant" feels jarringly distinct from the otherwise organic descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stakes remain largely abstract and internal; the conflict lacks active opposition or a moment where the protagonist's vow is genuinely tested. The resolution comes through the completion of a routine ritual rather than a high-pressure decision that carries visible risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is hammered home via a repetitive "not X, but Y" rhetorical structure used over eight times (e.g., "not to curse... but to learn," "not conquest... but polishing"). This excessive repetition turns potential subtext into an overt sermon, flattening the narrative's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical tone but suffers from severe syntactic monotony due to the overuse of the thematic template mentioned above. The rhythm becomes predictable, reducing the emotional impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Heavy repetitive artifacts severely mar the prose quality. The "not X, but Y" sentence template appears in nearly every paragraph, and specific phrases like "memories resurfaced" and "reflectively vibrant" are looped without variation, creating a draft-like quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept of "light without fire" as a trauma response is a compelling inversion of the Promethean trope. However, the execution follows a standard "wise healer in a cave" pattern without offering a surprising twist or deeper complication.</comment>
