<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The character is defined primarily by habit and backstory ("tried to ignore it once," "joints stiffen") rather than by immediate, high-stakes choices in a specific scene. Internal state is summarized ("she mourns the silence") rather than dramatized through a conflict that forces a deviation from her routine. The "patchwork" nature is a label that doesn't clearly inform her physical actions or decisions on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story operates as a vignette or montage of habitual actions ("Last Tuesday," "Sometimes") rather than a distinct scene with a specific inciting incident and singular climax. The iterative structure ("And when the moon is full... she climbs") prevents the accumulation of immediate narrative pressure or a decisive change in the status quo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the abstract themes in concrete details like the "rusted gantry" and "broken dish array." The sensory details ("scent of rain on dry concrete") establish a strong, melancholic mood that supports the concept of entropy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptual ("navigation of loss") and lack immediate urgency or opposition within the frame of the story. There is no on-page escalation; the narrative describes an established equilibrium without introducing a new threat or obstacle that forces the protagonist to adapt her tactics *now*.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of "reverse migration" is compelling, but the story relies on explicit thesis statements ("Maybe grief given syntax," "Raw solace isn't comfort") to convey it. The resonance is built through assertion and summary rather than emerging organically from a specific dramatic struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, though it occasionally creates distance through iterative narration ("She doesn't know," "She builds"). The tone is cohesive, but the reliance on poetic abstraction sometimes muffles the character's immediate presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the prose is polished, it relies heavily on rhetorical scaffolding (multiple "Not X, but Y" constructions) and dense metaphor ("tunes her bones like a theremin"). The frequent use of sentence fragments and list-like structures ("Altars of static. Shrines of dial tones.") creates a repetitive cadence that feels overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept of "reverse migration" applied to data/souls is a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes. However, the execution falls into the familiar "lonely watcher" archetype without subverting the expected static, meditative structure.</comment>
