<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s contradictory impulses—tenderness masked as combat—are dramatized with precision, creating a compelling internal conflict. Her motivation to mentor through "grit" drives choices that carry visible emotional cost, though the score is capped by line-level monotony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift from "siege" to "delta" in the tea leaves reprices the cartographer's despair and stabilizes the archivist's exile. The magic system’s logic is consistent and shapes the narrative arc effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the "shadow caught in glass" and "tilted mirrors" actively constrain the protagonist's movement. Sensory details like "bergamot-stained oolong" and "whalebone" bindings create a vivid, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high, with the threat of "reversible exile" escalating as the shadow pulses. The intervention with the cartographer serves as a meaningful tightening that resolves the immediate tension with a legible result.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of resilience is resonant, but the explicit definition in dialogue ("Resilience... isn't forged in comfort") triggers a thematic echo deduction. The final image enacts the concept more powerfully than the spoken thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the lexicon is distinct, the voice suffers from severe syntactic monotony due to a repetitive rhetorical structure. This creates a drumbeat rhythm that flattens the narrative distinctness, triggering the artifact cap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A pervasive template cadence ("not X, but Y") appears over 12 times, including at the closure beat ("not because... but because"). This repetitive structure turns the prose into a formulaic list, severely hampering flow and variety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of tea-leaf divination, cartography, and architectural hazard is highly original. The concept of "reversible exile" managed by walking backwards and reading geometry offers a fresh, specific take on the magical library trope.</comment>
