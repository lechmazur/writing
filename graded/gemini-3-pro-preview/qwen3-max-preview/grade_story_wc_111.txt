<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s voice is distinct, grounded in "gnarled" physicality and conviction. Her motivation—defending reciprocity against metrics—is unwavering and drives the scene. While slightly static due to her absolute certainty, the interiority effectively renders a worldview where memory outweighs data.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear Accumulative structure, layering the marble ritual before the intern's arrival tests it. Orientation is solid, and the ending lands a resonant "Earned Stasis" where she refuses to yield. The pacing is somewhat front-loaded with exposition, compressing the actual confrontation into a brief exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the tactile contrast between "cracked marbles" and "probability bands" anchors the conflict. Sensory details like the "golden resin" and "damp earth" are vivid and purposeful. The "empire of metrics" is effectively dramatized through the setting's rebellion (vines knotting paths).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central conflict is clear, but the antagonist (intern) provides weak opposition, retreating immediately upon her refusal. While the stance is heroic, the lack of immediate, dramatized cost or struggle reduces the tension. The victory feels granted by the premise rather than earned through a difficult trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity vs. calculation is coherent and beautifully illustrated by the marble metaphor. However, the subtext is occasionally made text (e.g., "counter-narrative to the empire of metrics"), explaining the meaning rather than letting the imagery do the work. The ending resonates well without resolving the external threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent fable-like register that suits the subject. The shift from the grounded gardening details to the intern's bureaucratic jargon is handled well. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing ("question mark made flesh") that draws attention to the author rather than the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Imagery is generally strong, though some metaphors border on mixed or overwrought ("heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness"). The sentence-level craft effectively supports the slow, deliberate pacing of the protagonist's ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core conflict (nature vs. algorithm) is a familiar trope, but the specific ritual of the marbles adds a fresh, personal dimension. The execution elevates a standard setup into a poignant vignette. The "magical garden" element provides a satisfying, if slightly convenient, resolution.</comment>
