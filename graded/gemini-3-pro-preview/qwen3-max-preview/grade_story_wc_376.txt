<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's "wilting" trait is brilliantly integrated, functioning not just as a quirk but as a physical constraint that dictates her movement and pacing through the setting. Her motivation is clear and relentless, though her internal landscape is somewhat linear—she is a martyr for truth without significant internal contradiction or temptation to abandon the quest. The shift in identity at the end ("become the archive") is a strong character beat earned by the action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the map's discovery to the journey and final realization. The "flashback" to finding the map ("Yesterday...") slightly drags the opening momentum, but the transition to the active quest is handled efficiently. Closure is distinct and resonant, reconfiguring the protagonist's role within the world with an implied ongoing cost of bearing witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, acting as an antagonist that physically pressures the character through "ambient untruths." The sensory details—ochre glow, humidity, ghost vines—are vivid and create a cohesive, oppressive atmosphere that directly influences the plot mechanics. The integration of the "wilting" mechanic with the toxic environment elevates the setting to a 9+ constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: physical survival versus the compulsion to uncover truth. The escalation is effective, with the character pressing deeper into the toxic city despite increasing physical debilitation. The climax (reading the letters) provides a satisfying release of tension, reversing the physical stakes (wilting) through the thematic action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central theme of truth as sustenance is powerful and well-executed through the magical realism elements. However, the final paragraph ("not with water, but with truth") explicitly explains the metaphor, reducing the resonant power of the ending image. A slight over-articulation of the thesis prevents a higher score here.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the fable-like tone of a "gilded-leaf calligrapher." The high register ("ligatures of longing") supports the character's background without becoming distracting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping us close to her physical sensations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative with strong rhythm and sensory density. There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("zinc-etched postal plate fragment," "shredded treasure map"), but the imagery is generally sharp and purposeful. The sentences propel the action forward effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—calligraphy, a toxic greenhouse dystopia, and a somatic truth-detection mechanic—feels fresh and specific. The concept of "wilting" near lies provides a unique lens for a quest narrative, transforming standard tropes into something memorable.</comment>
