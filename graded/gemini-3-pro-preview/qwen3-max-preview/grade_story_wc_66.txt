<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is compelling and distinct. However, the pivotal realization—that the broadcast is specifically singing about her—feels solipsistic and unearned, shifting her role from a dedicated scribe to a "chosen one" without sufficient setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure lands with a clear shift in agency, but the climax relies on a "Radio ex Machina." The protagonist does not deduce the solution (tears); the lyrics explicitly provide the instruction manual at the last second, undermining the causal chain and her agency in the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with constraints like the "story famine" and the radio's heat-based interface grounding the fantasy. The sensory details ("phantom flour," "moth-wing thread") are specific and effectively build the world's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high conceptually but low materially; the "famine" provides atmospheric rather than antagonistic pressure. The escalation is largely external (the radio getting hotter on its own), and the climax is reactive (following instructions) rather than a choice forced by direct opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection through memory and art is cohesive and poignant. The "dust remembering" concept resonates well, though the execution tilts toward sentimentality in the final beats ("thistled calm," "tears as catalyst").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice has a consistent lyrical quality, but it is marred by repetitive sentence structures that flatten the delivery. The poetic tone is effective for the fable-like setting but occasionally drifts into heavy-handed metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe repetitive sentence artifacting damages the rhythm; over 10 sentences begin with "She [verb]" (She scrambled, She watched, She began, She learned, She mapped, She froze, She understood, She sang, She cloaked). This template cadence persists through the closure, creating a monotonous list-like effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of transcribing pirate radio to resurrect dust-memories is imaginative and fresh. While the "music restores the world" trope is familiar, the specific mechanics of heat-based tuning and particle theater add a unique layer of ingenuity.</comment>
