<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct and competent, with a clear goal driven by backstory. However, her journey lacks internal contradiction or a difficult choice; the realization at the climax is an epiphany rather than a hard-won shift requiring sacrifice, resulting in a functional but friction-free arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Causality is clean and the magic system is internally consistent, moving logically from search to activation. The score is capped because the ending offers "symmetric satisfaction"—she succeeds completely with no visible or felt cost, leaving the "utterly satisfied" resolution feeling structurally too neat for high-band literary stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and conceptual, blending mathematics and poetry into a tangible environment that constrains the magic (hyperbolic geometry as storage). The specific sensory details ("chalk-dust tang," "pulsing story-cores") ground the abstract premise effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While the stakes (lost history) are high in concept, the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist encounters no significant resistance or antagonist. The climax resolves through competence without forcing a trade-off or loss, lacking the tightening of options required for higher scores.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of analog persistence versus digital decay is coherent and woven into the mechanics of the world. The resolution leans slightly didactic ("She understood then..."), articulating the theme explicitly rather than letting it emerge solely through the subtext of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and suitably lyrical, matching the "scientific poetry" subject matter without breaking character. The tone balances the whimsy of the premise with the gravity of the librarian's mission effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative with strong imagery. There is a slight reliance on a repetitive rhetorical structure ("Not X, but Y") to define concepts, but the line-level craft generally supports the atmosphere well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fusion of hyperbolic geometry and narrative theory is a fresh, specific take on the "magical library" trope. The execution feels inventive, though the plot trajectory itself is a fairly standard retrieval quest.</comment>
