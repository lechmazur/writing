<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as an archetype ("The Architect") rather than a fully realized character. Her motivation is abstract and philosophical ("texture of connection") rather than visceral, and she lacks embodied emotional reactions to the surreal threats, maintaining a static "unsettling calm."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works within the dream logic, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration ("walls settled"). However, the climax ("ceiling split") arrives "without warning," feeling slightly disconnected from the specific intensity of the protagonist's actions, and the resolution comes relatively easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong, vivid setting details ("marble cracked into lace," "walls breathing") effectively ground the surreal concept. The gallery functions as an active participant in the narrative, exerting pressure and reacting to the protagonist's weaving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tension is dampened by the protagonist's suppression of fear and ability to simply "ignore" the gallery's resistance (the mirrors). The climax lacks a difficult choice with visible cost; the resolution is achieved through procedure rather than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is heavily explicated rather than dramatized, particularly in the closing paragraphs where the narrative directly answers its own question ("The answer wasn’t in objects... It was in texture"). This essayistic approach flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a repetitive rhetorical cadence that mimics a lecture. The tone feels constructed to serve the allegory rather than arising organically from the character's experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Severe overuse of antithetical sentence structures ("not X, but Y") creates a monotonous, didactic rhythm (occurring ~10 times, e.g., "not escape or spectacle, but," "not with fabric, but with moments," "not collapsed—split"). Lush imagery occasionally slips into cliché ("sluggish as tar").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central concept of weaving memory to repair a surreal architecture is imaginative and distinct. However, the execution relies on familiar "mind palace" tropes and abstract telling, which limits the ingenuity of the final effect.</comment>
