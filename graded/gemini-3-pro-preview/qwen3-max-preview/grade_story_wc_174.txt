<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict between aesthetic perfection and moral accountability is compelling and clearly delineated. The transition from "urbane" detachment to "earned" serenity provides a solid character arc, though the "urbane" trait feels slightly at odds with the scavenger-puppet action until the deconstruction is understood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure effectively manages the timeline, using the dome as a frame for flashbacks that inform the present decision. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the decision to return with a new, risky method), and the causal chain from the "story stick" epiphany to the resolution is coherent under a Causal/Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is an evocative setting that mirrors the "abandoned signals" of the protagonist’s relationship. Sensory details like the rain as "Morse code" and the "half-lit" atmosphere effectively charge the scene, though the seedy bars are less spatially grounded than the dome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes—integrity and a relationship—are clear, though the conflict remains largely intellectual and retrospective until the final decision. The cost of the resolution (risking Mira's rejection of the "blood and honey" show) is acknowledged but feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but suffers from heavy-handed explication; the protagonist literally defines the moral ("ethical storytelling wasn’t about purity, but accountability"). The ending risks sermonizing ("Not by avoiding conflict, but by turning...") rather than letting the resonant image of the puppet speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending elevated, slightly purple diction ("velvet fog") with the gritty reality of the puppets. The third-person limited perspective stays firmly anchored in the calligrapher’s headspace, managing the reflective transitions smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("turning rivets into eyes"), though it occasionally leans into density that slows momentum. A few phrases feel slightly manufactured ("make poison look like calligraphy"), but line-level control is generally high with no distracting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of calligraphy, Cold War machinery, and subversive puppetry creates a highly original aesthetic that refreshes the "artist seeking redemption" trope. The specific combination of elements feels fresh and prevents the story from sliding into generic relationship drama.</comment>
