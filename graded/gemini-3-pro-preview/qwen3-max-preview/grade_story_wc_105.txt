<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal landscape is vividly rendered through the synesthetic graft, making her perception unique and character-specific. The integration of grief into technical motivation is strong, though the "sister" backstory feels like a standard functional lever rather than a messy, lived complexity. The character remains somewhat static in her determination, but the alignment of ability and need is compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative operates on a consistent dream-logic where metaphors (burning absences) function as physics, creating a cohesive Accumulative/Textural drive. The transition from forging to the "crack" of discovery is effectively paced, though the success feels inevitable rather than earned through a specific on-page tactical pivot. Closure is distinct (departure with the device), providing a clear change in status.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is lush and integral; the "sunken orchard greenhouse" ringed by shipwrecks provides the necessary acoustic environment for the plot’s central action. The imagery of "phosphorescent algae" and "cracked glass" actively supports the mood of decay and preservation. The environment constrains the protagonist's method, satisfying the requirement for setting as pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing the sound) is clear, but the "cellular division" clock functions more as atmospheric texture than an obstacle forcing a hard choice on the page. The protagonist faces the difficulty of the task, but the opposition is largely abstract; the "crack" happens because the ritual is complete, not because she overcame a specific resistance in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into utility is coherent but heavily explicated in the final paragraphs ("alchemy of grief turned into guidance"). The story relies on telling the reader the moral import of the device rather than letting the "memory-catcher" stand as a silent, resonant symbol. This overt thematic summary dampens the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, matching the surreal nature of the task. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through the specific "color-sound" lens of the neural grafts without slipping. The narrative distance is controlled, staying deep within the protagonist’s sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with mixed ontological lists like "soot and memory-dust." Some rhythmic artifacts appear in the discovery beat ("She froze. That was it."), which feels slightly generic against the otherwise unique imagery. The sensory details are generally vivid and support the tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi hearing aid designer with a metaphysical, magical-realist forging process is fresh and imaginative. While the "capturing a specific abstract sound" trope is familiar, the execution via synesthesia and "burning absences" offers a distinct and creative angle.</comment>
