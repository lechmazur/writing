<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s "arithmetic" motivation and "resignation" create a distinct, compelling interiority that eschews standard heroism. The internal conflict is dramatized through action rather than summary, though the traveler functions more as a catalyst than a fully fleshed counter-force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a powerful Earned Stasis; the choice to pass the key while remaining behind creates a felt cost that reweights the narrative. The Situational drive holds firmly, with the inciting incident and climax linked by clear, character-driven causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting acts as a dynamic constraint; the mechanical birds directly dictate the caretaker’s indirect methods (moss, pebbles), fulfilling the high-band requirement for environment shaping tactics. Sensory details like "clockwork currents" and "silver sap" are vivid and strictly filtered through the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly braided between the immediate survival of the girl and the protagonist's moral "arithmetic." The impending frost provides a coherent ticking clock that escalates pressure without feeling artificial, forcing a decisive risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of duty as a form of "graceless beauty" resonates naturally through the action without becoming preachy. The final image of assembling a path for a future he resents offers a sophisticated, non-literal resolution to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice possesses a consistent, melancholic texture that matches the protagonist’s "offhandedly exact" nature. POV is tightly controlled, with perception and knowledge strictly bound to the caretaker’s weary expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bled orange into violet," "auditory breadcrumbs") and no scaffold artifacts. The sentence-level propulsion mirrors the urgency of the fading light while maintaining the character’s measured pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork fantasy with a bureaucratic, weary tone feels fresh and specific. The non-confrontational resolution—guiding via "impressions" rather than fighting—subverts standard rescue tropes effectively.</comment>
