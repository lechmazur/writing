<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is hyper-competent and lacks internal conflict; she observes and confirms without genuine struggle or error. The explicit definition of her trait via exposition ("Her attribute—tranquilly perceptive—was not...") disrupts immersion and relies on diagnostic telling rather than dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well for an archival investigation, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the ending. The discovery of the Master Index feels slightly convenient (preserved by "design"), but the closure lands with a coherent stance of witnessing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like "silt-choked aisle" and "shattered skylight choked with kelp" grounding the sunken setting. The environment actively pressures the character, though the "muffled chaos" abstract description slightly dilutes the sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but the conflict remains static; the protagonist faces external environmental pressure but succeeds in every task without a moment of doubt or significant cost. The escalation is linear (finding increasingly damning evidence) rather than testing the character's resolve through difficulty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is over-articulated through aphoristic summary ("Truth, she knew, rarely roared—it seeped") rather than emerging organically from action. The narrative explicitly tells the reader the moral import of the indexer's actions, which flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, but the mechanical insertion of prompt elements ("Her attribute—...—was," "Her method—...—was") breaks the narrative spell. The signature "L. Page Indexer" feels slightly meta/artificial against the serious tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but leans toward purple abstractions ("shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts") and declarative summarization of internal states. Information density is good, but the "prompt-check" sentence structures create minor drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "archivist in a ruined city" is a familiar trope, and while the execution is competent, it hits standard beats without subverting them. The concept of the "alternative hypothesis" adds a small layer of procedural specificity, but the overall arc follows a predictable path.</comment>
