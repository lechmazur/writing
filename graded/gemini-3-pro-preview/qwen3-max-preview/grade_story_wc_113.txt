<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is a coherent vessel for the atmosphere but lacks internal contradiction or grit. Her motivation is stated ("unraveling") rather than tested by genuine resistance; she faces no difficult choices, only a linear process of discovery. The emotional experience is described ("heart full," "trembling") rather than embodied through conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is linear and lacks a meaningful turning point or "felt cost." The progression (arrive, decode, play, resolve) encounters no obstacles; the ghost is cooperative, and the closure—a "gift" of purpose—feels unearned by sacrifice or struggle. The logic of the "37 degrees" (angle or temperature?) is momentarily confusing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The strongest category; the flooded opera house is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("chairs floated like lily pads"). The setting actively constrains the method (wading, water as lens), integrating well with the premise. Some descriptions border on ornamental ("balconies weeping rust"), but the atmosphere is palpable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pressure is virtually absent. There is no antagonist, no ticking clock (the lantern dying happens after the climax), and no risk of failure. The ghost's immediate cooperation removes tension, resulting in a scene that feels more like a ritual enactment than a dramatic conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated rather than subtextually earned ("silence held more truth than sound"). The ending moralizes ("what, through her, would be remembered") instead of letting the image resonate on its own. The story tells the reader what to feel about the silence rather than dramatizing it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but maintains a lofty, somewhat distancing register ("calcified," "summoned"). It relies on a "poetic observer" filter that occasionally creates distance from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is fluid but overwritten, heavily reliant on adjective-noun pairings and metaphors that sometimes clutter the image ("black mouth swallowing moonlight"). Phrasing like "She believed—no, she knew" is a stock construction. The "precisely 37 degrees" detail is ambiguous (angle vs. temperature) and feels ungrounded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central concept of using water to decode warped ink as sheet music is inventive and specific. However, the broader plot—a musician playing a final concert for a benign ghost to grant it peace—is a familiar trope that isn't subverted or complicated here.</comment>
