<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and drives the plot, but the emotional logic of the final "smile" feels unearned; the leap from tension to beatific acceptance of entrapment relies on a trope rather than dramatized internal progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the "contact tracer" premise is established well, but the transition to the climax ("Lena ran") is abrupt. The closure (joining the ghosts) is legible but feels like a standard genre default rather than a specific causal result of her choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength, with tactile details like the "cold seeping into her bones" and the "crackling" aid grounding the scene. The setting exerts clear pressure on the protagonist's senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opposition is present via Elias and the environment, but the escalation is somewhat linear (warning -> ignore -> consequence). The stakes are high, but the protagonist's agency consists mostly of ignoring a warning rather than active tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of unheard voices is consistent and poignant. However, the articulation of this theme in dialogue ("echoes of the ones who were never heard") is slightly on-the-nose, reducing subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent atmospheric tone. Dialogue is functional but occasionally drifts into melodrama ("Neither should you") that feels less natural than the narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but relies heavily on cliché similes ("coiled like a living thing," "flickering like a dying bulb") which dilute the freshness of the imagery. Density is adequate, but these artifacts drag the score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts" is a compelling, fresh hook, but the story's structure follows a very traditional ghost story template (warning ignored -> assimilation) without subverting or transforming the genre expectations.</comment>
