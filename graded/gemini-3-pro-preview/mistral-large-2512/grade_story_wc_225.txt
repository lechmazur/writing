<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is anchored effectively by the physical motif of "productive fidgeting," which externalizes Elias's internal unrest. The transition to stillness at the closure earns the internal shift, though the realization relies heavily on an external projection (Liora) rather than a purely active choice, keeping the score from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the tapestry decoding to the memory confrontation, ending with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The middle section relies on summarized "decoding" rather than dramatized struggle, and the tapestry functions as a convenient device, but the closure lands with a distinct felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "woven hush" and the temperature-shifting labyrinth create a tactile, immersive atmosphere that actively constrains the protagonist. The setting details are purposeful and distinct, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate as the plot mechanics are slightly less integrated than the atmospheric elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between the desire for redemption and the immutability of the past. The physical escalation of the labyrinth's heat tracks the rising tension well, culminating in a decisive emotional confrontation that forecloses the option of changing history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness is woven well into the imagery of the labyrinth and tapestry. However, the climax relies on a direct Thematic Echo where the antagonist explicitly states the moral ("You only get to forgive yourself"), which flattens the subtext and triggers a deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending gothic sensibilities with precise observation ("celestial engine," "frayed hem"). The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Elias's perception, though the Q2 cap limits the score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and strong imagery like the "breath of frost." The text avoids scaffolding artifacts, though "winnowed like chaff" is a slightly standard idiom in an otherwise fresh textural landscape.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of the exiled tutor archetype with the magical labyrinth and tapestry elements feels organic and fresh. While the resolution (accepting one cannot change the past) is a familiar trope, the specific execution through the fidgeting motif adds a layer of original distinction.</comment>
