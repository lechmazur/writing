<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsion to map dust motes to predict his past feels more like a literary conceit than a grounded psychological reality, creating a slight distance. While his internal conflict between hiding and engagement is clear, the transition from musicologist to pigeon trainer reads as quirky backstory rather than lived consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The scene is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident (Lena’s entry) and a legible closure choice. However, the plot relies on the convenient coincidence of Lena finding the specific lyric sheet and the previous owner's note, which simplifies the investigative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The attic setting is atmospherically rendered with specific sensory details ("smelled of yellowed paper," "warped floorboards"). The spatial anchoring is solid, though the dust motes do heavy lifting for the "magical" ambience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal, externalized gently by Lena. While the stakes of losing the song are established, the immediate pressure of the scene is low until the reveal; the choice to stay is earned but the cost feels relatively low-impact on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Themes of loss and preservation are coherent but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("Proof that some things survive," "Graphs don't breathe"). The resonance relies on stated sentiment rather than emerging implicitly from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controls the close third-person POV well. The tone occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again"), which feels like a forced insertion of a prompt phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good sentence variety. There are minor lapses into cliché ("vanished like smoke," "sharp angles"), but the line-level craft generally supports the melancholic tone without impeding momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of disparate elements (Mars rock, pigeons, folk songs) adds freshness to the otherwise familiar "mysterious dusty bookshop" trope. The central metaphor of mapping dust is inventive, even if its execution feels slightly abstract.</comment>
