<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is legible, but the emotional arc relies on the stranger delivering diagnostic therapy-speak ("Grief isn't something you fix") rather than earned internal struggle. The protagonist's "aromatic caution" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through a high-stakes constraint or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scene is structurally sound and the setting anchors the action well, but the climax relies on a convenient oracle figure to explain the resolution. The closure (keeping the vial as a reminder) works as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of causal friction makes the earning feel light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength, with olfactory details effectively grounding the memory theme. The greenhouse of "ghost blooms" is a vivid, specific setting that mirrors the internal conflict, though the "lantern broker" occupation feels slightly ornamental to the immediate plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the encounter is gentle and the conflict remains abstract, lacking interpersonal friction or opposing goals. The protagonist is given the answer rather than being forced to wrestle it from the scene through a costly decision or risky action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("Grief isn't something you fix"), which flattens subtext and triggers the moralizing penalty. The story relies on stating its thesis in the climax rather than allowing the meaning to emerge organically from the imagery and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and moody, maintaining a stable POV throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("unravel a man") that feels slightly detached from the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mechanics are clean, but the prose relies on stock simile constructions ("like liquid twilight," "like dry leaves") that reduce freshness. The phrase "aromatically cautious" reads as an awkward insertion that tells rather than shows a sensory sensitivity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a greenhouse for extinct plants is imaginative but serves largely as a static backdrop for a standard grief-acceptance narrative. The resolution follows a familiar path without a distinct conceptual twist or deepening to distinguish it from genre conventions.</comment>
