<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elias functions more as a thematic vessel than a character with contradictory impulses; his internal state is summarized ("had no illusions") rather than demonstrated through difficult choices. The "coachman" identity is a label that does not inform his skills or perspective, leaving his gardening actions feeling disconnected from his established role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story operates as a linear vignette with an Accumulative drive, successfully completing the ritual of the seeds. However, the closure relies on summarized emotion ("his heart was not [lighter]") rather than a dramatized cost or a decisive shift in the status quo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The superimposition of the jetty over the forgotten battlefield creates a strong, specific sense of place. While atmospheric, some details lean on standard literary tropes ("scent of salt," "cry of a gull") rather than fresh, character-specific observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative tension is minimal; the environment offers no active resistance, and the heron serves as a permissive signal rather than a complication. The stakes remain abstract ("memory") without immediate, on-page pressure forcing a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of memory and renewal is consistent and coherent, though it is often delivered through direct authorial statement ("fertilize the idea of return") rather than emerging purely from the subtext of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and suitably melancholic but maintains a distant, expository distance, often explaining the significance of events ("understood... as if they were prayers") rather than allowing the reader to infer meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from indefinite similes ("something like a promise," "something older") and familiar phrasing ("skeletal remains," "forgotten tongue"). These artifacts dull the imagery and reduce the immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept of tending to a forgotten battlefield is resonant but executed with familiar "healing the land" tropes. The specific combination of elements feels somewhat prompted rather than organically synthesized into a fresh perspective.</comment>
