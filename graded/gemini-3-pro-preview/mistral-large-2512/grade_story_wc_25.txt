<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias is a grounded protagonist with clear, job-specific interiority ("nervous flipping," "teeth ache"). His obsession with the labyrinth's sentience is well-motivated by the backstory of the coin, though the "woman in yellow" functions more as a plot device than a fully realized counterpart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting discovery (the map) to a resolution (the exchange). The interpretation of the "lock" as a "walk" is a satisfying causal turn that rewards the protagonist's specific skillset. Closure is achieved through a "Charged Poise" moment that reconfigures the relationship between the characters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "static in his gloves" and containers leaning "like drunkards" effectively building atmosphere. The labyrinth directly constrains movement and shapes the puzzle, making the environment essential rather than just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tension escalates appropriately with the storm's intensity mirroring Elias's internal drive. The stakes are primarily intellectual and spiritual—proving the whispers—which works for the length, though the physical threat of the storm remains largely atmospheric rather than forcing a hard tactical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "listening" versus "shouting" is clearly articulated and dramatized through the climax. The coin and map serve as effective totems for this theme, though the dialogue ("Shouts are for the desperate") leans slightly towards aphorism rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending noir elements with magical realism. The POV stays firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his maintenance-worker expertise, which adds authenticity to the magical elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the prose is functional and has moments of strong imagery ("scars" on the map), it relies heavily on stock similes at pivotal moments ("hit... like a fist," "clear as a bell," "sharp as a blade"). These clichés flatten the emotional impact of the otherwise inventive climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central conceit—a physical movement pattern (a "walk") acting as a "lock"—is highly inventive and fresh. It recontextualizes the labyrinth trope in a way that feels specific to this character's world and skills.</comment>
