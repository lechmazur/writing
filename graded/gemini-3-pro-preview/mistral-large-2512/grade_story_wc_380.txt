<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marlowe’s grief is well-embodied through physical details like the crumbling flowers and the weight of the flame. However, the pivotal realization (“knew the truth now”) relies on internal summary rather than dramatized deduction, slightly flattening the agency at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible, moving from the anomaly to the coffee grounds to the chamber. Closure is strong and decisive, though the link between the grounds and the specific location relies on a genre-accepted coincidence that moves the plot a bit too conveniently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, with the "salt crystal growing chamber" and "pockets of gravity" actively pressuring the protagonist’s physical movement and choices. The sensory details ("tasted of ozone," "humming") create a vivid, immersive texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the choice between oblivion and a dangerous truth—is signaled early and escalates clearly. The external pressure of the gravity shifts creates a tangible cost that forces the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "echoes" versus "memories" integrates beautifully with the salt and preservation motifs. The ending reconfigures the loss into a form of persistence without offering a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric. However, the use of filter verbs and summary ("Marlowe knew," "felt different") creates unnecessary distance during moments that would benefit from direct sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative, particularly the descriptions of the salt and light. However, it is marred by a few stock phrases ("pulse quickened," "scattered stars") that detract from the otherwise distinct textural quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the industrial dock setting with the metaphysical "gravity whale" concept is fresh and imaginative. The premise feels specific and earned, transforming familiar tropes of grief into something unique.</comment>
