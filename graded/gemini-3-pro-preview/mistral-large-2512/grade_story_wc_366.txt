<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is embodied well in the sea glass, and leaving it is a strong, costly choice that earns the emotional shift. However, the transition to the abstract motivation of "protecting the feeling of safety" feels expository and diagnostic rather than organic to the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The climax relies on a physical impossibility under the "living" explanation—stones rearranging instantly behind his back suggests the supernatural, directly contradicting the protagonist's conclusion. This causality break confuses the nature of the interaction and the logic of the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "soot-streaked glass" and "bruised twilight" effectively ground the scene. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, serving as both a container for grief and the medium of communication.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emotional stakes are clear, and the cost paid—leaving the daughter's sea glass—is substantial and felt. This sacrifice effectively resolves the internal conflict of isolation, creating a meaningful tightening despite the murkier external mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit aphorisms in the notes ("The light was always in you"), which flattens subtext into platitude. The genuine resonance of the sea glass exchange is undercut by this overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally slips into "writerly" affectation ("bruised twilight," "slithered"). The POV stays close to Elias, but the "anonymous philosopher" tone of the notes jars against the skipper's reticence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is functional and rhythmic, but relies on familiar similes ("like a sentinel," "like fireflies"). The integration of the required phrase "luminescent ache" feels slightly repetitive when used twice in a short space.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of a lighthouse keeper discovering that "the light is within" is a familiar trope. While the stone-stacking mechanic adds a specific touch, the core narrative arc and moral conclusion feel derivative of standard inspirational fiction.</comment>
