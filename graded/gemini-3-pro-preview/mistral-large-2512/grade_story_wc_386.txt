<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, atmospheric protagonist with a clear role, but her pivot from "expose the truth" to "keep the secret" feels asserted rather than dramatized. The realization that "the dead... wanted silence" arrives before the ghostly confirmation, making the internal change feel convenient rather than earned by struggle. The emotional cost of her final renunciation is claimed ("truth burns too bright") rather than felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The middle section relies on a summary montage where deductive leaps happen off-page; fragments like "drowning in a hallway" do not causally prove "sabotage by quartermaster" without more connective tissue. A jarring tense shift in the second section breaks the narrative timeline. The closure works structurally but rests on these unearned logical steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The melted snow globe and the candle-lit ice shrine are evocative, specific anchors that effectively ground the supernatural elements. These physical details constrain the atmosphere and frame the inciting incident beautifully. The investigation settings (Reykjavik, Nuuk, Oslo) are mere labels, but the primary setting carries the weight well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central stake (Truth vs. Silence) is clear, but the climax relies on a brief, somewhat cliché exchange ("Ask the ones who lived") that deflates the tension. The ghost’s appearance functions more as a post-script confirmation than a pressure point forcing the protagonist's hand. The cost of silence is present but feels like a standard genre resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of utilitarian sacrifice ("locked passengers... to save lifeboats") is interesting but delivered through dialogue rather than emergent action. The concept of "windows of connection" is stated explicitly rather than woven subtly into the mechanics of the world. The ending leans on a familiar trope of benevolent cover-up without challenging the morality deeply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "ghost whisperer" archetype. However, the unmotivated shift to present tense ("She weaves truth carefully...") disrupts the established past-tense distance. The prose occasionally slips into explanatory telling ("Mara didn't believe in accidents") rather than trusting the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A definitive grammatical error (tense shift) caused by the insertion of a prompt element mars the polish. The investigation section relies on summary telling ("fitting them together until the picture became clear") which lowers engagement. Sentence rhythm is functional but lacks the propulsion needed for the deductive leaps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central image of the melted snow globe as a medium for ghost-seeing is a fresh, compelling innovation. However, the narrative arc—investigate a tragedy, find a dark secret, decide to bury it—follows a very standard genre template. The execution elevates the familiar plot, but the underlying structure is predictable.</comment>
