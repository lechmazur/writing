<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on summary ("felt whole," "gift had always been a curse") rather than embodied reaction. The epiphany is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a high-pressure choice or realization in the moment. Mara's internal state is coherent but lacks the friction or contradiction required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative breaks the short-story container by jumping from an urgent countdown ("hours away") to a montage ("Days passed"), dissipating the established tension. The closure is legible but feels unearned because the primary obstacle (growing the seed) is bypassed via time-lapse summary rather than active struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid but leans on standard ruin tropes ("iron ribs," "fractured light") without constraining the protagonist's choices. The greenhouse provides atmosphere but functions largely as a static backdrop until the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("only chance") but not tested; the process of growth is passive, and the success is inevitable. There is no visible cost or difficult trade-off; the fruit "absorbed her pain," framing the consequence as a benefit rather than a price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("It was about proving that even in ruins..."), replacing narrative subtext with a moral summary. This "explaining" flattens the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but suffers from "telling" syndrome, relying on labels ("informally wise") and exposition rather than dramatic demonstration. The narrative distance is too remote to create visceral engagement with the memory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is functional but marred by register clashes, specifically the insertion of clinical jargon ("synaptic plasticity") into a lyrical fantasy context. Adjective-heavy description ("iridescent sheen," "liquid memory") slows momentum without adding necessary density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core concept—healing memories in a ruined garden—is familiar territory (solarpunk/magical realism) executed without a fresh twist. The linear progression and lack of subversion result in a predictable "healing" arc.</comment>
