<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist possesses a clear, consistent motivation (to witness/preserve silence) that drives the central choice to destroy the book. However, the emotional cost is undercut by the narration stating she was &quot;unmoved&quot; at the climax, and the moment of internal doubt triggered by the swan is dismissed too easily to register as a deep struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Situational/Accumulative arc ending in Earned Stasis, where the protagonist rejects the disruption (the book) to restore order. While the closure is legible, the inciting incident (finding the book) and resolution (dissolving it) lack strong causal friction or difficulty, feeling somewhat like a soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the obsidian refuge and the library are rendered with vivid, specific sensory details that ground the surrealism. The setting actively facilitates the resolution (the river absorbing the ink), satisfying the requirement for the environment to constrain or enable choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (silence vs. the imposing narrative of the new book) is established, but the pressure remains low. The protagonist's ability to resolve the conflict instantly and without hesitation ("unmoved") deflates the tension, making the stakes feel abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of &quot;regenerative silence&quot; is well-integrated into the plot and character motivation. The ending resonates with the premise, though the final paragraph borders on summarizing the theme rather than letting the image of the dissolving book carry the full weight of the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and polished, suiting the meditative tone. There is a slight tendency toward &quot;writerly&quot; detachment that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience, but the perceptual signature remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and generally clear, with some strong imagery (&quot;forgotten tooth&quot;). However, it relies occasionally on familiar similes (&quot;gnarled as roots&quot;) and filter structures (&quot;she realized,&quot; &quot;she knew&quot;) that slightly dilute the immediacy of the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept of a keeper in a library of lost things is a familiar trope. While the execution is competent and the obsidian refuge adds a specific visual flavor, the story does not radically transform the premise or offer a sharply non-obvious angle on the archetype.</comment>
