<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct, well-drawn focalizer whose "noticer" archetype drives the narrative perspective effectively. The internal motivation to silence the house is clear, and the realization at the closure serves as a meaningful Conceptual Repricing of his worldview. The emotional distance fits the character, though a sharper sense of personal stake beyond curiosity would elevate the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from setup to action to consequence. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the house's nature is understood differently—lands with conceptual clarity. The "pause" moment serves as a strong, tangible irreversible change within the scene's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The animist setting is excellent; the "daydreaming" streetlights and "patient" water create a cohesive, breathing world that supports the central premise. The environment actively constraints the mood and reflects the protagonist's unique perception, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for setting as constraint/character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The conflict is subtle but coherent, focused on the tension between the protagonist's desire for stasis and the house's inherent life. The escalation works through the success of the ritual (the house stopping), which ironically deepens the mystery rather than solving it. A more visceral consequence for the "inadvertently profound" mistake would heighten the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence and the secret life of inanimate objects is developed well through the central metaphor of the orris root. The ending effectively recontextualizes the "creeping normality" not as a threat from outside, but as an internal rhythm of the world, offering a resonant closing thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elias's specific sensory bias. The prose maintains a "hushed" intensity that aligns perfectly with the subject matter. The personification of the environment is handled with stylistic control, reinforcing the animist worldview without becoming twee.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric, with high information density and strong imagery ("shard of hush"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "creeping normality" in the intro and outro feels slightly mechanical compared to the organic flow of the rest of the text, but the line-level craft is otherwise high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The use of orris root—a specific perfumery fixative—as a tool to "fix" silence is a genuinely ingenious synthesis that revitalizes the "living house" trope. The specific mechanical application of the magic system feels fresh and grounded in tangible detail.</comment>
