<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora functions more as an archetype than a fully realized character; her stoic reactions to the ghosts ("didn't flinch," "hands didn't shake") create emotional distance and lower the perceived cost of her labor. While her steadfast nature is established, the lack of visible internal struggle until the final tremble makes her feel impervious to the trauma she confronts. The connection between her happiness and the gravity mechanic feels imposed rather than psychologically integrated with the grief she is processing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving clearly from the ritual of stitching to the ship’s departure. However, the resolution relies heavily on the locket functioning as a "key" at the critical moment, which solves the central problem without requiring a decisive, hard-won turn from the protagonist. The closure is legible and valid as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ease of the climax dampens the impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story’s strongest element, effectively blending mechanical decay with metaphysical weight through details like "walls papered with faded photographs" and "corridors lined with ghosts." The environment actively participates in the narrative, grounding the abstract concept of healing in the tactile action of stitching the ship's skin. The atmosphere remains consistent and supports the tone of a "floating reliquary."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conflict is present but lacks genuine pressure; Liora succeeds in every confrontation with the ghosts immediately, offering the perfect affirmation without facing resistance or the risk of failure. The escalation is thematic rather than causal, leading to a climax resolved by the locket’s activation rather than a protagonist's difficult choice or sacrifice. The stakes are declared but not viscerally felt in the moment-to-moment action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, particularly in the explicit labeling of "Shadow work" and the sentimental summary at the end ("wept, but not in sorrow"). The narrative tends to explain the emotional significance of events rather than allowing the resonant image of the departing ship to speak for itself. This over-articulation reduces the complexity of the grief being explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elegiac tone that fits the "ghostly resolve" of the piece. At times, the register drifts into slightly purple abstraction ("droplet of liquid starlight," "gash of light") which softens the gritty reality of the recycled ship, but the overall control of distance and mood is effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("stitch its wounds—not with thread, but with memory"). Sentence variety is good, maintaining momentum through the ritual beats. Minor deductions for occasional cliché phrasing ("Shadow work, the old texts called it") that disrupts the otherwise fresh texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core image of physically stitching photographs into a spaceship’s hull to heal it is imaginative and visually distinct. However, the broader frame—a "last pacifist" healing a "refugee ark" via a magical tear—relies on familiar genre tropes that are executed competently but without significant subversion or surprise.</comment>
