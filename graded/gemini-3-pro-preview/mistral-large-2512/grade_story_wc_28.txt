<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation is clear, and the internal conflict between vengeance and mercy drives the narrative. However, the characterization relies heavily on explicit labeling ("gentle radical", "heart a quiet furnace") rather than purely dramatized behavior. The "arms of steel" line, while prompt-mandated, feels melodramatic and jarring within her internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scene has a legible arc and a definitive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the name is kept but redefined. However, the inciting discovery occurring "days ago" significantly lowers the immediate pressure; the scene reads more as a meditation on a past event than a reaction to a fresh shock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and tactile, with the charred cedar and damp stone grounding the abstract themes. The specific focus on the tesserae and the ruined minaret effectively constrains the action, though the opening simile ("sky split like broken glass") is slightly incoherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The internal stakes are well-defined, pitting personal trauma against a philosophical commitment to mercy. The pressure escalates appropriately as she physically engages with the stone, turning the abstract conflict into a concrete choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "aberrant mercy" is coherent and explored through the central action. However, the text relies on defining the theme explicitly ("that was what the old texts called it") rather than letting the concept emerge organically solely through the subtext of the rebuilding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric but stumbles over the forced inclusion of clunky prompt phrases like "retrocognitively trapped". These shifts in register disrupt the otherwise meditative and poetic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is functional and descriptive but marred by mixed or standard metaphors ("lodged in her ribs like a splinter", "split like broken glass"). The forced integration of prompt phrases creates noticeable friction, and the oxymoron "warm coldness" reads as an error rather than a poetic turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of rebuilding and renaming provides a fresh angle on the post-disaster trope. While the "magical empathy" element is familiar, the specific focus on the mosaic work gives the story a distinct, if not revolutionary, texture.</comment>
