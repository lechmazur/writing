<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mara is a competent protagonist, but she lacks internal contradiction or distinct flaws; her certainty about the "tricksters" removes ambiguity or struggle. Voss serves as a stock skeptic whose resistance is nominal, providing no genuine relational pressure. The emotional arc is linear (anxiety to hope) without the complexity of mixed feelings or costly choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story suffers from a "magic button" resolution; the subsonic generator resolves the central conflict instantly with no complication or trade-off. Causality is weak, as the connection between "subsonic frequencies" and "cosmic tricksters" is asserted rather than earned. The ending provides closure but lacks the required cost or consequence to make it resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The radio station setting is anchored clearly with details like the observation booth and warning lights. However, the atmosphere relies on standard genre descriptors ("low thrum of static," "loomed outside") rather than specific, sensory-rich textures that constrain the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>There is negligible escalation; Mara possesses the solution from the start and implements it with no effective resistance. The stakes are declared ("reality itself unraveled") but remain abstract, and Voss’s skepticism folds immediately, robbing the scene of genuine pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("Not by shouting, but by whispering") rather than emerging organically from the action. The narrative leans on moralizing summaries of the conflict rather than allowing the subtext to carry the weight of the division and healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and competent, maintaining a stable POV throughout. However, the dialogue tends toward the functional and cliché ("Not a theory. A solution."), serving to explain the plot rather than reveal character nuance or subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and readable, with clear sentence structures and no significant mechanical errors. It occasionally drifts into melodrama ("edge of revelation," "spaces between the stars") but maintains a steady, if standard, momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise of using a specific frequency to dispel supernatural chaos is a familiar genre trope executed here without a fresh angle. The "tricksters" element feels like a prompt insertion rather than a deeply integrated world-building concept, and the resolution is predictable.</comment>
