<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lira functions as a competent but standard archetype of the "gritty resistance survivor." While her motivation is clear, her interiority relies on familiar tropes ("drifter with too many questions") rather than specific, contradictory character traits. The emotional arc is serviceable but lacks the deep, idiosyncratic friction required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is linear and legible, moving from the lagoon to the broadcast. However, the climax relies on a convenient de-escalation ("enforcers hesitated") that weakens the causal stakes of the broadcast. The blend of magical realism (puddle maps) with hard-tech servers creates a slight world-logic friction that isn't fully resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The opening image of the "auric lagoon" and the concept of "puddle maps" are vivid and atmospheric. However, the server room description ("humming servers," "dead screens") falls into generic sci-fi shorthand. The transition from the magical exterior to the mundane tech interior feels texturally disjointed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (truth vs. erasure), and the pressure escalates appropriately until the final beat. The tension deflates prematurely when the enforcers simply waver upon seeing the broadcast; a more costly or chaotic reaction would have maintained the scene's established pressure better.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit didactic statements ("That was the tyranny of indifference...") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The concept of "rewriting" history is central but handled with heavy-handed exposition that tells the reader what to feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a serious, atmospheric tone. However, it leans on melodramatic phrasing ("liquid fire," "guts of the machine") that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate, grounded experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is readable but heavily burdened by somatic clichés ("breath shallow," "stomach twist," "heart hammering," "eyes gleaming"). These stock phrases flatten the physical immediacy of the scene, preventing the sensory writing from achieving a literary standard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "puddle map" concept is a flash of ingenuity, but it sits awkwardly atop a very standard cyberpunk plot (uploading the truth to topple a regime). The story relies on familiar genre beats without subverting or deeply personalizing them.</comment>
