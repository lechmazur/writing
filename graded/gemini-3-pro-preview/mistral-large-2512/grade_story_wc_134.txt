<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elias possesses a distinct, promising trait ("mundane clairvoyance"), but he remains a passive witness to the Pilgrim's actions rather than a driver of the plot. His stated gift "fails him" at the critical moment, reinforcing a lack of agency that weakens the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative functions effectively as a fable with a clear decisive change (Conceptual Repricing of magic), but the "three days later" transition reads like summary and dilutes the tension of the initial discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like singing stalactites and pulsing quartz create a vivid atmosphere. The "bright darkness" motif frames the setting well, though the oxymoron feels slightly repetitive by the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from wonder to survival, but the conflict is driven entirely by the secondary character. Elias questions the Pilgrim ("At what cost?") but takes no active steps to alter the outcome until the catastrophe is inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of hubris and the hidden cost of magic is coherent and resonates through the action. However, the final paragraph leans into explicit moralizing ("And now, he knew...") rather than trusting the image to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lyrical voice suits the fable-like mode and shifts effectively from wonder to horror. The narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though internal monologue occasionally slips into expository explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with strong imagery ("shadows grew teeth"), though the required phrase "steadily unpredictable" is syntactically awkward and feels inserted rather than organic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of a clairvoyant who only perceives the mundane is a fresh, ironic hook. However, the surrounding plot—unlocking dangerous power in a cave—relies on familiar fantasy tropes without significant subversion.</comment>
