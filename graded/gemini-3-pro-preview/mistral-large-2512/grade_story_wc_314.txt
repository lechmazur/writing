<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation is consistent, but interiority relies on stock phrasing ("breath she hadn’t realized") and summary rather than embodied, contradictory struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Legible closure (shattering crystal) and clear arc, though the progression is linear and the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sensory details are present but suffer from adjective density ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "liquid") that creates a "purple" effect rather than specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Escalation is mostly reflective; the dominant stake ("final transformation") is declared but lacks immediate on-page pressure or opposition to force the choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit interior monologue ("Magic... was not a formula") rather than subtext, flattening the potential for resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistent but generic, relying on familiar fantasy registers without a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>A significant cliché in the second sentence ("breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding") and adjective stacking severely undercut line-level freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "scientist accepts magic" premise is executed competently but follows a standard template without a fresh subversion or specific, lived-in detail.</comment>
