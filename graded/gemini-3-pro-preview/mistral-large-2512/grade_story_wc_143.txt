<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is consistent but functions more as a vessel for observation than a character under pressure; his internal state relies on "poetic" tropes ("poets and lovers") rather than contradictory impulses. The lack of a difficult, active choice leaves him somewhat static, with agency limited to a predetermined task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure lands, but the scene involving chemical reactions is a structural detour that contributes nothing to the causal chain. The ending relies on an internal realization that feels slightly disconnected from the immediate action of the photograph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength, with grounded sensory details like the static-clinging dust and scanner readouts creating a vivid lunar texture. The blend of high-tech gear and the "relic" camera is slightly jarring but acceptable within the nostalgic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conflict is largely abstract; the threat of bulldozers is distant, resulting in low immediate pressure on the page. The story functions as a mood piece without a significant tightening of stakes or a pivotal turning point that forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>While the theme of transience is coherent, the ending explicitly articulates the thesis ("It was about accepting..."), which flattens the subtext. This explanatory closing sentence robs the final image of its potential resonance by doing the reader's work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, establishing a cohesive mood. However, it tends toward romantic abstraction ("symphony no one would ever hear"), which creates a layer of distance rather than intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished but frequently relies on clichés ("fragile marble," "sound so small it might as well have been a sigh") that dull the imagery. Over-reliance on familiar "space sublime" metaphors prevents the line-level craft from reaching higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise of a lone observer documenting nature before industry is a standard trope that is not significantly transformed here. The execution is safe and traditional, lacking a fresh conceptual angle or risk-taking in structure or perspective.</comment>
