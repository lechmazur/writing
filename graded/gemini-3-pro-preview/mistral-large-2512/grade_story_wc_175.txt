<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies on expository definition ("She was an esoteric realist, which meant...") rather than behavior; Liora acts as a passive vessel for the theme without distinct internal friction or contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with intended thematic weight, but the linear progression lacks causal density—events happen to the protagonist rather than being forced by her choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and consistent, effectively using sensory details like the stacked stones and mist; however, the "suspended between earth and sky" location blurs orientation slightly without adding necessary pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is low-pressure and stakes remain abstract; the monarchs' arrival feels inevitable rather than earned, and the protagonist faces no significant external resistance or hard trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of transience is clear but handled heavy-handedly through explicit statements (the notebook entry, the memory of the woman) rather than emerging organically from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical but occasionally overwrought ("blushing stillness"), leaning into a "precious" tone that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by a clichéd final image ("space between the beats of a heart") and some mixed metaphors ("mist... like smoke from a doused fire") that weaken the closing impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of ephemeral signals for butterflies is evocative, but the execution follows a safe, familiar literary-fantasy template without a fresh or risky narrative turn.</comment>
