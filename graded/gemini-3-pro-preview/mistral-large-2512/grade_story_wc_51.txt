<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract labels for emotion ("guilt," "regret") rather than embodied behavior. The title "fractal weaver" is ornamental; Liora interacts with the lamp and stones, but the specific logic of "weaving" or "fractals" never informs her choices or tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is functional but resolves via a soft reset; Liora ends the conflict by simply deciding to stop ("not hers to keep"), rendering the stated risk ("turning her bones to bronze") toothless. The ending feels unearned by the prior struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "bronze grotto" is a vivid, tactile setting that actively shapes the ritual. The specific detail of the "north wall where the bronze was thinnest" grounds the magic system in the physical environment effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("calcified air would claim her") but never felt; the protagonist controls the pacing perfectly and exits the ritual before the cost becomes unavoidable. The burden's "sharp pain" is mentioned but does not force a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative summary ("burdens were not hers to keep, but hers to understand"), robbing the reader of interpreting the subtext. This didactic "telling" of the moral flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though occasionally overwrought ("shingled hush"). The awkward phrasing "boundary-lessly" disrupts the lyrical tone and pulls the reader out of the immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("splinter of bone"), but the hyphenated adverb "boundary-lessly" is a significant stylistic stumbling block. Information density is good, though some scaffolding ("Liora knew the risks") remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The central concept of calcifying abstract emotional burdens into physical objects using a specific lamp orientation is inventive and fresh. This imaginative mechanism elevates an otherwise standard "letting go" narrative.</comment>
