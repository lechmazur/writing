<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc from "reticent" to a willingness to "testify" provides a clear internal shift driven by the scene's events. However, the cost of this transition is abstract—the "weight of discovery"—rather than a deeply felt personal or physical price on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building through experiments to a Conceptual Repricing of the city's mutations as memories. While the closure is legible and conceptually sound, the progression is linear and lacks causal friction; the experiments succeed without complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and sensory-rich, with the library's "aged paper and beeswax" and "groaning timbers" actively supporting the sound-based magic system. The setting integrates well with the plot, reacting to the protagonist's actions rather than serving as a static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are intellectual—decoding a pattern—which fits the scholar archetype but lacks immediate on-page pressure or resistance. The escalation is a smooth ramp of successful tests rather than a struggle against constraints or antagonism, limiting the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central theme of sonic memory is resonant, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the penultimate paragraph, explicitly stating the thesis ("silence was not the absence of sound...") instead of letting the subtext carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a scholarly and reverent tone that suits the protagonist. Internal monologue and perception are well-controlled, avoiding head-hopping and staying firmly within Elias's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Physical blocking is repetitive; the protagonist picks up and places the crystal on the desk three separate times, creating a mechanical loop. Phrasing occasionally relies on stock descriptions ("shadows dance," "blurred, then sharpened") that dull the otherwise solid prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of "acoustic botany" and crystals recording history is imaginative, but the framework—a solitary scholar having an epiphany with an artifact in a library—is a familiar trope. The story executes the template competently but does not radically transform it.</comment>
