<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("fractured," "whole") rather than embodied emotion, triggering the label-speak penalty. The resolution—a sudden feeling of wholeness after a brief vision—reads as an unearned switch-flip rather than a psychological shift paid for by the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Structure is coherent, but the climax hinges on a convenient reinterpretation of the prop ("the tablet... had been a warning") that deflates tension. While closure is technically present as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the "soft reset" ending resolves the central conflict without sufficient on-page cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The viaduct is established with decent sensory grounding ("wet stones," "ozone"), but the "labyrinth of self" dissolves into abstract descriptors ("infinite permutations") that lack tactile specificity. The setting essentially disappears during the pivotal middle sequence, reducing environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and internal, with the antagonist (the older self) serving as a vehicle for advice rather than a source of active pressure. The central conflict is resolved through a verbal explanation that instantly fixes the protagonist's mindset, lacking visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story violates subtext rules by explicitly stating its themes in dialogue ("You can't conquer the labyrinth," "You are periodically eternal"). This reliance on thesis statements instead of dramatic implication flattens the narrative resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is functional but generic, leaning on standard fantasy register without a distinct perceptual grain. It occasionally slips into melodrama ("sound like breaking glass") that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is weakened by clichés ("sound like breaking glass," "snapped back") and summary-telling ("He felt whole") at crucial moments. The meta-commentary on "procedural generation" disrupts the immersive texture, reading as authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "mirror-match" confrontation and the "labyrinth of the mind" are familiar tropes executed here without a fresh subversive angle or specific mechanical twist. The synthesis of elements feels standard for the genre rather than offering a unique vision.</comment>
