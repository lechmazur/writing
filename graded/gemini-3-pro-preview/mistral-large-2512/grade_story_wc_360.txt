<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct focalizer with a clear, obsessive motivation ("mathematics of emotion") that drives the scene. The "borrowing personalities" trait is dramatized effectively as a mechanism for dialogue and internal conflict, though the personalities function more as thematic mouthpieces than deep psychological shifts. The "hollow" state at closure indicates a felt cost, grounding the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from solitary obsession to intrusion and loss. The inciting incident (finding the fragment) is backstory, but the arrival of the woman serves as a functional on-page catalyst that forces the climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the loss of the fragment and the "unraveling" of self—landing with clear causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the "topaz glass" and "dying starlight" creating a specific, pressurized atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The sensory details ("ink that smelled of old parchment and copper," "fractured rainbows") are dense and evocative, successfully grounding the abstract mathematical concepts in physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates adequately through the intensifying voices and the arrival of the antagonist, leading to a single meaningful tightening (the theft of the voice). While the stakes are ostensibly cosmic, the conflict resolves somewhat abruptly with the woman's arrival and the fragment's dissolution. The cost is visible (hollowness, loss of the artifact), fulfilling the requirement for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is central but delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("Empathy isn't a bridge—it's a theft," "The universe doesn't care..."). These explicit thesis statements reduce subtextual nuance, turning characters into vehicles for the premise rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from action. This triggers the penalty for thematic echoing in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and controlled, effectively managing the shifts between the protagonist's own thoughts and the "borrowed" personas. The distinction between the "Poet" and "Mathematician" voices contributes to the story's texture without breaking the third-person limited perspective. The tone remains consistent even during the surreal climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and atmospheric but leans toward overwriting with a high density of similes and metaphors ("gaps like missing teeth," "barnacles," "ship in a storm"). Some phrasing feels slightly abstract or precious ("velocity of joy," "geometry of grief"). However, the line-level rhythm is strong, and the imagery generally supports the tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a letterpress operator mapping emotions in a dying universe is imaginative and visually distinct. The "empathy as theft" concept offers a fresh subversion of a common trope. While the "mathematical magic" is a known genre element, the specific synthesis here feels original and engaging.</comment>
