<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is consistent but relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("geography of healing," "intimate act") rather than embodied emotion. The character's struggle is articulated through abstract metaphors and summary, creating distance rather than a visceral experience of her specific grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (planting the thread). However, the scene is largely static with retrospective movement, and the closure, while thematically legible, lacks a strong sense of immediate cost or structural inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is cohesive, and the specific prop (the golden thread) effectively anchors the abstract concept of connection. However, descriptions occasionally veer into "purple" territory ("breath curled... like a sigh"), reducing the sharpness of the imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>External pressure is minimal; the stakes are theoretical (the kingdom's healing) rather than immediate to the protagonist in the moment. The escalation is purely internal, lacking a tightening of options or a forced trade-off with tangible on-page consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("trying to map the way grief moved," "not for the dead—they were for the living") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation flattens the resonance of the final symbolic act and limits interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic, lyrical register appropriate for the protagonist. However, the reliance on high-register, poetic phrasing occasionally feels performative, prioritizing sound over character-specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is competent and rhythmic but marred by clichés ("swallow her whole," "flashing like fireflies") and metaphor stacks. Phrases like "geography of healing" read as abstract therapy-speak rather than fresh imagery rooted in the story's concrete reality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core concept of an obituary writer for the living is compelling and fresh. However, the execution relies on familiar tropes (dying king, secret illness, garden reflection) without subverting them significantly or adding a unique twist to the setting.</comment>
