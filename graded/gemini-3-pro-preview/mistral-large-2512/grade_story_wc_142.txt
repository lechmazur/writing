<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") and summary rather than dramatized action. Lan’s traits are asserted by the narrator—we are told she is "quick with a knife"—but we do not see her make a difficult, cost-laden choice in a specific scene. The internal conflict ("dual allegiance") is described as a burden but does not force a tradeoff on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on extensive summary to bridge the inciting incident and the climax, skipping the actual struggle. The closure is a "Thematic Echo" failure: the conflict (investors/vote) is resolved by a platitude ("we choose it") rather than a causal action or a paid cost. The ending ignores the established threat, offering assumed resolve without earning it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting of Carnivale is visually evocative with decent contrasts between the wooden raft and neon gentrification. However, the environment serves mostly as a backdrop; specific physical details of the raft do not constrain the protagonist's tactical choices in the final scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Escalation is summarized ("She started small," "She convinced the cooks") rather than experienced through a specific high-pressure beat. There is no on-page moment where the antagonist presses Lan to the breaking point; the stakes are declared but not tested in a dramatized encounter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final dialogue ("The raft survives because we choose it"), triggering the penalty for thematic statement replacing dramatic resolution. Subtext is thin; the text states the social commentary (gentrification "wore a smile") directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is functional but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining Lan's nature and the world's meaning instead of letting actions speak. The tone is consistent, but the distance prevents deep immersion in Lan's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is readable but dense with stock metaphors and clichés ("circling like vultures," "burden she carried like a second skin," "trust was a currency"). While the rhythm is smooth, the reliance on familiar phrases and summary blunts the impact of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The concept of a raft city facing gentrification is a solid, if familiar, trope. The specific "organizer" trait is an interesting potential hook, but because it is summarized rather than demonstrated in a unique puzzle-solving scene, the story feels like a standard YA dystopian template.</comment>
