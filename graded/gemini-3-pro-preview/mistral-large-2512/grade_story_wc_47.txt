<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is well-rendered, particularly his observation of Mira, but the "notebook" beat resolves with implausible ease. Mira’s acceptance of his surveillance without friction bypasses a key opportunity for relational conflict, making the reconciliation feel slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving from isolation to a shared ritual that functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The orientation is clear, though the transition from the viral video backstory to the present scene relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story’s strongest element; the juxtaposition of the sterile data center with the encroaching moss garden effectively grounds the central metaphor. Sensory details like the "drip of thawing icicles" and "veins of a leaf" actively texture the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Escalation is muted; Mira is already waiting for him, and her immediate acceptance of the notebook dissolves potential tension before it can peak. The stakes are intelligible, but the lack of opposition or difficult trade-offs results in a scene that feels pre-resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of healing is coherent but undercut by the final paragraph, which explicitly summarizes the moral ("one that said some wounds could be tended..."). This overt thematic statement replaces the resonance of the final image with instruction, triggering a deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the atmospheric setting well. There is a slight register shift between the "memed" viral context and the "loam" of the garden, but the control over psychic distance remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though occasionally overwrought ("golden glow," "silent promise"). The repetition of "honeyed" (dialogue description and setting description) is noticeable but functional. The final simile ("unraveling like the thawing icicles") borders on pathetic fallacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of repurposing a data center as a garden of grief is a fresh synthesis of tech and nature tropes. While the emotional arc is familiar, the specific setting elevates the material above standard domestic drama.</comment>
