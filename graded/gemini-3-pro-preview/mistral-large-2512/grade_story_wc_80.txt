<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is consistent, but the "stoically sensitive" trait serves as a diagnostic label rather than a dramatized behavior, triggering a deduction for label-speak. The internal landscape is described through summary ("feeling the weight") rather than contradictory impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is effective, using the rising water as a ticking clock to pressure the ritual. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the repetitive beat structure (find note, write note) feels slightly mechanical before the final turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s strength, with the submerged pavilion providing a tactile, dynamic constraint. Sensory details like the tar-like ink and the water seeping into boots ground the abstract "memory" theme in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but low-pressure, centered on a quiet internal struggle against oblivion. The escalation works via the water level, but the conflict remains largely thematic; the "cost" is philosophical rather than an urgent, irreversible trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme is heavily explicated through the notes, which function as direct thematic statements ("Love isn't the opposite of surrender"). This reliance on characters articulating the thesis reduces subtextual tension and creates a "Thematic Echo" effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric ("hushed blaze," "interlaced with"). It occasionally leans into sentimentality, but the tone matches the romantic, melancholic subject matter without breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good momentum, though it relies on some stock phrasing ("sigh held too long," "curse and a gift"). The diagnostic character description slightly drags down the otherwise solid line-level execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of a sinking pavilion is evocative, but the "letters to the void/past" trope is executed with familiar beats. The specificity of the shore surveyor and the inkwell elevates it above a generic prompt response.</comment>
