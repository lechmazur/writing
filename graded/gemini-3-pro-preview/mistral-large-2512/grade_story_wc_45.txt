<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "skeptic" label flatly contradicts the protagonist's immediate, unquestioning reliance on magic; she acts as a faithful practitioner, leaving the stated internal conflict of belief undramatized. While the motivation to "turn mistakes into constellations" is poetic, it drives a linear path without the hesitation or scrutiny that would make the character's specific traits consequential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative path is frictionless; the ritual works instantly and the maze yields without exacting a visible price, resulting in a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned. The closure is happy but lacks the "felt cost" or sacrifice required to give the ending weight under the rubric's standards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like the tooth "sharp with the memory of a child’s bite" and the "silver that pulsed like veins" create a strong, mythic atmosphere. The spatial logic is mostly clear, though the transition where the maze unfolds "before her" while she is already in the garden (behind the maze) creates a momentary hesitation in tracking the geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Tension is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or significant obstacles; the solution is achieved through a magical transaction rather than a high-stakes struggle. The lack of a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a sacrifice is required flattens the dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of healing and acceptance is coherent but relies on explicit explanation ("She understood then") rather than emerging organically from the action. The concept of "bone-setting" as a metaphor for social restoration is compelling but resolved too tidily to resonate fully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and fable-like, maintaining a consistent distance that suits the mythic tone. It occasionally slips into "telling" internal states ("She was a forgiving skeptic") rather than showing them through behavior, but the overall texture is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery ("stars trapped in enamel"), but relies on a few clichés ("heart pounding", "felt in her bones") and abstract phrasings ("cleft in certainty"). The repetition of "bone" ("bone-setting", "felt in her bones") in close proximity is a minor distraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the changeling myth with the "bone-setting" metaphor offers a fresh angle on a classic trope. However, the "misunderstood monster/child" resolution is a familiar pattern, and the lack of a subversive twist or deeper complication limits the story's ingenuity.</comment>
