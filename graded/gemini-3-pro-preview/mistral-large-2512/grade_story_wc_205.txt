<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct presence with coherent interiority, though his "revolutionary" backstory feels more like a label than a driving force until the end. The dynamic with Liora relies on a standard "believer vs. skeptic" archetype, which limits the complexity of their interaction. The emotional progression is logical, moving from defensive nostalgia to active reclamation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure—reconfiguring the archive through the mirrors—lands with a legible effect. However, the resolution relies on a "magical" ritual that functions conveniently without a precise causal mechanism or severe complication. The cost is physical exhaustion ("breath shallow"), which is functional but lacks deep narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "baroque asteroid" and "visible threads of time" create a vivid, atmospheric container for the action. The sensory details of the storm and the archive's architecture effectively ground the metaphysical stakes. The environment actively pressures the characters, particularly through the time storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The external pressure of the temporal storm effectively forces a deadline, and the ideological conflict with Liora sharpens the stakes. However, the conflict remains largely verbal until Elias initiates his ritual, and Liora functions more as an obstacle than a complex antagonist. The escalation is linear and competent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "poetry vs. data" is handled with a lack of subtlety, particularly in the dialogue ("Sentiment won’t rebuild a civilization"). The story resolves into a somewhat tidy moral victory for art, lacking the complexity or ambiguity required for higher bands. The explicit thematic statements in conversation flatten the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the baroque setting. However, the dialogue tends toward the expository and on-the-nose ("You’re erasing it"), which reduces naturalism. The transition between the protagonist’s internal poetic register and his spoken defiance is seamless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. Phrases like "burnished sorrow" lean toward the ornamental but fit the established aesthetic. The sentence-level craft effectively supports the atmospheric weight of the story without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of "archaeology of poetry" combined with "time storms" is a fresh synthesis of sci-fi tropes. While the character dynamics are familiar, the specific mechanism of using mirrors to catch time threads offers a touch of ingenuity. The execution elevates a standard premise.</comment>
