<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal arc relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go") rather than dramatized struggle. The epiphany feels convenient and intellectualized, lacking the embodied resistance that would make the final renunciation feel earned. The transition from holding on to letting go happens without sufficient on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, functional arc to a Decisive Change (dropping the locket), providing legible closure. However, the turning point hinges on a bird's arrival and a sudden realization rather than accumulating causal pressure. The causality is internal and slightly soft, moving from reflection to resolution with minimal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory details like the warm wood, salt, and sea lavender effectively ground the scene and support the mood. The "blooming jetty" offers a specific, vivid image that anchors the abstract emotions. The setting actively participates in the mood, though it doesn't strictly constrain the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear but the escalation is weak; the conflict is entirely internal and resolves with little resistance. The protagonist reasons his way to the conclusion rather than being forced by a dilemma or external urgency. The cost is the loss of the photo, which is significant, but the decision process leading to it lacks tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("preservation... let her go") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending leans into sentimental abstraction ("whisper in the wind") rather than a harder, more resonant ambiguity. The "proximate causes" line disrupts thematic subtext with abstract jargon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "archivist" persona. However, the prose occasionally drifts into generic literary poeticism ("past press against his ribs"). The narrative distance is stable, but the interiority often summarizes emotion rather than embodying it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally competent, but several required phrases ("when context changed," "proximate causes") are inserted clumsily, creating register clashes. The climax suffers from abstraction ("proximate causes") right at the moment of highest emotional weight. These artifacts disrupt the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of a grieving sibling letting go at the water's edge is a familiar trope handled here in a standard way. While the "covenant" idea hints at something fresh, it remains background lore rather than a driving narrative force. The execution stays within safe, conventional boundaries.</comment>
