<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maris functions as a static archetype (the wise mystic) rather than a contested character; she faces no internal contradiction, and the interaction lacks the friction or risk required to reveal depth under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scene is coherent and orientated, but the arc is flat; the inciting accusation ("witch") resolves immediately via a convenient prop without forcing a hard choice, creating a low-cost closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dental mirror and shutters provide specific, tactile grounding that anchors the scene well, though the "bruised evening sky" is a generic descriptor that limits the atmospheric ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are nominal and the conflict evaporates instantly; the girl capitulates to the first gesture without escalation, leaving the tension resolved by easy understanding rather than struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated ("This was her work: to teach darkness...") rather than dramatized; this didactic insertion flattens subtext and reduces the ending to a moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and controlled but leans into a reverent, precious tone that feels slightly manufactured; the "hushed tones" atmosphere distances the reader from visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mechanics are generally clean, but "spiralingly" is a clumsy adverbial construction that breaks rhythm, and the prose relies on explanatory telling ("The effect was mesmerizing") to assert impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "misunderstood wise outsider healing a child with silence" is a worn trope; while the dental mirror is a fresh detail, the emotional arc follows a safe, predictable template.</comment>
