<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena represents a stock archetype (trauma survivor in wedding dress) with motivation articulated through abstract narration rather than specific, difficult choices. While the trauma is clear, her internal state relies on repetitive, formulaic constructions ("She didn't know X, but she knew Y") rather than embodied psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story functions as a prologue rather than a complete narrative, failing the closure requirement by ending on a "to be continued" hook ("The hunt wasn't over") instead of a decisive change. The central scene lacks a causal turn; the protagonist demands information, receives it without struggle, and leaves, resulting in a flat trajectory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is suitably grim, but the "floating" aspect of the observatory is underutilized, appearing only in the opening line without affecting spatial choreography. Descriptions lean toward cliché ("creaked like a dying beast," "fractured glass," "jagged shards") rather than specific, sensory observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pressure is minimal; the antagonist (the ghost) capitulates immediately to Lena's command ("Show me"), removing necessary friction from the climax. The external clock (cooling breakers) provides artificial urgency but does not force a tradeoff or alter the outcome of the central interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("It’s not just energy—it’s choice") and heavy-handed narration ("grief made manifest"), violating subtextual subtlety. The story tells the reader what it means rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is severely compromised by a repetitive syntactic tic used four times in a short space: "Lena didn’t [understand/know] X, but she [understood/knew] Y." This template cadence flattens the character's distinct perception into a rhetorical formula.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting ("hollows of her bones," "weight of too many forgotten dreams") and a severe template cadence artifact (the "didn't know/but knew" loop repeated in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 8). These mechanical repetitions obscure the narrative flow and reduce literary quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise of a "scavenger bride in a tech-ruin" is visually distinct but executed with derivative tropes (logs found in ruins, mysterious crystals). The narrative plays it safe, relying on vague "science of grief" concepts without grounding them in a fresh, specific reality.</comment>
