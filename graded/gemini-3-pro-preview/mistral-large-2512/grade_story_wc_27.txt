<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lira is a coherent focalizer with established roots (grandmother/stargazing), but her internal state is largely delivered through exposition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The trait "awkwardly confident" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through interaction or difficult choice. The final action—touching the stone—feels like a destiny fulfilled rather than a hard-won decision with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path under a Causal lens: hum draws character, character touches stone, magic returns. However, the closure falls short of the rigorous cost requirement; the "reigniting" happens simply because she shows up, lacking a "Decisive Change" that exacts a visible price or sacrifice. The backstory about the rebellion explains the context but doesn't create immediate obstacles in the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the rusted spaceport and the ancient stone circle creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. Sensory details like "ozone and wildflowers" work well to ground the scene. However, some descriptors lean into cliché ("groaned under the weight of forgotten time," "whispering secrets"), which blunts the distinctiveness of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story lacks immediate active opposition; the conflict is primarily historical (the failed rebellion) rather than present in the bay. The escalation consists of Lira walking closer to the stones as the hum gets louder, which is a progression of intensity but not complexity or risk. Without an obstacle or a moment where she almost turns back, the stakes feel low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of neglected magic vs. exhausted rebellion is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed summary ("The rebellion had failed because it had forgotten its own magic"). The ending relies on explicit statement of the moral rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the imagery and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable melancholic tone. However, the POV creates distance by summarizing emotions ("she felt something like hope") instead of embodying them. There are moments of "telling" that filter the experience, such as the direct explanation of the "thunderous serenity" description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but relies on "creative writing" stock phrases ("spilled mercury," "thrummed in her bones," "secrets to the wind"). While rhythmically competent, the writing lacks the freshness and density required for higher bands, often using adjectives to do the work of strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise of mixing sci-fi ruins with druidic magic is appealing but handled with standard tropes (the chosen heir reawakening the power). The execution is safe and linear, missing an opportunity to subvert the expectation that the magic would simply wait for someone to touch it.</comment>
