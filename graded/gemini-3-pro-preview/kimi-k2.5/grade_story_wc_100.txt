<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marian is a compelling focalizer whose professional worldview ("dignity of soil-bound death") authentically colors her perception of the surreal. Her motivation is singular and drives the narrative to a decisive renunciation of her former life, though the trait "inadvertently stubborn" relies on expository telling rather than dramatized friction to justify the delay and the climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative operates on a cohesive dream logic where the "impossible space" functions as a valid mechanism for the genre, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is distinct and earned: Marian’s transition from undertaker to librarian carries a palpable conceptual cost (the abandonment of the surface world) that lands with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater library is realized with exceptional sensory specificity, from "books floating like schools of silver fish" to the "liquid stone" of the stairs. The setting actively constrains and shapes the narrative logic, transforming a generic descent into a structured architectural experience that grounds the magical realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central deepening—realizing the dead are displaced rather than in pain—effectively reweights the stakes, but the external pressure is mild; the environment yields to Marian with "the gentleness of a sheet," offering little physical resistance. The narrative acts more as a ritual of alignment than a conflict of opposing forces, limiting the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of providing a "permanent address" for the displaced dead offers a sophisticated, non-moralizing exploration of memory and rest. The concept of "frequencies of forgetting" and the lens focusing location instead of light integrates perfectly with the plot, delivering a resonant answer to the central dramatic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident and atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical consistency that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. The control of psychic distance is steady, though the self-conscious repetition of the phrase "inadvertently stubborn" briefly breaks the immersion by drawing attention to the construction of the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is generally dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("compression between pressure and memory"). However, the verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "inadvertently stubborn" creates a noticeable scaffold artifact, and occasional phrases like "ocean opened like a wound" lean toward cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse lens, an undertaker, and an underwater library for the displaced dead is highly original and executed with freshness. The story successfully transforms standard ghost tropes into a novel architectural metaphor for stability and loss.</comment>
