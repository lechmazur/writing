<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is robust, with the protagonist's internal conflict between the safety of facts and the "mathematics of longing" driving the narrative. The "confidently uncertain" trait is dramatized effectively in the climax, showing a clear shift in values. A slight reliance on diagnostic interiority ("Marcus realized," "insulating emotionally") prevents the highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and tight, with a decisive closure (the choice to authenticate for mercy rather than truth) that reconfigures the protagonist's stance. The inciting incident and climax are clearly defined, and the ending lands with a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that feels earned and final.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of the quarry trailer is masterfully integrated, functioning as both a physical insulation and a metaphorical echo chamber for the protagonist's past. The "limestone swallowed sound" imagery charges the final beat, making the environment indispensable to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly braided: the boy's financial desperation against Marcus's need for professional redemption and emotional safety. The pressure escalates coherently when the boy enters, forcing a binary choice. The cost—abandoning the "right answer" that Marcus clung to for sanity—is felt, though primarily internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of resonance versus verification is powerful and organic to the premise. However, the score is capped by a "thematic echo" in the denouement ("Marcus realized, value wasn't in the verification but in the resonance"), which explicitly states the subtext rather than letting the final action carry it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical roadie jargon with melancholic reflection. The tone is consistent. There is a minor loss of immediacy due to filter verbs ("He felt," "He realized") which distances the reader slightly during peak emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is evocative with strong imagery ("metallic ghost," "calcified memory"), but suffers from filter-verb stacks ("Marcus felt," "Marcus found himself," "He realized") that blunt the impact. The "insulating emotionally with facts" phrase is a purposeful repetition, but the explicit analysis of feelings in the final third tells more than it shows.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—an ex-roadie turned disgraced Antiques Roadshow-style appraiser hiding in a quarry—is highly original and specific. The synthesis of rock nostalgia with the cold taxonomy of appraisal creates a fresh, compelling angle on the theme of loss.</comment>
