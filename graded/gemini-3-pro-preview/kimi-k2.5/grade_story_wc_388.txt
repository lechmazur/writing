<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characterization is functional but relies on summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure; Mara's "trembling hands" are a stock cue rather than embodied emotion. Her interaction with the settlers is narrated from a distance ("Mara stood her ground... She explained"), preventing any deep exploration of her internal conflict or social stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a significant causality break: paper letters surviving in a compost bin for years (a "pre-liquidation" era) to be legible for reassembly strains physical credibility. The resolution is a "push-button" fix where the machine works instantly, resolving the crisis without a felt cost or meaningful complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard offers vivid imagery ("iron-skinned apple trees," "amber dust"), but the world logic falters with the compost-bin discovery. While the visual atmosphere is established, the setting details function more as a backdrop than as constraints that force specific tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The central conflict with the settlers is handled through exposition and summary rather than a dramatized scene with active opposition. The stakes are high in theory (survival), but the lack of on-page resistance or the risk of failure flattens the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the protagonist articulating the thesis in the final paragraphs ("replace it with something more durable: comprehension"). This didactic approach resolves the theme through assertion rather than through the subtext of the action, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on "telling" traits ("sharply observant enough to notice") rather than showing them through unique perception. The repetition of the phrase "sharply observant" three times disrupts the flow and feels like a forced insertion of a required element.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is marred by repetitive phrasing (e.g., "screaming mouth... storms screaming" in the same sentence) and the triple use of the awkward "sharply observant" tag. The prose frequently summarizes key moments that should be scenes, reducing immediacy and impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "science disguised as magic" premise is a familiar trope executed here with standard beats and no subversive twist. While the "stillpoint" concept has potential, the execution follows a predictable debunking procedural without adding fresh emotional or conceptual depth.</comment>
