<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific expertise and coping mechanism (theatrical narration) create a distinct presence. However, the explicit labeling of her trait ("thoughtfully spirited") in the narration weakens the show-don't-tell discipline, and her internal arc lacks a moment of sharp, contradictory struggle; she executes a plan rather than wrestling with a dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and effectively structures the single scene from mundane preparation to significant departure. The closure (placing the bookmark in the sphere) acts as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the progression feels somewhat linear and inevitable rather than driven by surprising causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "fragile grammar of drips" and "frost-laced window" create a vivid, tactile sense of place. The setting actively constrains the timeline (melting ice bridges), integrating the environment deeply into the plot's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The environmental pressure (melting ice) provides a clear clock, but the stakes feel largely thematic rather than urgent on the page. The character's agency is exercised in *how* she leaves rather than *if*, resulting in a "surrender" that fits the tone but lacks high-tension narrative torque.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of preservation amidst transition is handled with sophistication, merging the literal ice cores with the glass spheres. While some thematic resonance is slightly overstated in the narration ("thawing heart was not merely metaphor"), the final image effectively unifies the concept without a moralizing sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, suiting the "contemplative" protagonist. The theatrical dialogue ("Exit, pursued by spring") is risky but executed with enough conviction to serve the character's stated method, though it occasionally borders on performative artifice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. However, the intrusion of prompt-labeling phrases ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully spirited") in the narration disrupts immersion, and occasional metaphors like the sun "bleeding" feel less fresh than the surrounding imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of glassblowing and glacial science creates a novel and memorable specific setting. The premise of crafting "transparent shelters" for melting history offers a fresh angle on the cli-fi/preservation trope, distinguishing the piece from standard survivor narratives.</comment>
