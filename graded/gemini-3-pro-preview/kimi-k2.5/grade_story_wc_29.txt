<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elena is a competent, proactive protagonist who drives the action. Her expertise is established well through specific actions (tracing charts, patching generators), but her internal landscape is somewhat generic ("fear coiling," "hands trembled"). The emotional arc is functional rather than deeply idiosyncratic; she fits the "capable scientist" archetype without subverting it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causality is strong, with a clear ticking clock (17 minutes) and a logical progression of beats. The setup of the "tricksters" and the specific counter-measure pays off cleanly at the climax. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is distinct—the immediate threat ends, but the community remains "fractured," earning the cost of the conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The setting is grounded effectively; the radio station feels lived-in with "ancient equipment" and "sodium light." The use of the window to observe the town's chaos allows the exterior stakes to pressure the interior scene without breaking the single location. The specific sensory details ("dust motes," "ozone") build a solid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly established (town/civilization survival) and escalate appropriately as the window closes. The antagonist's counter-move ("pressure like thumbs") adds necessary resistance, though the resolution comes relatively easily via technical adjustment. The cost is physical exhaustion and damaged gear, which feels slightly light for "wrestling gods."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of human resilience vs. manufactured discord is legible and resonant. However, the story tends to state its themes explicitly ("making humans destroy each other") rather than letting them emerge purely through subtext. The final image of the "unnatural division" ceasing lands the concept well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a tone that balances scientific competence with cosmic dread. The POV remains firmly with Elena, filtering observations through her expertise. The transition from technical problem-solving to high-stakes action is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose is functional but relies on some clichés ("swirling like galaxies," "fear coiling," "clenched fists"). Crucially, the literal insertion of prompt phrases ("ethereal grit of the moment," "cautiously hopeful" repeated verbatim) breaks immersion and reads as a checklist rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—a radio operator fighting cosmic entities—is a familiar genre trope executed competently but without a surprising twist or fresh angle. The "subsonic frequency" solution is standard technobabble. It succeeds as a genre exercise but lacks a unique conceptual spark.</comment>
