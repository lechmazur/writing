<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation is clear, but interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("lesson in vulnerability," "deepest motivation was not survival") rather than embodied experience. This abstraction creates emotional distance during pivotal moments of decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, with a clear orientation and a decisive closure unit (releasing the bird, descending the stairs) that carries visible cost. The logic of the "dust mote" navigation method is fantastical but consistent within the established lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the skylight and dust motes aren't just atmospheric but functionally drive the protagonist's method. Sensory details like "foxing paper" and "pigeon feed" ground the attic effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are high and the escalation is well-handled; the pressure of the closing-in paper trails forces a clear, costly trade-off. The final choice to sacrifice the artifact and reveal herself is a strong, earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit summary statements ("preserved by flight instead of hoarding") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The moralizing tone at the end flattens the resonance of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("impossible warmth," "fragment of forgotten stories"). The narrative distance is generally controlled, keeping focus on Elara's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is marred by awkward phrasing ("Across learning to trust again" is syntactically jarring) and repetitive use of the "blooming withering" motif. These artifacts disrupt the reading flow and distract from the otherwise competent prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a pigeon trainer, a Mars meteorite, and a bookshop setting offers a fresh, specific premise. The execution successfully blends these disparate elements into a cohesive, if slightly melodramatic, whole.</comment>
