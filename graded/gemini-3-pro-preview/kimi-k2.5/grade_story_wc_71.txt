<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya is a competent observer but lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her journey is frictionless; she wants to understand and succeeds immediately without personal cost or difficult choices. The label "creeping normality noticer" tells rather than shows her psychological makeup through pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear progression of discovery with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the house wakes), but the "shard of hush" functions as a convenient MacGuffin found without struggle. The causality is soft; the protagonist faces no setbacks or complications that force a change in tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like the "copper light," "driftwood fence posts," and "violet-scented" root. The atmosphere of magical realism is sustained and successfully creates a mood of hushed expectancy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes are low and abstract; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure to generate tension. The escalation is merely spatial (moving closer to the house) rather than narrative; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment or her own limitations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is intriguing but heavily explicated through summary ("The houses weren't haunted; they were listening") rather than subtext. The final paragraph includes a direct thematic echo ("profound truths often arrive disguised..."), which flattens the resonance into a moral statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but relies too heavily on filter verbs ("She had come to understand," "She saw") and explanatory interiority. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("crystallized absence of sound") that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished but dense with adjectives and slightly strained metaphors ("streetlights daydreamed," "grammar of rearrangement"). While the imagery is evocative, the reliance on abstraction ("fragment of primordial stillness") reduces immediate physical grounding in the key scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central concept of "creeping normality" applied to sentient houses moving furniture is imaginative and fresh. While the execution leans into "wonder tale" tropes without conflict, the premise itself offers a unique angle on the haunted house genre.</comment>
