<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya functions as a competent archetype rather than a character under pressure; she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful blind spots. Her motivation is abstract ("equations for hope") rather than visceral, and she faces no moment where her competence fails her, resulting in a protagonist who solves rather than struggles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear procedural path (survey, fix, succeed) without a decisive turning point where failure is a genuine risk. The closure is a "victory lap" that lacks the required legible cost; the transformation is achieved through summary rather than a dramatic pivot that forces a tradeoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of carnival detritus (popcorn, pumps) against the sterile, abandoned spaceport architecture creates a vivid, textured atmosphere. The setting actively provides the tools for resolution, grounding the high-concept premise in specific, tactile details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent as the environment yields to Maya's efforts without resistance; the machinery is "dormant" rather than recalcitrant. There is no escalation of pressure, only a progression of tasks, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed expository narration ("grammar of sustenance," "hope... was a pressure differential") rather than subtext. The story lectures the reader on its meaning instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from significant psychic distancing, relying on filter verbs ("she perceived," "she felt") to summarize emotion. The narrative prioritizes poetic observation over immediate sensory immersion in the physical labor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished but frequently slips into abstraction ("mathematically precise silence") and metaphorical summary that glosses over the mechanics of the scene. While the imagery is strong, the reliance on high-level descriptors blunts the scene's momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The Solarpunk premise of repurposing high-tech ruin for agriculture is appealing, but the execution is safe and devoid of narrative risk. The story reads like a vignette or a concept piece rather than a fully dramatized narrative with human stakes.</comment>
