<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, but her internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("bravely conflicted," "moral crisis") rather than embodied struggle. The pivotal decision is rushed through a transition phrase ("within the blink..."), eliding the psychological processing of the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (whistleblower awaiting arrest) is a valid Decisive Change with clear cost. However, the sudden availability of "dormant networks" and the swift transition from hesitation to action undercut the earned difficulty of the choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sensory details of the cold are effective ("breath frosting," "subzero"), but the verbatim repetition of the setting tag ("echoing library under snow") three times makes the atmosphere feel formulaic rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly communicated; the shift from preservation to treason carries a tangible price (security alarms, erasure). The conflict is resolved through a definitive action, though the opposition (security) arrives only after the deed is done.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of frozen truth vs. liquid revelation is consistent but handled with a heavy hand ("preservation became provocation"). The message is delivered through explicit statements rather than emerging organically from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The voice is elevated and consistent but suffers from the mechanical insertion of required phrases, which disrupts the natural flow. Phrases like "bravely conflicted" and "scandalize the capital" feel pasted in rather than voiced from within the character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is marred by excessive verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases ("dangerous liaison letter" x4, "echoing library under snow" x3, "dizzying quiet" x3). This creates a distracting loop effect that significantly hampers line-level quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist discovering a fake war is a standard dystopian trope. The execution follows a predictable path without a fresh twist on the concept or a unique stylistic approach.</comment>
