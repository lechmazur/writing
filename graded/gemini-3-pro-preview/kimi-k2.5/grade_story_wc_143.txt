<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clearly delineated, rooting her professional duty in a personal legacy (the grandfather). Her choice to endure the hypothermic risk for the sake of the image demonstrates embodied agency, though the "purposefully curious" attribute feels slightly imposed rather than organic to her internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Situation/Accumulative drive, using the countdown to dawn effectively to build pressure. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical site is lost but the data is archived—lands with earned cost (the physical ordeal and the melancholy of loss). Causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Specificity is excellent; the use of potassium ferricyanide and the fusion-glass veins grounds the sci-fi setting in tangible chemistry and geology. The sensory details of the "dawning hush" and the "cathedral of gold" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that directly constrains the protagonist's actions (temperature/light).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and elevated by the physical threat of the -170 degree temperature and the encroaching drills. The conflict is primarily Man vs. Time/Nature, which works well for the scope. The cost is felt in her physical suffering and the irreversible loss of the landscape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of preservation against corporate erasure is coherent but delivered somewhat explicitly ("The image would show humanity what they had destroyed"). The final sentiment—a "love letter written in oxidation"—leans toward sentimental over-articulation, slightly reducing the resonant power of the image itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent, somewhat lyrical register appropriate for the "last witness" tone. The narrative distance is well-managed, zooming in on the tactile work with the chemicals and out to the broader context of Earth and the colony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good density ("razor-thin crescent"), but the required phrase "purposefully curious" appears twice in a way that feels mechanical. Phrasing like "mechanical predators" approaches cliché, but the technical descriptions of the chemical process balance this well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "witness to extinction" on a celestial body is a familiar sci-fi trope. However, the specific integration of the chemical time-capsule and the grandfather's sand grain adds a layer of specific texture that elevates it above a generic execution.</comment>
