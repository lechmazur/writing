<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya accepts the ghost's nature instantly without skepticism or visceral reaction, making her emotional grounding feel thin. The relationship with Elias develops entirely in summary ("weekly tea sessions"), denying the reader the scene work where status dynamics or genuine connection would be dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative spans months via montage ("ritual began the following Tuesday," "fourth meteor shower"), violating the immediate scope required for effective short fiction. This summary mode dissolves tension and distances the reader from the pivotal causal moments of her learning process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sensory details of the building ("grooves... alphabetical," "radiators in dead tongues") are vivid and effectively ground the magical premise. The setting actively participates in the narrative logic, serving as both obstacle and eventual ally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is low-stakes; Maya's goal is intellectual, and she faces no significant opposition or cost of failure before the ghost mentor resolves it for her. The solution is given rather than earned through a painful trade-off or risky choice on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of architecture as language is coherent and poetic, anchored by the "agreed upon lies" motif. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by the ease of Maya's integration—she learns the language without sacrificing anything significant for it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a "mysterious familiarity" throughout. However, the reuse of distinctive phrases like "agreed upon lies" and "patiently nimble" within a short space breaks the immersive spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetition of specific phrases ("patiently nimble" twice, "agreed upon lies" three times, "interrogate" three times) creates a stuttering effect in such a short text. The second use of "patiently nimble" is abstract and reads like a forced constraint insertion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of reading a building's history is imaginative, but the execution relies on the familiar "magical mentor" trope without subversion. The resolution feels safe and cozy rather than offering a fresh or challenging synthesis.</comment>
