<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is a competent focalizer with a distinct skill set, but she lacks internal contradiction or a dilemma that forces a difficult choice. The resolution relies on her procedural expertise without exacting a personal or emotional cost, making her feel more like a function of the plot than a fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the acoustic diagnosis to the resolution, and the closure lands effectively with a tangible change in the world. However, the progression is strictly linear, lacking a significant reversal or a moment where the plan fails, which reduces narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful, with details like "stalactites humming in D-minor" and the "cracks in ice" acting as a functional meter for the magic system. The environment is not just a backdrop but the primary tool Mara uses to resolve the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>External stakes are high (survival against psychic noise), but the conflict is resolved through steady application of skill rather than a desperate struggle or trade-off. The lack of a "crucible" moment where Mara must sacrifice something to succeed limits the dramatic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of silence not as emptiness but as a "hammered repose" creates a resonant thematic finish that elevates the story beyond a simple problem-solution structure. The focus on the weight and texture of peace provides a satisfying conceptual repricing at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending technical acoustic terminology with mythic resonance ("screaming tempest," "legendary bloom"). While atmospheric, the narrative distance sometimes feels slightly detached, summarizing Mara's realizations rather than immersing the reader in her immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, successfully carrying the story's heavy imagery, though it occasionally leans into adjectival clusters ("gently luminous," "soft blue-green") and expository bridges ("Mara understood then"). The rhythm generally supports the "tempest to silence" arc well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic science, geology, and magical realism offers a fresh perspective on the "post-invasion" trope. The specific mechanism of reading ice fractures to tune a sonic weapon is an ingenious detail that grounds the magic in physical reality.</comment>
