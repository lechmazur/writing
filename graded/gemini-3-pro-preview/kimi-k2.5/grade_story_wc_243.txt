<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, competent focalizer whose internal landscape effectively grounds the speculative elements. The emotional arc lands a strong Earned Stasis, where her endurance of the "terrible joy" feels motivated and consistent. A slight reliance on abstract emotional labeling ("frequencies only the bereaved could hear") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear ritualistic structure that aligns perfectly with an Accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the locket's value—lands with conceptual weight. The "physics" explanation provides a slightly expository bump, but causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the mnemonic flowers and the specific interaction of ink and salt spray are the mechanism of the story. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's ritual and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ standard for functional setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are high (the collapse of the covenant), but the immediate pressure is largely atmospheric and navigated with high competence, reducing on-page tension. The "misstep" danger is articulated but remains a background concern rather than an escalating active obstacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The themes of entropy, memory, and the "physics of grief" are woven tightly into the action without feeling sermonizing. The ending recontextualizes the fading photograph not as a failure but as a mercy, offering a sophisticated thematic repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, suiting the archivist persona well. There is a minor reliance on filter verbs ("She felt it," "Mara felt the haunted euphoria") that occasionally creates unnecessary psychic distance during visceral moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with evocative sensory details like "tannin and rain." However, the density of figurative language in the second half ("dissolved... like wet sugar," "frequencies") occasionally slows momentum and leans toward overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of walnut ink archiving with a "physics of proximate causes" magic system is fresh and memorable. The story transforms standard ghost tropes into a unique bureaucratic ritual that feels distinct and original.</comment>
