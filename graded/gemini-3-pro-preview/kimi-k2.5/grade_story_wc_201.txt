<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the story's extended metaphors than as a living character. Heavy reliance on diagnostic label-speak (e.g., "trauma responses," "somatic memory," "proprioceptive map") in peak beats creates clinical distance rather than embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, successfully navigating a surreal logic to a legible Conceptual Repricing ending. However, the progression is linear and lacks significant causal turns; the stakes remain theoretical until the final resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly described and establishes a strong, consistent atmosphere suitable for the surreal premise. However, the setting functions primarily as a static projection of the protagonist's psyche rather than an environment that offers concrete resistance or tactical resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conflict remains internal and abstract; the "pressure" is generated by the setting's passive demands rather than active opposition or difficult choices. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a struggle that forces a visible trade-off or tactical pivot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thematic statements to convey meaning, culminating in a literal "formula" for forgiveness in the final paragraph. This didactic approach violates the "show, don't tell" principle, summarizing the insight rather than letting it emerge from the drama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a high-register, quasi-scientific tone throughout. However, the density of jargon and abstract phrasing creates a "pane of glass" effect that keeps the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor congestion (e.g., "roots dangling with the silverware of her suffering"). Coherence issues arise from contradictory imagery (seeing "invisible" wavelengths vs. navigating by proprioception), and the density of abstract nouns hampers narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of math, torture, and nature is imaginatively weird, offering a fresh conceptual landscape. However, the execution leans heavily on "trauma plot" tropes and pseudo-profound assertions, making it feel more like a theoretical exercise than a lived story.</comment>
