<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—seeking the "frequency of finality" before her own appointment—creates a compelling, high-stakes internal crucible. The shift from rigid desperation to "holding loosely" is earned through the tactile, specific action of trawling, resulting in a resonant internal change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the discovery of the shoe crystalizes the protagonist's shift in perspective with clear conceptual cost (the loss of certainty). The narrative arc is coherent under the Accumulative lens, moving smoothly from seeking to understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral and vivid; the "drift-ice marina" and "industrial gray" create a sensory pressure that mirrors the protagonist's liminal state. The environment actively constrains the action, forcing her to use the parasol tip to navigate the debris, thus charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are existential and clear; the contrast between the mass casualty event and the scheduled clinic appointment generates sustained tension. The climax (finding the shoe) effectively reweights the dominant stake (control over death) without resolving into a tidy happy ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "ending as tending" is poignant, though the explicit definition of the "fold in patience" leans slightly into expositional telling. The resolution successfully avoids a simple binary, embracing a complex, open-ended acceptance that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, ethereal, and appropriately detached, matching the "half-unmoored" protagonist perfectly. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to her specific, altered perception without slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric ("specific frequency of finality"), maintaining high density. A few images, like bergs groaning "like old men," feel slightly standard compared to the otherwise fresh specificities, and the "filigree tattoo" is borderline overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism and disaster relief is striking and fresh, elevating the "learning to die" trope into something specific and new. The use of the parasol tip as a pragmatic tool grounds the high concept in tactile reality.</comment>
