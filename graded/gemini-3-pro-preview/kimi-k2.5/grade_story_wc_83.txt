<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amara is a compelling protagonist driven by a specific, grief-fueled obsession that feels earned and urgent. Her internal landscape is vivid, though the emotion is occasionally labeled ("bleak exhilaration") rather than fully dramatized through action alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with a clear goal and ticking clock that drives momentum effectively. However, the interface between the geode and the navigation console relies on "magic rock" logic that strains the otherwise grounded hard sci-fi setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with tactile specificity, contrasting the cold mechanics of the station with the organic warmth of the geode. The sensory details of the cooling systems and the visual of Earth’s curvature ground the scene well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tension is maintained and escalated expertly through the cooling circuit breakers, creating a tangible countdown. The cost is palpable—Amara trades safety for a desperate hunt—and the pressure forces a decisive closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of potentiality and loss is poignant, but the prompt-required phrases ("unfiltered awakening," "intangibly tangible") feel inserted rather than organic. This over-explicitness flattens the subtext of an otherwise resonant concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific precision with poetic longing effectively. The POV remains tightly anchored in Amara’s perception, filtering the world through her obsession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong and dense, but the forced inclusion of specific prompt phrases results in clunky modifications ("intangibly tangible weight"). The technical descriptions occasionally drift into jargon without sufficient clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept—using mathematics to hunt the quantum residue of unlived lives—is a fresh and imaginative synthesis of sci-fi and metaphysical tropes. It transforms a standard revenge setup into something more philosophical and distinct.</comment>
