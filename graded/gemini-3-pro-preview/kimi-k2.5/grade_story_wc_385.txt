<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's primary trait is established via the diagnostic label "richly perceptive" rather than dramatized observation. Her motivation regarding her sister is clear, but the emotional reality is often summarized ("perception ached") rather than embodied in interaction until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal line to a Conceptual Repricing closure ("seeds" not "prisoners"), but the climax relies heavily on an "explain-everything" exposition dump by the Archivists. The revelation is delivered rather than earned through struggle, though the final choice is distinct.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; imagery like "braided together like arteries of stone" and "decision crystallizing like gypsum" grounds the metaphysical concept. The specific acoustic geometry of the setting effectively constrains the magic and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the antagonists (Archivists) function as gatekeepers who immediately step aside and explain the plot ("You carry the resonance key"). There is no active opposition or rising pressure on the page; the stakes are high in concept but low in immediate dramatic execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory as preservation versus exploitation is coherent and resolves clearly in the final choice ("echo became choice, not capture"). However, the thematic pivot is delivered through explicit dialogue and exposition rather than emerging organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic/lyrical tone ("reed-blown melancholy"), but it is noticeably disrupted by the awkward, verbatim insertion of prompt phrases like "progressive disclosure" which clash with the established diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows strong sensory control and rhythmic sentence structure ("hummed... a vibration she felt in her teeth"). However, the "scaffold" visibility of required elements creates distinct prose artifacts that mar the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of geological time and human consciousness is a compelling concept. While the "secret society" trope is standard, the specific execution through acoustic resonance and canyon imagery offers a fresh aesthetic layer.</comment>
