<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara displays absolute competence without internal contradiction or struggle, which flattens the dramatic tension. The ghost functions primarily as a plot dispenser who capitulates instantly, failing to apply genuine pressure to her character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative flow is logical, but the pivotal deduction—connecting the snow globe to a stowaway child—relies on a convenient intuitive leap rather than earned evidence. Closure is achieved, but the investigative "Sherlock scan" feels rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct; the "shrine carved into glacier ice" and the specific details of the "obsidian altar" ground the fantasy effectively. The atmospheric specificity is the story's strongest technical element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conflict is low-voltage; the antagonist offers a single line of warning before surrendering to the evidence. The stakes remain abstract (historical correction) and lack immediate, visceral cost for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit telling; phrases like "purity of your choice" and "reconstruct the story not as tragedy, but as redemption" dictate the interpretation rather than allowing it to emerge from the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, though it occasionally veers into melodrama ("motivation burned brighter"). The tone supports the Gothic mystery vibe well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("voice like cracking ice," "tear tracks") and abstract telling ("wove truth carefully"). Adjective-heavy descriptions occasionally stall the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core concept—solving shipwrecks by analyzing "cameo appearances" in the dreams of descendants—is inventive and fresh. This original mechanism elevates an otherwise standard ghost story structure.</comment>
