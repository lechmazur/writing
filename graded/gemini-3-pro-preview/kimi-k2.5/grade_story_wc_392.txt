<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya’s internal conflict between the mentor’s training and her intuition is legible and drives the scene, fulfilling the requirement for contradictory impulses. However, the backstory of the "controlling influence" is summarized rather than dramatized, and the shift from suppression to liberation relies heavily on exposition ("entangled memories she had spent years trying to compartmentalize") rather than purely embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure—choosing to write the report with her own conclusions—is a valid Decisive Change that lands with cost (severing the mentor's legacy). However, the plot pivots on a convenient discovery (the "waterproof satchel" containing the damning reports), which bypasses the need for the protagonist to deduce the crime solely through the forensic evidence available in the tunnel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The atmospheric details are strong, with the drought-hardened mud and the Victorian tunnel creating a distinct, pressurized environment. The sensory work is specific (squelching boots, patina, vibration), though the "miraculously" unbroken glass is an authorial intrusion that breaks the grounded tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (truth vs. institutional silence), and the pressure escalates coherently from the body discovery to the decision to report. The cost is primarily internal/relational (the final break from the mentor), which is felt, though the external antagonist (the transit authority) remains abstract and off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story relies on a heavy-handed thematic summary in the final paragraph ("After the drought ends, the ground reveals what it has hidden"), which violates the show-don't-tell preference for resonance. The symbolism of the lantern is functional but explicit ("like a talisman"), reducing the potential for subtler subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for an investigator, maintaining a close third-person perspective. However, it occasionally slips into abstract labeling ("fortified vulnerability," "controlling influence") to satisfy prompt requirements, which distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases that disrupt syntax and logic (e.g., "fortified vulnerability manifesting as deliberate breaths"). Additionally, phrase repetition ("recognized... recognition") and abstract noun clusters ("cascade of entangled memories") reduce line-level momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise of a "post-drought forensic archaeologist" is engaging, but the narrative arc—the student overcoming the cold mentor to find their own moral voice—is a standard trope executed safely here. The "evil corporation left a paper trail in a satchel" element lacks ingenuity.</comment>
