<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The protagonist serves as a passive vessel for the concept, defined by habitual actions ("would touch," "moved") rather than specific choices under pressure. The internal arc is summarized as a state of being rather than dramatized through agency in a present-tense scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a static vignette rather than a causal story; there is no inciting incident in the present timeline to disrupt the status quo. Closure relies on a summarized realization ("understanding finally") that feels like a restatement of the premise rather than an earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is the piece's standout feature, anchoring the abstract premise in vivid, tactile specificity ("salt wind," "grain," "barnacle"). The sensory environment of the container city effectively constrains the character's reality and defines the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and static throughout; there is no escalation, tightening of options, or new cost paid on the page. The tension is a constant textural state rather than a rising conflict that forces a decision or change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is collapsed by explicit thesis statements ("memory was not recollection but accretion") that explain the subtext directly to the reader. The ending relies on sermonizing the moral rather than allowing the final image to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, fitting the contemplative "archivist" persona well. It maintains a controlled, melancholic distance that suits the theme of erasure, though it occasionally risks monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high textural density ("old bruises," "corrugated steel"). While some phrasing leans toward abstract overwriting ("negative space," "neural map"), the line-level craft effectively supports the sensory focus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of bureaucratic undeath processed through synesthesia is imaginative and engaging. However, the execution falls into a "static portrait" mode common in concept-first writing, lacking the narrative drive to make it a complete story.</comment>
