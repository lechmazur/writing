<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s internal landscape is compelling, filtering climate grief through the specific lens of her "fault-tolerant" trade. The transition from feverish uncertainty to cold, culpable realization is earned by the interior causality, though the "oracle" persona occasionally risks distancing the reader from her raw physical state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving seamlessly from the fever breaking to the discovery of the illustration. The closure is excellent: taping the anomaly to the center of the log is a Decisive Change that undeniably reconfigures her stance and accepts the cost of complicity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The botanical specifics—"woolly stars," "alpine scree"—ground the story beautifully. However, the atmosphere occasionally tips into pathetic fallacy with phrases like "auroral sorrow," which feel more imposed by the author than observed by the character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stakes escalate effectively from a professional data-quality concern to a profound moral crisis. The pressure is coherent, driven by the tangible evidence of the illustration, forcing a choice between continued comfort in the margins or confronting the catastrophic center.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central theme of denial-as-fault-tolerance is powerful, but the text trusts the reader too little, explicitly diagnosing the theme ("It was the weight of complicity...") rather than letting the subtext carry the weight. The final paragraph's equation of sorrow with charged particles is over-articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and authoritative, blending scientific lexicon with a mythic tone. At times, however, the register becomes too elevated ("hollowed and luminous"), prioritizing poetic texture over the immediate urgency of the discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While often vivid, the prose suffers from adjectival stacking ("auroral sorrow," "bruised purple") and occasional mixed metaphors. The line "Swaying certainties rocked her" is particularly clunky, forcing an abstract concept into a physical action in a way that disrupts the scene's gravity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of data science terminology with climate collapse is ingenious and fresh. Framing the denial of global warming as an algorithm's "fault tolerance" offers a sharp, original angle on a familiar subject.</comment>
