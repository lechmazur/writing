<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara is functionally competent but lacks internal contradiction or a distinct personality beyond her role. Her motivation is clear, yet she faces no difficult micro-choices that force her to prioritize values or pay a personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and linear, but the resolution arrives without a significant trade-off or complicating cost. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—she seeks sound and achieves it—missing the "felt cost" required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sensory details of the silent world and the specific mechanics of the tree-instrument are vivid and grounding. The porcelain insulator and the texture of the wood grain effectively anchor the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tension is low as the primary obstacle is technical rather than antagonistic or internal. The success feels inevitable once the process begins, lacking a moment where failure is a genuine risk or a sacrifice is demanded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of healing trauma through empathy is consistent but articulated through explicit labels rather than subtext. The resonance is slightly dampened by the didactic naming of the concept ("empathy in motion").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mythic, reverent tone is well-sustained and suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the voice occasionally relies on repeating specific prompt phrases rather than varying the description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished but suffers from the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases like "symphonically minded" and "empathy in motion." These repetitions disrupt the natural flow and draw attention to the artifact rather than the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit of bowing a tree's stress cracks using an industrial relic is a fresh, specific image that elevates the familiar "silent world" trope. The synthesis of technology and nature in the method feels original.</comment>
