<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict is legible, and the shift from mourning to independence is coherent. However, the motivation is delivered via diagnostic telling ("The motivation burned in her chest: to translate..."), and the emotional turning point relies on abstract realizations rather than embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear beginning, middle, and end that adheres to a Situational drive lens. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, though the causal link between the ritual and the specific realization about the atmosphere feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the "tidal library" and "cloud-ocean" creating a strong, specific atmosphere that frames the narrative. The environment actively shapes the imagery and the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates consistently through the ritual, leading to a clear shift in stance. While the "cost" is primarily conceptual (shedding the old self), it is felt on the page and reconfigures the protagonist's future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of translating isolation into independence resonates well, and the recontextualization of the extinct species as the atmosphere offers a satisfying, non-literal resolution to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a high-lyric tone appropriate for the setting. The focus remains tightly on Mira, handling the surreal elements with narrative confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers significantly from verbatim repetition of prompt keywords ("atomically reflective" x3, "brittle awakening" x3, "tidal library" x3) within a short space. These artifacts disrupt the rhythm and create a "fill-in-the-blank" feel despite the otherwise strong imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stratospheric coral library with the concept of reincarnation memory is fresh and engaging. The resolution transforms the standard "lonely survivor" trope into something more ecological and atmospheric.</comment>
