<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is sharp and drives the central negotiation, creating a clear arc from scavenging to surrender. While her internal state is conceptually rich, it relies heavily on metaphorical summary ("sediment," "layers of compromise") rather than embodied reaction until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is crisp: the ghost’s refusal of the initial offering forces a higher-stakes trade, leading to a decisive reconfiguration of the protagonist’s state. The closure lands with a surreal but legible logic, satisfying the "chronologically confused" premise without confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The disposable camera wheel recording sound is a brilliant, specific anchor that grounds the surrealism. However, the environmental description occasionally drifts into generic abstraction ("defied physics," "gravity's logic") rather than leaning on sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The negotiation provides a distinct pressure point that escalates effectively when the safe currency (overheard stories) is rejected. The final cost—surrendering personal history for continuity—is felt and changes the character’s ontological status.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The exploration of regret and continuity is resonant, though the narrative tends to state its thesis explicitly ("negotiating not for peace but for continuity") rather than allowing the subtext to carry the weight of meaning entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like mode well. The shift in perspective at the end effectively mirrors the protagonist's temporal dislocation, merging form and content.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with striking imagery ("lullaby dissolved into static"), but suffers occasionally from adjectival stacking and abstract noun phrases ("temporal dissonance," "fractured stillness") that create distance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of bartering audio fragments with a past self on an aerial carousel is imaginative and distinct. The synthesis of the scavenger archetype with this specific temporal magic feels fresh and unforced.</comment>
