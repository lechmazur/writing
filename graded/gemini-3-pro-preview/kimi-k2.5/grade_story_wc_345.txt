<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara’s internal journey from mistrust to kinship is legible but smoothed over by rapid summary rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her emotional arc feels inevitable rather than earned by friction, as the ghost's instructions remove the burden of leadership decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the resolution relies on convenient supernatural instructions that bypass the need for human ingenuity or sacrifice. The leap from reading star charts to manually building a planetary shield is logically tenuous, lowering the sense of earned victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the twin suns and floating arches are vivid, creating a distinct visual identity for the setting. However, the presence of "sidewalks" in a crash-landing orchard breaks immersion, and the world-building leans heavily on standard soft sci-fi tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the ghost provides the solution immediately, and the council accepts the plan without debate, trade-off, or cost. While the stakes of survival are nominally high, the characters face no genuine opposition or dilemma, resulting in a low-tension procedural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly written out in the final chalk message ("Family takes care of family"), flattening potential resonance into a direct moral statement. This didactic thematic echo in the final beat replaces the work of the narrative, violating the show-don't-tell principle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent but stumbles significantly when integrating required phrases, leading to awkward syntax. The repetition of descriptors like "strange/strangely" and the clumsy insertion of the "timeframe" element detract from the otherwise competent tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Prose quality suffers from severe artifacts, including a tautological sentence in paragraph 5 ("messages that had appeared through messages") and the reuse of the unique phrase "brambled hope" in adjacent paragraphs. These slips, along with repetitive diction, disrupt the reading flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost engineer helping survivors is touching but is executed with a "cozy" safety that avoids narrative risk or complexity. The story adheres to a familiar formula where cooperation is instant and problems are solved by benevolent magic.</comment>
