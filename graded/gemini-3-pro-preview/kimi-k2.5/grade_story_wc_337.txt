<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is compelling, and the choice to break her own mask to better understand fracture adds significant depth to her character. The transformation from restorer to vessel is earned through the on-page work and the visible accumulation of silence. A minor flaw is the diagnostic nature of her dialogue ("Only a cracked vessel..."), which explicitly states her psychology rather than letting the subtext carry the weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows an impeccable Accumulative drive lens, building pressure through the rhythmic unweaving of knots and the intensifying starlight. The closure is a quintessential Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's state is fundamentally altered to resolve the tension. The causality of the transfer—unweaving the net to weave the silence into herself—is logic-tight and satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting acts as a dynamic constraint; the "sharpening" starlight and the physical weight of the silence create a tangible pressure cooker that forces the protagonist’s evolution. The sensory details—obsidian, salt, prismatic refraction—are distinct and actively charge the final image of Mira as the new "net."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are visceral and escalate steadily: releasing the spirits requires Mira to physically absorb their trauma. The cost is unmistakable and paid on the page, as she sacrifices her role as a mere restorer to become a permanent vessel for the silence. The conflict is internal and atmospheric but maintains high tension throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central metaphor of unweaving trauma to ground it is powerful and resolves in a resonant, non-literal image of containment. However, the thematic resonance is slightly dampened by the protagonist explicitly articulating the story's thesis in dialogue ("I needed to see what I was handling..."), which reduces the interpretive space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and lyrically consistent, maintaining a "lucid unrest" that perfectly suits the mythic subject matter. The close third-person perspective manages the balance between external action and internal reflection without head-hopping or breaks in tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative and dense, with strong imagery. However, the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases—specifically "tapestry needle," "accumulated silence," and "interlaced hush"—creates a repetitive drag that feels like keyword insertion rather than organic variation. These artifacts disrupt the otherwise smooth lyrical flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration with the concept of unweaving ghostly nets offers a fresh, specific take on the exorcism trope. The inversion of the net—from a trap to a method of release, and finally to the protagonist herself—demonstrates high conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
