<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ego death," "numbness") rather than embodied behavior. The emotional breakthrough at the climax feels unearned because the internal struggle is summarized through abstract realization rather than dramatized friction. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the philosophical concept than a living entity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (integration and stabilization) lands with a clear conceptual shift. However, the turning point relies on an epiphany ("Maya realized") rather than a pressure-forced tactic, weakening the causal chain. The inciting incident and resolution are legible, but the middle is largely expository debate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The floating rock setting effectively isolates the characters, but the background of "history rewriting itself" remains a generic visual effect until the very end. The environment lacks tactile granularity beyond the cold tissue and the glass jar; the "void" is a standard white-room trope that doesn't constrain specific choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high (existence vs. dissolution), but the conflict remains abstract and intellectual. The "custody battle" is framed as a philosophical negotiation summarized in narration rather than a tactical struggle with shifting advantages. The antagonist (the brain) functions as a plot device to deliver the thematic lesson.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but over-articulated, with the narrative explicitly explaining the meaning of events ("Maya understood now that to vivify the clone was to vivify herself"). Subtext is virtually absent, as the story functions as a parable that lectures the reader on its own thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but distant, utilizing an elevated, abstract register that keeps the reader removed from the visceral horror of the situation. The point of view filters the experience through high-concept analysis ("architecture of her own dissolving consciousness") rather than immediate sensory perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose suffers from density of abstraction and telling over showing, particularly in pivotal moments ("The transfer occurred not as replacement but as conversation"). Specific phrases like "method of complementary opposites" are inserted as clunky labels rather than woven into the action, stalling narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The interpretation of the "custody battle" as an internal struggle for integration between an ego-death survivor and her clone brain is a genuinely creative synthesis of the elements. The premise offers a fresh, psychological take on the prompt's sci-fi components, distinguishing it from standard genre fare.</comment>
