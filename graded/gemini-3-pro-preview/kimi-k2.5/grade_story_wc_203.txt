<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya is a distinct professional with a unique worldview ("ghosts as mechanical systems") that effectively grounds the fantasy. However, her competence is absolute and she faces no internal struggle or meaningful resistance, making the character arc feel static and low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear path that efficiently links the diagnosis to the resolution. However, the climax relies on a convenient magical fix ("crack sealed itself") rather than a costly trade-off, making the closure feel slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the "dust accumulation patterns" which function simultaneously as atmospheric texture and the pivotal investigative tool. The setting is integral to the plot, acting as a mechanical system that bridges the physical and spiritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent but low-stakes; the ghost is a waiting participant rather than an obstacle, and the conflict remains purely situational. There is no moment where failure feels possible, limiting the dramatic tension to a puzzle-solving level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of maintenance applied to the afterlife is cohesive and resonant, treating hauntings as "infrastructure running parallel." The ending successfully reframes the burden of seeing as a "buoyant" clarity, achieving a solid Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and textured, matching Maya’s professional detachment with precise diction. However, the verbatim repetition of the tag "skillfully observant" (three times) disrupts the immersion and reads as a prompt artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-density and lyrical, with strong imagery like the "expired confetti" and "gradients" of dust. The score is capped by the repetitive insertion of the phrase "skillfully observant," which creates a noticeable template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of treating hauntings as mechanical infrastructure issues is fresh and executed with ingenuity. The synthesis of circus history, horology, and elevator repair creates a unique and memorable conceptual frame.</comment>
