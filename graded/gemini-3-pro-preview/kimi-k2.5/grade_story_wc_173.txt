<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lys is a distinct, high-concept archetype whose motivation to "harvest echoes" drives the narrative effectively. However, her interiority is heavily filtered through stylized metaphors (e.g., "virginity a blade"), creating a poetic distance that keeps her emotional struggle slightly abstract despite the clear stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The single-scene arc is tightly structured around the "three minutes" constraint, creating effective narrative tension. Closure lands with a valid Decisive Change as she unlocks the memories, though the resolution mechanism ("untangling threads") relies on abstract magical logic rather than a gritty, causal trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and suffocating, utilizing the "silver courtyard" and "living ink" shadows to create a cohesive monochrome world. The sensory details of the cold and the "crystallized" nature of the memories effectively ground the fantastical elements in a tangible setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of memory versus oblivion is clear, and the pressure escalates appropriately with the time limit and the resistance of the threads. While the protagonist succeeds, the cost is primarily atmospheric and psychological ("terrifying sanctity") rather than a visceral price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of resistance through the preservation of memory is integrated well into the action, avoiding preachy exposition. The final image of the "thaw that must inevitably come" offers a resonant, non-literal expansion of the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent in its high-literary, baroque style, fitting the "courtesan" persona. However, the density of metaphorical descriptors—"verses," "sonnet," and "calligraphy" all appearing in the opening lines—occasionally feels overwrought and draws attention to the author's hand.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the rhythm is polished, the prose suffers from metaphor stacking (e.g., whetting a blade against a lullaby) and the conspicuous repetition of prompt phrases ("alarming serenity" and "bodily poetic" both appear twice). These artifacts and the dense "purple" descriptions hinder narrative immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dystopian memory-wiping empire with the specific, lyrical magic of "frozen time threads" feels fresh. The concept of a chaste courtesan rebelling by unlocking the past is a creative and specific angle on the resistance trope.</comment>
