<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias appears as a static sage figure who executes a plan without internal conflict, doubt, or contradictory impulses, violating the 9+ requirement for struggle. The "unspoken words" attribute is summarized via montage rather than dramatized in a high-pressure scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("For three weeks...") rather than a continuous scene, diluting immediate causal pressure. While the final tableau functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of resistance makes the outcome feel inevitable and the cost low.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "cobalt library" and "magnetic grotto" are vivid, specific, and successfully establish a fable-like tone. The setting acts as a necessary vantage point that enables the final image, fulfilling the requirement for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract (slowness vs. velocity) and lacks an antagonist or concrete obstacle to the plan's execution. The stakes are thematic rather than visceral, and the plan proceeds without a meaningful tightening or reversal of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the chess opening as "invitation" is resonant, effectively reweighting the concept of rebellion. However, the narrative explicitly preaches the moral ("A second thought is a seed"), reducing the subtextual power of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and confident, successfully sustaining the story's magical realist atmosphere. However, the high narrative distance and unrelenting elevated register keep the reader observing Elias rather than inhabiting his experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is lush but overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and metaphors ("trembling frequencies," "celestial geometries") that slows momentum. The reliance on list-like sentence structures to convey the town's inner lives creates a repetitive cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of the chess motif with the synchronized window displays is a genuinely fresh and striking visual concept. It transforms a standard community trope into a specific, ingenious image that lingers.</comment>
