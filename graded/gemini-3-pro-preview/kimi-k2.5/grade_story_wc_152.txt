<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct and compelling focalizer, her internal life perfectly synchronized with her external craft. The interplay between her "foolish" persona and her strategic brilliance creates a strong, sustained tension. The choice to reveal her true nature to the captain is a well-earned risk, though a slightly more visceral personal cost or moment of doubt would have pushed this to the very top of the band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving cleanly from observation to detection to decisive intervention. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "error" in the embroidery recontextualizes the entire scene as an act of counter-espionage. The logic of the "adjacent possibilities" holds firm, making the climax feel inevitable rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary tool of the protagonist's agency; the cobalt dome's acoustics and light filtration are essential to her method. The sensory details—"geometry" of footsteps, blue walls holding sound like a shell—are vivid and functional, grounding the abstract magic in concrete reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalate effectively through the ticking clock of the approaching frost and coup. While the tension is palpable, the antagonist (the conspiracy) remains somewhat abstract, and the captain’s swift acceptance of her intel resolves the immediate conflict a bit too smoothly to reach the highest band for pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story achieves exceptional thematic unity, seamlessly blending the act of embroidery with the concepts of silence, history, and political maneuvering. The final image of the candle preserving the "fragile border" between timelines offers a profound, non-literal resolution that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and highly specific to the character’s worldview, using terminology like "celestial thread-counts" to reinforce her perspective. The tone modulates perfectly between the aesthetic beauty of her work and the urgent danger of the coup, maintaining a consistent and engaging perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density without sacrificing momentum. Lines like "foolishness was architecture" and "stitching the negative space of treason" demonstrate mastery of craft. There are no scaffold artifacts or loops; the rhythm of the sentences mirrors the precise, measured action of the needle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of needlework, quantum "adjacent possibilities," and political espionage creates a fresh and memorable premise. The execution of the "map hidden in the error" trope is revitalized by the story's unique metaphysical logic, feeling both ingenious and earned within the established world.</comment>
