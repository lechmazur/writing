<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara functions as a noble archetype rather than a flawed individual under pressure; her traits are established via descriptors ("shrewdly innocent," "surgical precision") rather than revealed through difficult choices. Her motivation is abstractly stated in interiority ("graft new meaning") rather than dramatized through a struggle that carries visible personal cost. The characterization leans into the "helper" trope without sufficient internal contradiction or error to generate depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural path, successfully using the cast notes to build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("not stains but seeds"). While the structure is sound for a lyric vignette, the lack of immediate scene-level causality or active obstacles makes the progression feel static. The closure lands clearly as a shift in perspective, though the cost remains largely abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central detail of the plaster cast as a "desperate archive" of charcoal notes is excellent, specific, and grounding. However, atmospheric descriptors like "mist-clad atrium" and "copper light" feel slightly generic and gothic for the setting. The sensory details of the coral and the "burning copra shed" add necessary texture, lifting the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative lacks active opposition or escalation within the scene; the protagonist observes and reflects but faces no immediate tactical dilemma or trade-off. The pressure is entirely ambient (the war outside) rather than pressing against the glass to force a decision in the moment. The stakes are high in concept but low in dramatization, resulting in a static, contemplative beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of translation as healing is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on narrator assertions ("the truest translation") and explicit moralizing near the end ("The translator's work was never finished"). The resonance relies more on these summaries than on the subtext of the action itself, bordering on the "sermonizing ending" anti-pattern.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, using elevated poetic filters ("hallowed silence," "chemical surrender") that distance the reader from the raw reality of the field hospital. The prose often tells the reader how to feel about the scene rather than letting the stark details speak for themselves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished but dense with "purple" artifacts and strained metaphors ("breathing thing of vapor," "lotus-hearted ache"). The repetition of the prompt phrase "shrewdly innocent" feels mechanical rather than motivic. While the rhythm is smooth, the high adjective density and interpretive labeling reduce immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept—a child's cast covered in community messages serving as a map of trauma—is a brilliant, poignant, and highly original image that anchors the story. This specific invention elevates the piece significantly above standard war-zone vignettes, offering a fresh lens on the "healer" narrative.</comment>
