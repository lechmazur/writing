<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (penance) is clear and drives the scene, and her competence is established through specific sensory engagement. However, the "magnetic calm" somewhat flattens the internal struggle, reducing the sense of immediate emotional cost during the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a defined objective and ticking clock. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the resolution feels slightly mechanical in its efficiency, lacking a complication that forces a shift in tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout strength, effectively blending the industrial depot with coastal weather. The sensory hierarchy is tightly controlled through the protagonist's non-visual perspective, making the environment palpable and functional to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (ship safety, redemption), but the execution lacks significant on-page obstacles or escalating friction. The repair proceeds with "magnetic calm" and success, missing a moment where the protagonist must trade off resources or overcome a genuine failure state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming brokenness into guidance is coherent, but the ending explicitly summarizes the metaphor ("anchor... seabed of her guilt"). This direct statement of the moral in the final paragraph reduces resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The POV is strictly maintained, filtering the world effectively through touch and sound without slipping into visual shortcuts. The voice is consistent, though occasionally leans into slightly elevated descriptors ("synthetic sinew") that border on purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and sensory-rich, effectively conveying the technical magic. However, phrases like "organized chaos" and "mechanical heartbeat" are clichés that dull the otherwise specific imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central conceit—using water refraction to translate visual/light data into tactile sound for a blind mechanic—is a genuinely fresh and ingenious synthesis that elevates the standard "race to repair" trope.</comment>
