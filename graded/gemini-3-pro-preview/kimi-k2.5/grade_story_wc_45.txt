<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's pivot from skeptic to healer is compelling, grounded in the specific action of bone setting. However, the dialogue "I am a forgiving skeptic... I forgive us both" is overly diagnostic and self-aware for the moment, reading more like a thesis statement than natural speech under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the effigy discovery to the healing and rescue, with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The transition from the garden to finding the real girl relies on a slightly convenient magical mechanic ("the tooth knows"), but the structural unity remains solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific, blending the medical ("unnatural give of faerie cartilage") with the atmospheric ("iron and lilac"). The setting of the garden with "impossible geometries" effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal shift without feeling generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high—a child's life and a worldview—but the external conflict is relatively low as the changeling is compliant. The resolution feels slightly smooth, lacking a moment where the protagonist's new belief is tested by genuine resistance or risk of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The inversion of the changeling trope ("monsters could become midwives") is thematically rich. However, the story explicitly articulates its theme in narration and dialogue ("turn mistakes into constellations," "not just of the limb but of the rift"), reducing subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, successfully blending clinical detachment with wonder. It slips occasionally into "helpful narrator" mode, over-explaining the symbolic weight of actions immediately after they occur, which distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery is generally strong, but there are text artifacts like the repetition of "shrewdly innocent" and scaffolded explanations of metaphors. Phrases like "cleft in certainty" lean toward purple prose, slightly obscuring the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of treating a changeling with medical mercy rather than violence is highly original and executed with specific, grounded details. The "bone setting" motif transforms a familiar folklore trope into something fresh and meaningful.</comment>
