<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is vividly drawn as a fusion of biology and salvage, with interiority that effectively mirrors her physical state. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("cognitive precision," "desperation") and poetic abstraction rather than purely embodied reaction. The "realization" beat feels slightly intellectualized, mediated by the narrator's interpretation rather than the character's raw experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Structure is solid, moving cleanly from the prompt (midnight calls) to execution (building) to resonance (activation). The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the station's purpose from external signal to internal solace. The pacing is controlled, though the inciting instructions function more as backstory setup than active, in-scene pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and tactile, integrating decay ("verdigris," "rusted deck") seamlessly with the narrative arc. The station and the censer foot are not just backdrops but active constraints that charge the final image, fulfilling the high-band requirement for environment shaping the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as internal survival and memory, but the external pressure is static (rising waters are background). The conflict drives a meaningful change in purpose (outward to inward signal), but the lack of active opposition or sharp, on-page obstacles limits the sense of escalating risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme is potent but undercut by "Thematic Echo" and over-articulation. The narrative explicitly explains its metaphors ("The geography of loss wasn't terrain you crossed; it was terrain you constructed") and the core concept ("understanding that reverse migration meant..."), rather than trusting the final image to convey this meaning implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the surreal, melancholic tone. The prose rhythm mimics the mechanical/tidal themes effectively ("shrieked with static," "click like a bone"). The perspective remains tightly anchored in the navigator’s worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("bell a wound opening," "click like a bone"). There are minor instances of overwriting where metaphors become stacked or slightly purple ("neurological tide tied to," "swallowed all frequencies"), but the craft is generally polished and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cyborg lighthouse keeper with the concept of "reverse migration" is fresh and imaginative. The story transforms standard post-apocalyptic tropes into a specific, intimate study of grief, avoiding generic survival clichés.</comment>
