<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation is clear, and the connection between her art and grief is well-drawn. However, the attribute "quietly driven" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through friction; her epiphany relies heavily on the sexton explaining the theme to her, rather than an active discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary and montage ("Winter arrived early," "returned daily") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. The resolution pivots on a secondary character explaining the central mystery, rendering the protagonist somewhat passive in the story's turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visual descriptions are vivid and precise, with strong use of color ("burnt sienna," "honeyed light"). The "amber pavilion" and the specific mechanics of the cathedral glass (laminated sheets) ground the story effectively in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The conflict is internal and low-stakes; the "cost" is merely repainting a mural, which feels low-risk. The tension is diffused by the montage structure, and the resolution comes from external information rather than a forced trade-off or difficult choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily over-articulated. The ending explicitly states the moral ("act of radical hope... declaration that light would return") instead of allowing it to resonate through subtext. The sexton's dialogue also functions as a direct thematic explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric. However, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "dawning hush," "umbral tenderness") twice each feels mechanical and disrupts the natural cadence of the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the flow is generally smooth, the prose suffers from repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("umbral tenderness" and "dawning hush" both appear twice as noun phrases). There is also significant filtering ("She began to reckon," "She understood at last") that summarizes internal states instead of showing them.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a grieving artist finding hope through a wise mentor is a familiar trope. While the specific detail of the glass layers is inventive, the overall trajectory and the moralizing conclusion feel standard.</comment>
