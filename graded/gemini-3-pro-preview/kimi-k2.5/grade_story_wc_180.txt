<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clearly dramatized through the shift from professional obligation to personal reconciliation. Her quartz prosthetic eyes are not just cosmetic but shape her perception of the work ("stress fractures"), grounding the fantasy element in character reality. The internal monologue regarding "deciduous vows" feels slightly expository, telling the reader her emotional conclusion rather than letting it emerge solely from the action. However, the decision to abandon the professional kit for the grandmother’s tools is a strong, character-defining choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative arc that resolves into a strong Conceptual Repricing: "mending" is redefined from restoration to stabilization. The closure is excellent, anchored by the physical ritual of leaving the ribbon and knife, which enacts the internal change with visible cost (letting go of the relic). The causality is tight, with the initial discovery of the ribbon organically driving the shift in tactic and philosophy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific interplay of "limestone corbels" and "water sprouts" constrains the protagonist's tactical choices. Sensory details are vivid and precise, moving beyond visual description to include texture (sap, stone dust) and sound (clicking lenses). The environment acts as an antagonist and eventual partner, justifying the high score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal but is effectively externalized through the physical labor of pruning and stabilizing the ruin. The discovery of the ribbon provides a sharp meaningful deepening of the stakes, transforming a job into a personal reckoning. While the "breach of contract" backstory provides good context, the resolution relies heavily on a philosophical shift that feels slightly lower-pressure than the physical setup implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but suffers from explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("learned that some sacred things are saved not by being fixed..."). The "deciduous vows" concept, while poetic, is explained in a didactic summary ("She explained that...") rather than emerging purely through subtext. This over-articulation at the climax robs the imagery of its resonant potential, triggering the penalty for sermonizing endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending the technical language of mending with the organic imagery of the orchard. The distinct perceptual signature of the quartz eyes is well-maintained ("casting rainbows across the nave"). The transition from grumpy practicality ("muttering curses") to reflective wisdom is managed smoothly without breaking the established POV distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong specific nouns ("corbels," "resin," "rust"). However, some phrasing leans towards the precious ("green prayers," "deciduous vows" repeated three times), and the prompt-inserted phrase "endearingly feisty" stands out as a clunky adverb-adjective cluster. The line-level craft is otherwise dense and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of solarpunk elements (quartz prosthetics, cathedral-orchard) with a grounded story of generational healing feels fresh and specific. The resolution—choosing to stabilize a ruin as a garden rather than restore it—subverts the typical "fix-it" trope effectively. It avoids generic fantasy templates by focusing on the specific labor of the trade.</comment>
