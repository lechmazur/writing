<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eleanor is distinct and competent, and her trait of being "devotedly observant" drives the investigation effectively. However, her decision to dismantle her empire lacks internal friction; she accepts the destruction of her fortune with "grace" and laughter, making the cost feel conceptually acknowledged but emotionally underweight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, moving cleanly from the allegation to the mathematical verification and the final decision. The use of "proof by contradiction" as a plot device provides a satisfying, logical pivot point, and the closure (Decisive Change) is unambiguous and impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific tools (star charts) and the vertical geography (clouds, moon) are required to solve the puzzle. Sensory details like the "ink harvested from squid" and the "echoing observatory" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that grounds the fantasy elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>External stakes are high—the collapse of a commercial empire—and the escalation from calculation to publication is coherent. The score is limited only because the protagonist's immediate, unhesitating willingness to pay the price dampens the dramatic tension of the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The metaphor of orbits integrates well with the narrative, transforming a physical trajectory into a moral one naturally. While the phrase "orbits of regret" is explicit, the final image of being a "body in free fall" resonates strongly with the theme of liberating truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished, matching Eleanor's "solemn playfulness" with elevated diction. The tone successfully balances scientific precision with lyrical reflection, maintaining a cohesive distance appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and propulsive, though occasionally bordering on purple (e.g., "sound like silver coins dropping into velvet"). The repetition of "solemn playfulness" serves as an effective frame, and the line-level description of the calculation keeps the pacing tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of newsprint industry stakes with a high-altitude steampunk aesthetic is fresh. Using a specific mathematical concept (proof by contradiction) to resolve the central moral dilemma adds distinct ingenuity to the narrative arc.</comment>
