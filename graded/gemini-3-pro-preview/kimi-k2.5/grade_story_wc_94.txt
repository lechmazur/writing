<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to break silence is clear, but the protagonist's internal state is described through poetic labels ("furiously tranquil") rather than dramatized psychological struggle. Her resolve is absolute from the start, leaving little room for conflicting impulses or doubt to drive the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The vigil structure frames the narrative effectively, and the discovery provides a clear pivot point. However, the conceptual repricing—linking the bus timetable to a "map of waiting"—relies heavily on metaphorical convenience rather than strict causal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting is atmospheric and mirrors the internal storm effectively. Specific props like the darkroom timer and timetable anchor the abstract themes, though descriptions occasionally drift into overwrought imagery ("cumulus ocean").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conflict is largely intellectual and retrospective; the external threat of the censors is distant, leaving the on-page tension low. The struggle is resolved through epiphany and endurance rather than active confrontation or immediate risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of censorship and memory are coherent but delivered via explicit statements ("scars are not damage but geography") in the finale. This lack of subtext and the overt moralizing flatten the narrative resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the poet protagonist, but lacks dynamic range. The high register creates a distancing effect, filtering even visceral moments through heavy "writerly" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose suffers from significant lexical repetition ("rarefied" x3, "storm-kissed" x2, "furiously tranquil" x2) and a high density of "Abstract Noun of Abstract Noun" metaphors ("cartography of scars," "architecture of survival"). This density obscures immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blend of observatory and darkroom imagery provides a fresh aesthetic to the resistance narrative. However, the core arc—leaving a manuscript for the next rebel—is a familiar genre convention that plays out predictably.</comment>
