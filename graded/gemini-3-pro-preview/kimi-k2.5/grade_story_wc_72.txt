<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Corvin is a compelling, distinct focalizer whose internal state matches his physical nature ("calcified fingers," "granite heart"). His struggle is internalized but lucid, though the epiphany regarding his motivation feels slightly lectured rather than earned through a harder on-page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from static pressure to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the garden "breathing" and "spiraling"). The resolution is conceptually satisfying, though the linear execution—Corvin plans, understands, and acts without unexpected external friction—feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exemplary integration of setting; the "structural weakness" and "hydrothermal current" are not just backdrop but active constraints that dictate the method of resolution. The atmosphere is tangible, effectively blending the toxic and the beautiful ("violet bruises," "iron and old light").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The internal stakes are high, but the external pressure is static; Corvin faces no active opposition from the environment, only the passive weight of history. The escalation is philosophical rather than dramatic, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "nuance in certainty" is integral and resonant, landing well in the final image. However, the narrative tends to explicitly articulate the thesis in Corvin's thoughts ("He understood now that his motivation was...") rather than trusting the subtext to carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately poetic for the subject matter. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining a tight focus on Corvin's perception of the shift from silence to song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is rich and evocative, but the specific phrase "incisively kind" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a distracting template cadence. Additionally, some metaphor clusters ("bioluminescent plankton awakened in chains of logic") feel slightly overwrought and mixed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of elements; the concept of a "living statue" acting as a "midwife" for nuance in a drowned city is fresh and striking. The execution avoids standard tropes, offering a unique perspective on healing and judgment.</comment>
