<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya functions primarily as a thematic mouthpiece; attributes like "warmly observant" are applied as labels rather than demonstrated through costly action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively as Charged Poise through the physical transfer of the cicada, creating a legible reconfiguration of the relationship despite the soft pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The grotto setting is rendered with vivid sensory detail ("scattered salt"), though the "tidal-pool" professional identity feels convenient rather than organic to the cave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent and the resolution—trading an immediate answer for a symbolic promise—validly reweights the stakes, though the conflict remains low-heat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Subtext is collapsed by explicit thematic statements ("we were inhabiting a transition period ourselves," "most honest transition"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dialogue lacks naturalism, reading as essayistic exposition ("time has texture") that explains the metaphor rather than advancing character goals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally purple; dense similes ("mirrors into windows") stall momentum and signal "literary" intent rather than emotional truth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>A competent execution of a standard literary epiphany template; the elements (symbolic object, nature metaphor) are arranged conventionally without fresh subversion.</comment>
