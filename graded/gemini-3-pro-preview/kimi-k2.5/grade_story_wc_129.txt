<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is declared via summary ("desperate to graft oneself") rather than dramatized through resistance or specific interaction. The attribute "boldly sympathetic" appears as a direct label ("Kael, boldly sympathetic by nature") rather than emerging from a difficult choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story violates the scope default by relying on broad summary ("For seventeen cycles," "Each night") instead of a continuous scene or shards. The narrative arc reads like a synopsis of a longer work, lacking the immediate causal traction of a specific scene window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid but relies on abstract synesthesia ("tasted of copper and old songs") that creates distance. While the "crystalline orchard" is distinct, the descriptions often feel decorative rather than constraining Kael's tactile choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Conflict is resolved through montage ("The search became their language") rather than a distinct moment of high-stakes confrontation. The resolution—finding the artist and building the bridge—feels inevitable and lacks a felt on-page cost or moment of doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The ending explicitly states the theme ("art was not meant to outlast the artist..."), flattening subtext into a moral lesson. This sermonizing closure resolves the narrative intellectually but robs the final image of resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like register, but this elevation creates a barrier to intimacy. The shift to "travelers would speak" at the end further distances the POV from the immediate emotional experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with adjectival padding ("frozen starlight," "spectral rainbows") that slows momentum. The phrase "luminescent ache" is inserted awkwardly, contributing to a "purple" aesthetic that obscures rather than reveals.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of street art culture (tagging) with a high-fantasy crystalline crater is a fresh concept. However, the execution as a distant summary/fable limits the potential impact of this original pairing.</comment>
