<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s primary trait ("logically emotional") is established via direct exposition ("She was logically emotional by nature") rather than dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. The internal struggle between her mathematical training and emotional intuition is summarized as a completed understanding rather than played out as a volatile, active tension during the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The resolution relies on a convenient backstory patch (a hidden slot discovered six months ago) rather than an earned tactical shift or resourcefulness in the moment. The closure is a "net win" with only physiological aftermath ("shaking") as the cost; the protagonist had the solution all along, diminishing the narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is rendered with vivid sensory details ("biting wind," "hues of amber and rose") that effectively ground the physical action. However, the interior of the lighthouse feels somewhat generic ("spiral stairs," "lantern room") compared to the specific texture of the exterior environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The conflict is external and linear, with generic shadow entities providing physical pressure that is resolved instantly by the mechanic of the key. The climax lacks a genuine trade-off or deepening of stakes; the protagonist succeeds by activating a pre-existing mechanism rather than making a difficult sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("saved by the marriage of engineering and soul") rather than emerging organically from the narrative action. This overt moralizing flattens the potential resonance of the "sonic absolution" concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice relies heavily on "telling" ("Mara knew," "Mara understood," "required something beyond mathematics"), creating distance from the immediate experience. The insertion of prompt-specific phrasing results in clunky constructions ("fleshly ethereal nature of the moment") that disrupt the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is frequently overwrought, relying on adjective stacking ("fleeting golden sunset," "complex patterns") and abstract technical jargon ("vibrational signature," "logarithmic calculation") that slows momentum. The "fleshly ethereal" phrase reads as a forced insertion rather than a natural description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the aesthetic combination of lighthouse engineering and spectral defense is visually distinct, the "singing to defeat evil" resolution is a familiar trope. The execution relies on convenient mechanics ("hidden slot") rather than a fresh or surprising synthesis of the elements.</comment>
