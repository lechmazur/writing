<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s obsession is grounded effectively in the loss of her daughter, giving emotional weight to the abstract phenomenon of unbinding. Her interiority is specific and contradictory—she archives what she cannot save—and the final refusal to share her experience earns the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis; Lira’s decision to remain "bound" and withhold the light is a decisive conceptual repricing of the premise. The narrative drive is coherent, moving from observation to confirmation to a final ethical stance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional, with the high-altitude flora and "merciless" light directly pressuring the mood and theme. The library itself feels like an active participant, "reading its own collection," which heightens the sense of autonomous detachment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate from academic curiosity to a personal defense of the self. The unbinding of the library shadow provides immediate, situational pressure that forces the protagonist's final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The metaphor of shadow as "hope" or "ambition" is handled with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed allegory. The theme of privacy versus collective dilution resolves poignantly in the final image of the unshared light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is precise, melancholic, and highly controlled, matching Lira’s "sharp-eyed" persona. The distance is well-managed, keeping the focus tight on her perception without leaking into the collective mindset she opposes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory anchoring (the stone, the light). The phrase "luminous regret," while thematically apt, leans slightly into poetic abstraction ("filled the space between her ribs") where a more grounded somatic detail might have hit harder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stratospheric, overgrown library with a critique of digital shared consciousness is fresh and compelling. The concept of "unbinding" shadows offers a unique, visual vocabulary for the loss of ego and privacy.</comment>
