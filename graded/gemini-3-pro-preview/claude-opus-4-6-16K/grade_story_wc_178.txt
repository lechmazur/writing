<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Miriam’s motivation is rigorously defined; her frugality is not just a habit but a philosophical stance that earns the ending's "sufficiency." The transition from scientific skepticism to mystic recognition is handled with interior precision, though the "trembling hands" reaction feels slightly generic for a seasoned professional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean, linear discovery beat that executes a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The pacing is controlled, moving from observation to decryption to realization without wasted motion, though the puzzle’s solution (the tile fitting perfectly) relies slightly on convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting acts as the antagonist and the revelation; the "reimagined" palace walls constrain the action and physically enable the cipher. The specific interplay of "old bronze" light and the schematics charges the final image, meeting the high-band criteria for active setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conflict is internalized and intellectual—meaning vs. indifference—which fits the length but lacks visceral external pressure. The escalation is quiet, relying on the wonder of discovery rather than an active threat, which limits the tension intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypted devotion" is seamlessly integrated, and the ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the premise. The final line ("She found this sufficient") perfectly synthesizes the character's worldview with the story's cosmic scale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice balances scientific precision with lyrical reverence ("void returned nothing"), suiting the protagonist perfectly. There is a slight distance in moments of realization ("She suspected that..."), but the tone remains coherent and authoritative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("stars as writing left by gods"). However, stock phrasing like "a chill that had nothing to do with the desert evening" and the scaffolding of "She was, by all accounts..." prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeology, astronomy, and theology into "encrypted devotion" is highly original. The concept of the void's silence being a valid part of the covenant transforms a standard trope into a fresh insight.</comment>
