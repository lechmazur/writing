<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and embodied, grounding the trauma in physical sensation ("muscles rigid," "breath stopped") rather than abstract labels. The shift from freezing to finding the "pearl" is earned through established practice, and the lingering cost (shaking hands, crooked lavender) authenticates the character's partial but real victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure effectively uses the therapist’s framework as a setup for the climactic test (the pneumatic drill). Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist doesn't erase the trauma but integrates it, finding a sustainable stance ("anchor optimism in realism") with visible on-page proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are precise and character-filtered, blending the immediate environment (salt wind, thyme) with the intrusive sensory memories of the event (burning hair). The setting actively supports the isolation necessary for the protagonist's work and charges the final image of the copper light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (psychological stability) is tested by a sharp, situational escalation (the drill) that forces a stance. The resolution emphasizes agency—finding the breath—while the immediate physical cost (tremors) ensures the victory feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of integrating trauma ("holding both the wound and the world") is delivered through concrete action rather than abstraction. The "pearl" metaphor lands as a physical reality, creating earned resonance without slipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and lyrical, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that effectively zooms in during the panic attack. The narrative confidence in describing the somatic experience creates a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional: dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("flattening into a single bright pane of terror"). There are no artifacts or loops; the sentence-level craft drives the emotional momentum with high precision and the imagery remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While the garden-as-healing trope is familiar, the specific somatic focus and the "pearl" imagery give it a distinct texture. The execution elevates the premise to a high literary standard, transforming a standard recovery arc into something specific and tactile.</comment>
