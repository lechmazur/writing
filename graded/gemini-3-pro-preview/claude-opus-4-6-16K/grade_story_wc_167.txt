<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s internal landscape is richly detailed, blending professional expertise with emotional vulnerability. The decision to renounce control ("not to stay") is earned through her reflection on the glass/ripple metaphors, creating a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The characterization is consistent and deep, though the occupational determinism (viewing all of life through glasswork) feels slightly heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is tight and effective, using the "noctilucent" hour to frame a moment of decision before the daughter's arrival. The closure unit—a shift in stance from fixing to listening—is legible and carries emotional cost. However, the final paragraph over-explains the metaphor, weakening the resonance of the closure image by turning it into a stated moral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting of Pearl Bay and the prism atrium is integral, driving both the atmosphere and the central metaphor of refraction and stress. The sensory details of light and water are vivid and specific. While eligible for higher bands due to the environment charging the final image, the global gate (Q2 &lt; 9.0) caps this score at 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The internal stakes are clear, and the pressure of the looming ferry arrival provides sufficient situational drive. The deepening—from analyzing the physics of ripples to accepting the lack of control over her daughter—works well under the Accumulative lens. The conflict remains largely internal and prospective, which limits the visceral "heat" of the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of "hidden architecture" and consequences is coherent but suffers from explicit over-articulation. The narrator states the thesis mid-story ("A window was never just a window...") and delivers a tidy moral at the end ("proof that even the smallest gesture..."), which flattens the subtext and violates the "resist tidy morals" standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, meditative, and appropriately colored by the protagonist's profession. The transition between observation and memory is smooth. The voice control is high, though it occasionally drifts into slightly elevated, didactic registers when explaining the symbolism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("cathedral of refraction"). There is a slight tendency toward scaffolded rhetoric (the "A window was never... A ripple was never..." list) and the repetition of "noctilucent" is noticeable, but the line-level craft is otherwise immediate and publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the glazier's trade with the maternal letting-go is distinct and well-executed. While the central metaphor of "ripples as consequences" is somewhat familiar, the specific context of the atrium and the "noctilucent" light adds a fresh textural layer.</comment>
