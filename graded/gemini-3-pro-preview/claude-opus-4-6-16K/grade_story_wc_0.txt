<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lena’s internal arc is meticulously charted from emotional sterility to earned vulnerability. The backstory regarding the eulogy provides a sharp, character-specific anchor for her flaw ("preprocessing reality") that pays off beautifully in the phone call.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive action (the apology) and a resonant final image (the cosmic web photo) that reconfigures the central metaphor. The narrative earns the shift, though the "grant deadline" subplot feels slightly rote compared to the greenhouse thread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse is an exceptional micro-setting; the sensory details of the "brown tideline" and "iridescent powder" actively drive the protagonist's realization. The environment functions as an antagonist to Lena's initial detachment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The internal conflict is palpable and escalates naturally through the observation of the dust. External pressure is low—the grant deadline is a minor irritant rather than a true stake—but the emotional stakes with the mother carry the weight effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central parallel between neutron star decay and butterfly dust is poignant and well-integrated. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("humility... was not dramatic; it was... gradual"), flattening the ambiguity of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice consistently filters the world through Lena's scientific lexicon ("confounding variable," "filamentary structure") without becoming cold. The shift to emotional openness preserves this distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory imagery is vivid and precise ("ribcage after a blow"). However, the prose occasionally stumbles into definition-heavy exposition ("Decay: the slow, inexorable weakening...") that tells rather than shows the concept.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a scientist finding humanity through a professional metaphor is a familiar trope. The specific synthesis of neutron stars and butterfly wing dust creates a fresh texture, but the emotional trajectory remains traditional.</comment>
