<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s transition from fleeing observation to bearing witness is deeply earned via the ghost encounter. The "astonished recluse" trait creates excellent friction with the ghosts' need for attention, driving the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flawless structural arc; the ghost encounter serves as a decisive pivot for the protagonist's trajectory. Closure is definitive (deciding to stay) and resonates powerfully with the established "covenant."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Specific details ("white crusts," "amber and violet") ground the supernatural elements. The setting actively pressures the protagonist—the scorched wasteland makes the oasis a necessary refuge—and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The internal stakes (isolation vs. connection) are tightly braided with the supernatural pressure. The cost of the resolution—accepting the psychological "weight" of the covenant—is palpable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing is poignant, but the explicit summary of the lesson ("she understood finally... not to escape... but to learn") near the end replaces subtext with moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly controlled, perfectly matching Maren's perceptive isolation ("shape of conversation"). The narrative distance remains stable and intimate throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of the phrase "contextual clues" feels mechanical. Occasional phrasings ("forgotten mercy," "bone-dry," "mute eloquence") lean into cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes and magical realism; the specific combination of the bee covenant and the tethered ghosts feels unique and inevitable.</comment>
