<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voss is a compelling focalizer whose sensory-specific worldview grounds the emotional arc. The shift from passive grief to active purpose is earned through the revelation, though the internal monologue regarding the "weight of truth" feels slightly over-articulated rather than purely embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and leads to a legible Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the middle section relies on a dense block of expository summary to explain the shard's mechanics, which stalls momentum slightly before the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "sensory map maker" concept creates a unique, tactile interface with the setting (nerve grafts reading ghost signals). The environment is not just a backdrop but the primary tool for the protagonist's investigation, enriching the scene significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, but the climax relies on the protagonist passively witnessing a vision rather than making a difficult choice under immediate pressure. The resolution is satisfying emotionally, but the lack of active struggle in the peak moment limits the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The thematic pivot from senseless accident to deliberate sacrifice lands with genuine resonance. The final image of the "ballast" effectively recontextualizes the grief without becoming overly sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical precision with lyrical introspection ("skin of the universe"). The narrative distance zooms in effectively during the vision, maintaining the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. Descriptions like "recycled condensation falling from severed coolant lines" establish tone immediately without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "nerve graft sensory mapper" is a fresh, specific angle on the investigator archetype that elevates the material. The underlying plot of a parent's secret sacrifice is a familiar trope, but it is executed with specific, grounded detail.</comment>
