<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist functions effectively as a fable archetype, with actions cleanly aligned to her motivation. However, the lack of contradictory impulses or deeper psychological cost limits the characterization; she operates more as a symbolic agent of change than a fully realized individual under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear accumulative/situational drive, where the setup of the "shutter constellation" pays off causally when the boy arrives. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration of the boy's state, earned by the protagonist's specific, established method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is deeply integrated; the warehouse and dock are not merely backdrop but the physical tools used to resolve the scene. Sensory details like "cobalt dock" and "smelled of iron" are vivid, specific, and atmospherically consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conflict is quiet but coherent; the boy's arrival provides a necessary test for the guardian's preparation. While the stakes are low-key and atmospheric, the shift in the boy's demeanor offers a legible release of tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on explicit thematic assertions ("loneliness is a shutter," "teach darkness the value of stars") rather than trusting the imagery to carry the meaning. This over-articulation flattens subtext and reduces the interpretive resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the fable-like tone. The shift in focus from the mechanical arrangement of shutters to the boy's emotional state is handled with controlled narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery is high-density and evocative ("mirror-skin," "coin of light"), maintaining strong momentum. The phrase "spiralingly calm" is a clunky adverbial construction that feels unnatural, but the surrounding prose is precise and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central conceit—using a dental mirror to reflect warehouse shutters as a constellation—is highly original and visually specific. It successfully transforms a mundane setting into something magical without relying on supernatural tropes.</comment>
