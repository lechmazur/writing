<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's internal landscape of "watercolor" numbness is vividly rendered, creating immediate empathy and clear motivation. The "complementary opposites" dynamic provides a distinct, structural basis for the relationship between the original and the clone, avoiding cliché doppelgänger tropes. The emotional arc from dissociation to "undeniably real" integration is earned through the specific mechanism of the sparring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, with a clear inciting incident (the reveal) and a resonant resolution (the integration). The "hours" of sparring are summarized rather than fully dramatized, which compresses the pivotal turning point, but the structural logic of the "dojo" holds firmly. Closure is achieved with a tangible cost—the burial of the template and the acceptance of a dual existence—satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active metaphor for the protagonist's internal state ("earth's crust forgot itself and reformed"). The surreal imagery of "tectonic memories" and "dinosaur bones surfacing" grounds the metaphysical conflict in concrete, atmospheric detail. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of burying the brain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stakes are existential and immediately legible: custody of a life. The escalation through physical combat that morphs into emotional exchange is coherent under the causal lens. The resolution is not a victory of one over the other but a synthesis, which feels like a fresh and earned deepening of the initial conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of reintegrating a fractured self is handled with sophistication, using the sci-fi premise to externalize a psychological process. While Shen's explanation of "complementary opposites" is slightly didactic, the thematic resonance of the ending—finding reality in the space between happiness and sorrow—is profound and avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and precise, perfectly matching the surreal tone. However, the dialogue carries a heavy burden of exposition ("This is Kael-2... Cloned from your neural tissue... She filed the claim"), which feels slightly more functional than natural compared to the high quality of the narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Phrases like "surgeons extracted a tumor nestled against her temporal lobe" and "geometry of the situation" demonstrate high precision. The writing balances the abstract (ego death) with the visceral (wind, rope, sweat) without slipping into purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a martial arts duel, a custody battle, and a surreal geological phenomenon creates a unique narrative space. The metaphorical treatment of "ego death" as a literal cloning dispute offers a fresh angle on identity stories, elevating the premise beyond standard tropes.</comment>
