<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is a highly competent protagonist whose agency drives the resolution. The shift from "unremarkable graduate student" to a pariah willing to bear "human hatred" is a compelling arc that lands with genuine emotional weight. The lack of on-page internal struggle or temptation regarding the "gifts" prevents a higher score, as her decision feels slightly inevitable rather than agonizingly chosen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure is incredibly efficient, using summary to establish high stakes before pivoting to a decisive, dramatized climax. The closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "loss" of the gifts is reframed as a victory with a heavy social cost. Causality is tight, and the "analog board" constraint pays off perfectly in the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is established with sensory precision—"burnt coffee," "ionized dust," and vibrations felt in the chest ground the sci-fi elements in physical reality. The specific limitation of the "ancient analog board" is well-integrated as a plot enabler. While effective, the descriptions lean slightly on standard "gritty tech room" tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are masterful; the trade-off between immediate utopian gifts and long-term survival creates immense pressure. The escalation from "clean energy" to "poison" is logical and terrifying, forcing a high-cost intervention. The protagonist’s choice to sabotage the "miracle" creates a lasting, meaningful consequence that reweights her standing in the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of skepticism and the burden of truth is handled with sophistication, avoiding preachy morals. The final insight—that "hatred was a human problem" she could live with compared to the alien threat—offers a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the conflict. The "Cassandra" archetype is refreshed by the protagonist's acceptance of her role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending scientific competence with an undercurrent of dread. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, staying close to Maren’s perception while effectively summarizing the broader campus chaos. The tone shifts appropriately from wonder to suspicion to grit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery like "unraveling like wet paper" and "searchlight finding a fugitive." The rhythm propels the story forward without drag. A few phrases like "blood go cold" are slightly clichéd, preventing a top-tier score, but the overall execution is sharp and publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While the "Trojan Horse" alien signal is a known trope, the specific execution via subsonic frequencies and the "mirror" resolution is clever and distinct. The ending, which positions the protagonist as a hated savior rather than a celebrated hero, adds a layer of complexity that elevates the premise above standard fare.</comment>
