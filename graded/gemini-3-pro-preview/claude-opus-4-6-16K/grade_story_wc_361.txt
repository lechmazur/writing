<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific physical trait (the courier's tremor) is brilliantly repurposed as the catalyst for the magical mechanism, effectively integrating character flaw and plot resolution. The internal shift from professional anxiety to stillness is dramatized through action rather than summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a powerful Decisive Change and Earned Stasis; the cost (professional reputation/fee) is explicitly acknowledged ("Let the fee evaporate"). The pacing perfectly supports the transition from movement to stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the aurora interacts physically with the object (filaments catching the light), and the "thin mountain soil" provides the necessary grounding for the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conflict between the "jittery" professional obligation and the desire to stop is resolved through a clear choice with legible cost. The external pressure (client, warden) is felt, though slightly less immediate than the internal drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of valuing wonder over commodity is well-executed through the seed metaphor. The mentor’s imagined dialogue ("world rewards the ones who stop") is slightly on-the-nose but fits the memory-to-myth frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice possesses a distinct rhythm that mirrors the character's state—anxious and quick initially, slowing to a resonant calm at the close. The perceptual signature is sharp and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without being purple; images like "caught light the way a creek catches leaves" are fresh and precise. No scaffold or drag; the rhythm propels the reader forward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the "magic seed" and "courier" tropes are familiar, the synthesis—specifically the sympathetic vibration of the tremor waking the relic—feels fresh and specific to this character.</comment>
