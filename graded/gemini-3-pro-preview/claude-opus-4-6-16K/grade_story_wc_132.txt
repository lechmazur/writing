<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, well-realized protagonist; the trait "circuitously sincere" adds excellent specificity to her interactions and worldview. Her internal pivot is grounded in character, though the reliance on expository summary to describe her emotional shift ("She did not want to become someone new") slightly distances the reader from the immediate struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story establishes a strong inciting incident and setting but dissolves into summary to handle the resolution ("So Maren started to reconstruct... Customers returned"). This reliance on montage rather than a dramatized scene for the "reconstruction" phase dilutes the narrative tension and prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting details are vivid and thematic, particularly the "mossy trellis" and the "fractal paths" of the linden leaf. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state. (Score capped at 8.8 due to Q2 &lt; 9.0 per global gate).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the internal conflict is clear, the external resolution is too convenient; customers return "drawn by something they could not name" without Maren facing a concrete test or cost for her new, wilder methods. The lack of a dramatized obstacle in the second half lowers the stakes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of relinquishing control to find resilience is coherent and beautifully integrated with the garden imagery. The final image of standing in the rain resonates well with the core concept. (Score capped at 8.8 due to Q2 &lt; 9.0 per global gate).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and authoritative, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. However, it leans heavily on expository interiority ("Maren had always believed...") to convey information that could have been subtextual or shown through action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is distinct and high-density ("number that felt like a wound," "stitching decay into structure"). Line-level craft is strong, with good rhythm and evocative imagery, though the summary sections lose some propulsion. (Score capped at 8.8 due to Q2 &lt; 9.0 per global gate).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a control-freak gardener learning to embrace wildness is a familiar trope. While the execution is elegant, the plot follows a predictable trajectory without a surprising twist or recontextualization to distinguish it from the standard genre template.</comment>
