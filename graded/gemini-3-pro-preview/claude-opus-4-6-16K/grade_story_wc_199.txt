<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lirren’s transition from rigid categorizer to intuitive builder is dramatized effectively through specific actions (sorting vs. monument building). The internal shift is marked by the distinct "moss-green delight" beat, grounding the transformation in embodied emotion rather than just summary. The cost—sacrificing her most precious folklore page and the moonstone—demonstrates a clear reordering of values. The trait of "always emerging transformed" feels slightly expository at the end, but the on-page behavior earns the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Causal arc where the protagonist’s active decoding and building directly drive the resolution. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: she creates a new role for herself (translator/bridge) with a legible cost paid in the loss of her safety objects (the page and stone). The orientation is immediate, and the causal chain from falling leaves to the arbor’s reaction is unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "ashen skyborne arbor" is vivid and integral, not just a backdrop; the "sky the color of spent hearths" sets a distinct atmosphere. The setting actively participates in the climax (the arbor shuddering, leaves erupting), fulfilling the high-band requirement for environment charging the final image. Details like the petrified wood and bone stylus anchor the fantasy in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively raised from a disruption of daily order to a moment of prophecy that demands a permanent change in the protagonist. The pressure builds coherently through the leaf symbols, forcing Lirren to abandon her established sorting system. The cost is tangible—the moonstone and the folklore page—and the choice to use them is a clear moment of agency that irreversibly alters her path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving memory through transformation is resonant and well-threaded through the seed/monument motif. The line "Build for what is forgotten" borders on a slightly didactic thesis statement, but it drives immediate action rather than just moralizing. The ending successfully elevates the concept, moving from personal task to communal function without losing the intimate focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the fable-like quality of the story ("hush where past meets prophecy"). Interiority is filtered strictly through Lirren’s orderly but receptive worldview. The shift in rhythm during the monument building mirrors her internal state, demonstrating strong control over narrative distance and texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory imagery ("spores went into the envelope," "point of frozen light"). The mandatory phrases ("moonstone cabochon dust speck," "mossy delight") are integrated smoothly, though "ancient and damp and alive" is a slight adjective stack. Sentence variety supports the pacing well, accelerating appropriately during the arbor's shuddering climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a skyborne arbor and seed sorting provides a fresh container for the prophecy trope. The synthesis of the "Moth Queen" folklore with the physical act of building miniature monuments creates a unique specific action. The transformation of a sorter into an architect of grief/memory feels distinct and earned.</comment>
