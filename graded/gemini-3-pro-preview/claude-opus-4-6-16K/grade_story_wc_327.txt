<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren is strongly embodied through the copper veins, which ground her magical role in physical cost ("remnants of a ritual... humming faintly"). Her motivation to preserve the "texture" of the world is clear and drives the narrative focus, though her solitary position limits the exploration of relational dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central epiphany relies on a fortuitous external signal—the birds forming the "resonance" glyph exactly when needed—which weakens the causal chain of the resolution. While the closure itself (the diamond clearing, the echoes remembering) is resonant, the pivot leading to it feels convenient rather than fully earned by internal agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the acoustic properties of the canyon and the bone towers are not just scenery but the mechanism for the story's resolution and closure. The sensory details ("calcified remains," "tunnel of echoes") charge the final image with high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are conceptually high (extinction of a language), and the cost is felt in the acceptance that the speakers will die even if the echo remains. However, the immediate on-page pressure is somewhat low; the diamond's threat is historical rather than an active, escalating obstacle in the scene itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "brokenness finding a voice" is woven tightly into the plot mechanics and the nature of the diamond. The realization that the curse is "hunger" rather than malice offers a sophisticated thematic turn that supports the resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic register that supports the high-concept premise ("before the language had a word for forgetting"). The tone is controlled and confident, successfully selling the abstract magic system.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic, effectively translating abstract concepts into sensory experiences. A few phrases lean slightly into pathetic fallacy ("sky refused to give") or abstraction ("something wounded and strange"), but the line-level craft is generally polished and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound, texture, and memory creates a fresh inflection on the "dying language" trope. The specific combination of the copper veins and the acoustic physics of the canyon gives the story a distinct identity.</comment>
