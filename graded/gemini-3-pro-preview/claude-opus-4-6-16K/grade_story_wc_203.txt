<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marco’s professional competence ("analyzing dust") is perfectly welded to his supernatural burden, creating a unique interiority. The choice to break his 23-year rule of non-engagement is earned by the ghost's unprecedented direct gaze, anchoring the shift in immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is seamless: Marco’s specific skill set allows the discovery, which triggers the silence, forcing the interaction. Closure lands with a tangible cost (the locket/quest) and a clear reconfiguration of his routine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but a forensic tool; the description of the ceiling as the "honest part" of the building effectively turns architecture into character psychology. The specific details (fluorescent buzz, warped floors) actively constrain and guide the protagonist's focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a routine repair to a confrontation with the unknown when the ghost breaks established rules. The "sudden silence" functions as a sharp, atmospheric pressure point that forces the protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "structural and emotional settling" resonates powerfully through the physical details of the cracks and the locket. The resolution avoids heavy-handed moralizing, opting for a quiet release of burden that aligns perfectly with the story's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined, observational distance that matches Marco’s character. The shift from technical assessment to supernatural engagement is handled without breaking the established pragmatic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagery-rich without dragging; "the way dust settles when the air finally stops moving" is an exquisite, earned description of the ghost's departure. No scaffold or loops; every sentence advances the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of blue-collar tradecraft (elevator repair, dust analysis) with a ghost story offers a genuinely fresh perspective. The "forensic" approach to the supernatural elevates the premise beyond standard genre tropes.</comment>
