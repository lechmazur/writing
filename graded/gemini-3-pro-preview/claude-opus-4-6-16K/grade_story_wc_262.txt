<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, capable protagonist whose specific "gift" drives the narrative logic and voice. The internal conflict between her professional duty (finding Luce) and her spiritual philosophy (preserving the sanctity of stored emotion) is resolved through a clear, on-page choice to lie to the executor. The "contradictory impulse" is present but subtle; a sharper moment of hesitation or cost to her personally would push this into the 9s.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving from the inciting assignment to the psychometric revelation and a decisive closure. The drive lens acts as a Hybrid, blending situational pressure with causal discovery (the vision reveals Luce looking back), leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the premise—the "unrequited" love is revealed to be acknowledged and is then deliberately preserved. The causality holds firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but the thematic container for the story's core concept; the projection booth "incubating" the emotion is essential. Specific details like the "carbon-arc projectors" and the scent of "acetate and warm dust" ground the metaphysical elements in tangible reality. The environment actively charges the final image, satisfying the high-band requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The deepening of the stake—from finding a person to understanding the nature of the love recorded on the film—is handled well. The "turn" (Luce looking back) effectively recontextualizes the tragedy into something sacred. The external stakes are low (the executor is abstract), but the conceptual stakes are high and resolved with a clear stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of emotional residue and the sanctity of "unused" love is woven expertly through the action, avoiding abstract sermonizing by anchoring it in the film strip and letters. The closure offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest: love isn't lost, just stored. The final image of the projectors holding the silence is poignant and thematically cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Maren's unique perception ("architecture of feeling"). The transition into the vision is smooth, and the tone modulates effectively between the dusty reality of the booth and the "hushed thunder" of the past. The internal monologue supports the fable-like quality without becoming overly abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with high-quality imagery ("celluloid slowly remembering its own flammability," "eight frames dense as scripture"). The rhythm supports the emotional beats, slowing down appropriately for the vision. No significant artifacts or loops; the writing is precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While psychometry and "love stored in objects" are established tropes, the story elevates them through specific execution and a strong, non-standard resolution (choosing secrecy over revelation). The synthesis of the movie palace setting with the psychic mechanic feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
