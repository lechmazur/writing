<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling, sharp-edged protagonist with a distinct worldview shaped by her father's trade. Her motivation to find a "fair trade" is beautifully dramatized and drives the climax effectively. The father-daughter dynamic is tense and credible, though the cap applies due to the Q2 logic wobble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and visible cost, but a logic hiccup in the setup drags the score down. The phrasing "The brother didn't exist" flatly contradicts the later reveal "The diplomat's brother is real" in a way that creates confusion rather than intrigue—if the person was invented, finding him is a coincidence; if the danger was invented, the narration shouldn't claim the brother doesn't exist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The funeral home setting is excellent, serving as both atmospheric backdrop and thematic mirror ("making things look alive"). The sensory details of formaldehyde and lavender ground the scene viscerally. Excellent integration, capped only by the global gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are high and the leverage—prison vs. the impossible con—is absolute and well-calibrated. The escalation is swift but earned by Mara's preparation ("waiting actively"). The conflict resolves through character agency, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "the mathematics of a fair trade" is woven tightly into the narrative and resolves beautifully in the final image. The ink pot serves as a potent, non-obvious symbol of this theme. High resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, precise, and consistent, perfectly suiting the "chess player" persona of the protagonist. Control of distance is masterful, maintaining the tension of the confrontation without slipping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with meaning, though a specific lexical echo ("architecture of consequence" / "architecture of human faith") creates a minor distraction. The "architecture" metaphor is strong but its repetition feels unintentional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of forcing a con artist to fulfill his lie is a fresh and satisfying twist on the genre. The specific synthesis of the funeral home setting, the math motif, and the blackmail creates a unique narrative identity.</comment>
