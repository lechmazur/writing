<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara is drawn with sensory precision and competence, but she lacks the internal contradiction or struggle required for higher bands; her blindness functions more as a superpower than a source of friction, and her emotional state remains static throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear "process" arc that lands a valid Earned Stasis closure; while the causality is sound, the absence of a complicating turn or visible trade-off limits the narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the mist and the specific, tactile mechanics of the water trough effectively grounding the sci-fi elements; the setting actively enables the solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The time pressure of the departing ship provides functional external stakes, but the conflict remains purely technical; Elara's absolute certainty prevents the reader from feeling a genuine risk of failure or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of unseen guidance mirrors Elara’s condition and role effectively; the final image of the ship finding direction resonates well with the mechanic’s stasis without forcing a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lyrical, reverent voice suits the atmospheric content and maintains a consistent texture; narrative distance is controlled, though occasionally filters intervene in the sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, but relies too heavily on telling modifiers ("heartfelt artisan," "magnetic calm") rather than letting action convey character traits; the line-level flow is otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "blind artisan" trope is refreshed by the specific water-refraction mechanic, creating a memorable vignette, though the low-risk narrative structure feels safe rather than ingenuous.</comment>
