<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable’s characterization is precise and drives the plot; her professional trait ("logical page indexer") directly informs the "alternative hypothesis" beat, grounding the climax in competence rather than intuition. The interiority regarding "reclaimed stillness" effectively maps her worldview, and the final choice to sacrifice her career for truth demonstrates agency with a palpably felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly causal, moving from discovery to verification to consequence without wasted motion. Closure is a definitive Decisive Change (recording the entry) that locks in the personal cost (loss of funding/job), satisfying the high-band criteria for earned resolution under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the "oilskin," "mineral deposits," and "tick of settling sediment" act as evidence in the verification process. The blackout is used brilliantly to shift the sensory focus from mechanical hum to the "private breathing" of the library, reinforcing the theme of restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined early (truth vs. grant money) and escalate through the verification process, which systematically removes the protagonist's "out" of assuming a mistake. The cost is professional but visceral, though the external antagonism (the consortium) remains off-stage, keeping the conflict primarily internal/intellectual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "honest origins" parallels the physical setting's return to "reclaimed stillness," creating a resonant alignment between the environment and the plot. The ending avoids moralizing, presenting the recording of the entry as a quiet, inevitable act of restoration rather than a triumphant shout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined, "indexer's eye" precision that perfectly suits the protagonist, controlling psychic distance to show her analytical processing of emotion. The shift from clinical observation to the poetic "dappled resolve" is earned and cohesive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and density is high, with strong sensory imagery ("stillness held her like water holds a stone") that serves the story's tone. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match the slowing of time in the blackout, and there are no visible loop or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "underwater library" is a familiar trope, but the story elevates it by focusing on the rigor of cataloging methodology rather than adventure, offering a fresh intellectual angle. The execution is highly specific, though the core premise of "finding the true history" is a classic archeological beat.</comment>
