<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta is a distinct protagonist with a compelling specific background (logistics), but the story relies too heavily on diagnostic interiority to define her arc. Phrases like "forgotten how to care for one person" and "cure for loneliness" explain her psychology rather than dramatizing it through friction in the moment. The "desperately jocular" trait is stated as a label before being shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure image (the moon rock as a lighthouse) is resonant, effectively reconfiguring the protagonist's stance. However, the pivot from isolation to community happens almost entirely in summary ("Within weeks... By autumn"), which distances the reader from the causal turning point. The structure leans on "telling" the change rather than showing the pivotal scene of acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, with the ivy-eaten station serving as both a vivid physical space and a central metaphor for the protagonist's condition. Details like "walls furred green" and the communal kitchen on Platform Three ground the fable-like tone in specific, tactile reality. The environment actively shapes the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The conflict between efficient detachment and messy reciprocity is well-staged, but the escalation is dampened by the summary pacing of the middle section. The protagonist's surrender to the "web of small reciprocities" feels slightly inevitable rather than hard-won, as the friction of losing her privacy is described rather than felt in a dramatized confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity is poignant, but the story undercuts its own resonance with explicit moralizing in the penultimate paragraph ("The cure for loneliness, she realized, was..."). This diagnostic statement explains the subtext that the final image was perfectly capable of carrying on its own, reducing the interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly fable-like quality that suits the "elusive" character and the magical realism elements. The tone balances the bureaucratic history of the character with the whimsy of the plot effectively. Control is strong, though the "diagnostic" slips in interiority slightly flatten the texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("lighter than it looked, porous," "shoe one size too small"). Line-level craft is generally high, though it occasionally relies on scaffolding sentences ("The letter was the catalyst") that explain plot mechanics instead of letting action drive the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of disaster-relief logistics, an overgrown French railway station, and a moon rock is fresh and memorable. The story creates a unique, specific world that feels original and metaphorically rich, avoiding standard tropes of connection and loneliness through its specific logistical lens.</comment>
