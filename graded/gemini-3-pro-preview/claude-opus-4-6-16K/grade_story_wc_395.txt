<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena functions as a competent vehicle for the plot, but her motivation ("philosophical engine") is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through struggle. The "brightly attentive" trait appears as a label to justify discoveries rather than a complex flaw or virtue that complicates the choice to leak the data.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story violates the short-story scope default by relying on broad summary spanning weeks ("that quarter," "dug deeper") rather than a continuous scene. This "synopsis mode" flattens the dramatic arc, reporting the investigation's progress rather than immersing the reader in the pressure of discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The setting consists mostly of generic server room tropes ("hummed in frequencies," "rack temperatures") without specific, tactile details that constrain the protagonist. The physical space is a passive backdrop for data manipulation rather than an active element in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the global stakes are high (missing persons), the on-page pressure is low because the antagonist (Desmond) is handled in a brief summary and the danger remains abstract. The climax is a simple data transfer without a felt personal cost or immediate physical threat to force the decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of corporate memory versus erasure is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("data never truly disappeared," "ghosts had drawn breath"). The ending relies on a somewhat melodramatic assertion of the theme rather than a nuanced, resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but occasionally slips into purple prose ("last breath caught in glass") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The narrative tends to explain realizations ("She understood now") rather than allowing them to emerge organically from the action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and readable, though it relies on some clichés ("cold cases, every one") and standard thriller phrasing. The heavy use of summary prevents high-density scene construction, but line-level mechanics are generally clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of a low-level archivist discovering a conspiracy within deleted files is a very common trope (reminiscent of *The Circle* or *Severance*). The execution follows a standard trajectory without a unique structural twist or fresh conceptual angle to distinguish it.</comment>
