<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is compelling, grounding the mother’s decline in the specific history of the shards (teacup, figurine) rather than summary. The "incomplete information" philosophy provides a sophisticated, character-specific framework for her grief, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ritual structure is sound, but the closure relies on the rocking chair moving for "hours" to time the final release. This physical impossibility in a grounded story feels like a contrived cinematic device rather than earned causality, undermining the ending's realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gallery is an active participant; its "impossible distance" and perspective lines dictate the physical action of the scattering. The setting perfectly mirrors the thematic "mirage of safety," though the score is capped due to the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes of finality are palpable, with the irreversible act of scattering the ash creating genuine pressure. The conflict between preservation (the mask) and release (the ash) is resolved with earned weight, capped only by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "incomplete information" motif is masterfully woven into the action, bridging the mother's artistic technique with Maren's act of letting go. The theme of the "persistent beautiful lie" resonates deeply, capped only by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, handling the spatial transition to the apartment smoothly. The meditative tone supports the pacing well, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imagery like "graphite snow" and the "mosaic of shattered porcelain" is precise and evocative. However, phrases like "needed that feeling more than breath" and "no language for" lean into melodrama and abstract shorthand, slightly diluting the prose's density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the perspective gallery, the ash medium, and the shard mask is fresh and specific. The concept of "burning art to scatter it" is a striking transformation of grief tropes, capped by the Q2 gate.</comment>
