<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lenora is a distinct, competent lead with clear motivation, but her defining trait ("curiosity as affliction") is stated in exposition rather than dramatized through cost. She functions perfectly as an agent of the plot but faces no internal conflict or genuine risk of failure in this specific encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story is a cohesive vignette with a legible inciting incident and closure that lands effectively on the "incidental heroism" concept. However, the narrative arc is linear and low-friction; the resolution arrives without significant obstacles or doubt, limiting dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric grounding is excellent; specific details like the "mist erasing her feet" and "copper" light creating a vivid, immersive setting. The environment actively supports the tone and the magical realism elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the stakes (saving a vulnerable mind) are clear, the external opposition is minimal; the woman yields almost immediately to Lenora's intervention. The scene lacks a meaningful tightening or "micro turn" where the outcome feels genuinely in question before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of connection and "incidental heroism" is resonant and clearly delivered. However, the dialogue carries the heavy lifting ("This feeling... is not you breaking"), feeling slightly didactic and therapeutic rather than subtextual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the melancholy urban fantasy genre. It maintains a steady distance, though it occasionally relies on "as-you-know" narration to establish the rules of the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery ("breath held too long"). The score is capped by a dense block of exposition in the third paragraph that halts momentum to explain the mechanics of the magic system rather than revealing them through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—"contact tracing" for grief using an analog hearing aid—is a fresh, specific synthesis of bureaucratic and supernatural tropes. The premise elevates the otherwise familiar "helping the ghost" narrative.</comment>
