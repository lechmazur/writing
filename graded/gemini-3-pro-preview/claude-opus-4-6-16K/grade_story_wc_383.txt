<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s internal landscape is vividly rendered, moving convincingly from desperate skepticism to a redefined devotion. The concept of "quarantined" memory provides a specific, embodied framework for her grief, grounding the emotional arc. While the repetition of "tragically radiant" feels slightly diagnostic, her final choice to value the "wreckage" over the original creates a strong, character-specific resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Internal lens, using the passage from twilight to dawn to pressure the protagonist toward a necessary realization. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the goal shifts from recovery to reconstruction with a legible conceptual cost (accepting the "imperfect acoustics" over the real Clara). The structure effectively mirrors the "logarithmic spiral" of the shell, circling inward to the core truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden and the shell act as effective constraints; the "resonance structures" concept ties the physical setting directly to the plot's mechanics. The sensory details ("dark petals," "condemned wing in a cathedral") establish a cohesive, melancholic atmosphere that supports the theme. The dawn light serves as a functional clock that forces the scene’s conclusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internalized: the risk of losing Clara completely versus the pain of retrieving a distorted copy. The escalation is quiet, driven by the vigil through the night, but the pressure holds. The turning point—recognizing the fragments as "incomplete" yet "hers"—is a meaningful tightening that resolves the central tension without unearned miracles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "wreckage as architecture" is powerful and organically developed through the imagery of the shell and the garden. However, the explicit articulation of the thesis ("translate isolation into independence") in the penultimate paragraph is slightly too direct, telling the reader the moral rather than letting the final image carry the full resonant weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a "literary archivist," blending scientific metaphor with emotional longing. However, the repetition of the phrase "tragically radiant" (opening and closing) feels more like a forced refrain than an earned motif, and the "silver halide soul" metaphor leans slightly purple. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Maren’s subjective experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variance. The density of figurative language is high ("velvet garden," "amber," "cathedral"), occasionally bordering on overwriting. The personification in the opening line ("held its breath") is a bit standard, but the "imperfect acoustics of a broken shell" offers a sharper, more original image that anchors the craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "memory quarantine" premise revitalizes the trope of amnesia/grief with a fresh, architectural/biological metaphor. Combining this with the acoustic science of "resonance" creates a distinct conceptual space. The resolution avoids the cliché of magical recovery, opting for a more mature and original synthesis of acceptance and reconstruction.</comment>
