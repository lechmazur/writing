<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's arc from confident seer to humble observer is executed with clear interiority ("honesty hurt like swallowing glass"). While her role in the middle beat is somewhat reactive to Sable's guidance, her vulnerability—admitting blindness—effectively earns the internal shift at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The transition from future-sight to present-sight functions as a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, revaluing the protagonist's "ordinary" life as a gain rather than a loss. The causality is clear, though the resolution relies heavily on the introduction of the pearl by a secondary character.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Crystal Caves are rendered with purposeful sensory density, acting as an antagonist that strips the protagonist's defining trait. Details like the "throat mid-song" and the "accidental harmonies" braid sound and sight to actively pressure the character's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from the inciting loss of ability to the sensory disorientation of the "unseen forces." The stakes are intimate but felt, resolving through a necessary shift in stance rather than external conquest, fitting the scope well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of presence versus prediction is resonant, and the final image successfully reweights the protagonist's worldview. However, the explicit dialogue line "To magnify everyday magic" reads as a thematic echo that states the thesis too directly, slightly reducing subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that supports the heightened reality of the setting. The shift in the protagonist's perception is mirrored by the prose, which moves from broad probabilities to minute, illuminated details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and conceptually dense ("absence of light had its own luminosity"). Imagery consistently serves the central motif of light and sound without falling into decorative abstraction or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inversion of the clairvoyant trope—curing the oracle of the future to grant them the present—is a fresh, specific synthesis. The "cave pearl" serves as an effective, grounded metaphor for this shift in attention.</comment>
