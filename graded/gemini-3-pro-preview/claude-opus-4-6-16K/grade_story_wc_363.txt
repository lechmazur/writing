<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sable is a deeply realized protagonist; her interiority is textured with specific metaphors of weaving and silence that reflect her worldview. The choice to weave with jigsaw pieces is a desperate, character-defining act of agency that earns the emotional weight of the conclusion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong, anchored by the accumulation of the tapestry, though the resolution relies on a chain of coincidences (trader-smuggler-monk) typical of fable logic but slightly convenient for strict causality. The closure works beautifully as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but a constraint; the bamboo forest and wild orchard provide the physical materials (sap, isolation) that dictate the protagonist's method. The sensory details ("moss so thick it swallowed sound") are specific and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes—connection versus oblivion—are established early and escalated through the physical toll of the work ("hands ached," "seasons folding"). The cost is visible in the "daily expenditure of life," making the final reunion feel earned despite the fable-like mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of communication transcending language is expertly woven into the core concept of the "raveling silence." The ending resonates powerfully, transforming the central motif from something destructive (unraveling) to something whole (complete).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly tuned to the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective stays close to Sable’s tactile experience, filtering the world consistently through her weaver’s eye.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("bamboo knocked its hollow music"). The phrase "stoically sparkling" is slightly clunky compared to the surrounding high-quality prose, but the overall line-level craft is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central conceit—weaving a tapestry from mismatched jigsaw puzzle pieces—is a striking, original synthesis of craft and desperation. It reinvigorates the trope of the "message in a bottle" with tactile, fresh specificity.</comment>
