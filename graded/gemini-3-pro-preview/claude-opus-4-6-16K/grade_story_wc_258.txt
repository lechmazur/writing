<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moira is sharply drawn through her specific obsession and physical deprivation ("eating from cans," "eleven weeks"). The choice to confide in Davi marks a decisive shift from isolation to shared burden, effectively using the relationship as a crucible. Her interiority regarding the "failure of myth" is distinct and drives the narrative logic without lapsing into exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arcs cleanly from solitary accumulation to a "Charged Poise" closure where the next historical cycle is locked in. The drive lens (Accumulative shifting to Causal) holds firm, and the orientation is immediate. The ending reconfigures the premise—the map is no longer just a record of the past, but a burden of the future—with clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The loft is an active participant; the floor space and lighting ("rain... beading across the skylight") constrain and define the physical work of the map. Sensory details like "turpentine," "onyx ink," and the "yellow measuring tape" ground the abstract economic concepts in a tactile reality. The atmosphere of "inherited rooms" perfectly supports the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated: the tension between rational analysis (Davi) and mythic archetype (Moira). Escalation occurs when Davi enters and challenges the work, forcing Moira to crystallize her theory into a prediction ("the next turn is already forming"). Davi's capitulation ("Show me") deepens the shared risk rather than resolving the tension cheaply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptocurrency economics and tarot archetypes ("Spiral of Borrowed Certainty") is sophisticated, creating a resonant answer to the central question of why systems collapse. The "unfinished Empress" serves as a potent, non-literal symbol of future desire. The theme avoids didacticism, letting the "geometry" of the map speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and lyrically precise ("intervals of collective sentiment"), effectively merging the vocabulary of data with the lexicon of divination. The POV remains tightly anchored in Moira’s perception, filtering the world through her specific obsession. The distance is well-calibrated, allowing for both intellectual scope and immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is exceptional, using parallelism ("ink had outlasted the woman... secrets had outlasted common sense") to build momentum without artifact loops. Information density is high, with every sentence advancing character or atmosphere. The imagery ("braided fresh patterns," "root system") is consistently organic, reinforcing the central metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of treating economic bubbles as folklore cycles mappable by tarot is striking and executed with grounded specificity. It avoids the clichés of both cyber-thrillers and urban fantasy, offering a fresh "archaeological" approach to digital collapse. The synthesis of the physical (tape/ink) and the digital (crypto) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
