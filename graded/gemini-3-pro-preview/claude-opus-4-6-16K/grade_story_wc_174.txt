<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The deconstruction of Marcus's "serenity" as a performance of control is a sophisticated character beat that deeply grounds the ending. His transition from defensive stillness to terrifying vulnerability feels earned and consistent with his background as a calligrapher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly wound, using the "reversal" notch on the story stick as a physical fulcrum to pivot the psychological stakes. Closure is decisive and lands with the visible cost of Marcus admitting fault and abandoning his artistic safety.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The radar dome is utilized masterfully, not just as a backdrop but as a thematic resonance chamber; the "halved skull" and "broken receiver" imagery perfectly amplifies the subtext of broken communication and listening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Internal escalation is strong, moving effectively from the static "hush" of the aftermath to a high-stakes reconfiguration of the protagonist's life work. The felt cost—trading control for a "terrifying" collaborative uncertainty—is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the protagonist's two lives—calligraphy and puppetry—into a new ethical framework ("holding the frame") creates deep thematic resonance. The story explores the ethics of storytelling without dissolving into abstraction or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, perfectly matching the "urbane" and "precise" temperament of the protagonist. The shift in rhythm during the epiphany maintains the established voice while signaling internal change.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and precise, with high information density and no scaffold; phrases like "halved skull" and "elegant certainty" do heavy lifting. The repetition of "half-lit" works as a motif, though it sits on the edge of becoming an artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a calligrapher, a radar dome, and a Navajo story stick creates a unique, specific texture. The resolution—shifting from teller to facilitator—feels fresh because it is filtered through the specific metaphor of calligraphy.</comment>
