<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margit is a distinct, well-realized focalizer whose reticence acts as a meaningful constraint throughout. Her final choice to exceed her word limit and actively participate in the chain represents a clear Decisive Change with symbolic cost. The motivation to "bottle safety" is effectively dramatized in the epiphany, though the simile comparing her to a "warmly observant mother" feels slightly external to her established solitary nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure is strong and resonant, but the structure is extremely front-loaded with summary; the first ~50% of the text narrates 23 years of history and the letter chain's origin before anchoring in the present scene. While this context is vital, the heavy ratio of summary to dramatization distances the reader and exceeds the standard reflection/backstory ceiling for this length. The transition to the specific night at Skardvik is clean, however, and the ending lands effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and precise, functioning almost as a character; the "milky green of a held breath" and the "Atlantic breathing against the glass" create a palpable atmosphere. The lantern room is rendered with sensory specificity that heightens the ghostliness of the moment. The environment meaningfully pressures the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes of isolation versus connection are clearly established and escalated by the discovery of the letter chain. The physical injury of the keeper provides necessary situational pressure to force Margit into the lantern room alone. The turning point—moving from observer to participant—is earned, though the external pressure (injury) is a somewhat convenient device to enable the internal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of shared silent burdens is beautifully integrated into the plot mechanics (the cairns, the glass, the letters). The final line, "It was never heavy," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question without descending into heavy-handed moralizing. The "luminescent ache" perfectly captures the intended emotional duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, effectively mirroring the protagonist's reticence and the story's atmospheric weight. The POV stays firmly with Margit, filtering observations through her specific lens ("rationed" words like fresh water). Control of distance is excellent, zooming in smoothly from the 23-year summary to the intimacy of the match-lit room.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm and imagery ("braid of unsigned confessions"). There is a slight tendency toward "purple" phrasing ("architecture of a child's silence," "milky green of a held breath") that risks drawing attention to the author rather than the character, but the overall craft is high. No mechanical artifacts or drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (lighthouse isolation, silent stoicism) into a fresh configuration through the specific mechanism of the letter chain and stone codes. While the "silent guardian" trope is recognizable, the execution—particularly the use of the supply route as a physical thread for emotional connection—feels distinct and well-earned.</comment>
