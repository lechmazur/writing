<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, thoughtful protagonist whose internal shift from hoarding to releasing is well-motivated by the specific constraints of her parole. The psychological arc is coherent and the transition from thief to witness feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The structure effectively utilizes the shop's "lull" to stage the pivotal moment of reading the ghost-text. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end is valid, the explicit explanation of the realization dampens the closure's immediate power.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard is an exceptional setting that actively shapes the narrative; the transparency and light are not just atmosphere but functional mechanics that enable the character's epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is present through the use of the "loophole" and the reading of the ghosts, though the conflict remains largely internal. The external threat of the parole board feels distant, keeping tension simmering rather than boiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "absence as beginning" is provocative and well-threaded, but the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis ("stories begin not with..."), reducing narrative resonance to a moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, precise, and well-tuned to the ethereal setting ("swirling sea of clouds"). Narrative distance is managed effectively, blending observation with deep interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative with high information density ("paper thin as shed skin"). No mechanical loops or artifacts; the rhythm supports the contemplative tone without dragging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of selling "clean slates" that retain ghost-text residue is highly original, and the world-building around the glass library feels fresh and specific.</comment>
