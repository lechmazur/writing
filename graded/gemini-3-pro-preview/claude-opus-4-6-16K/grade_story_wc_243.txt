<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marguerite is a distinct, competent professional whose internal life is well-aligned with the story's action. Her motivation is clear, though slightly over-articulated in exposition ("She did this work because...") rather than purely dramatized through friction. The "haunted euphoria" moment leans on labeling emotion rather than embodying it, but her dedication carries the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from setup to execution with a strong sense of purpose. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the restored document reclaims space in the world—lands effectively. The backstory of the flood is integrated well via the "proximate causes" method, linking past betrayal to present restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active and atmospheric; the "blooming jetty" and "amber light" aren't just backdrop but integral to the ritual of restoration. The sensory details of the walnut ink and tannin bath ground the abstract historical stakes in tangible reality. The environment charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (memory vs. erasure), though the on-page opposition is passive (fading light, aching knees) rather than active. The pressure relies heavily on the internal/historical weight rather than immediate obstacles, but the pacing sustains tension well enough for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of preserving small moments against grand narratives is resonant but delivered somewhat didactically through narrator explanation in the second paragraph. The story would be stronger if the theme emerged solely from the act of restoration and the "proximate causes" discovery without the direct thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately reverent for the subject matter. It creates a cohesive mood, though occasionally dips into abstraction ("impossible coexistence of grief and wonder") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate physical action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong specific imagery (walnut ink, violet clusters). However, the phrase "haunted euphoria" is a label-heavy abstraction, and the final triplet ("The jetty bloomed. The water lapped. The covenant breathed.") feels like a rhythmic template artifact that draws attention to itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of archival restoration as a form of defiance is fresh and handled with laudable specificity. The blend of technical detail (tannin, walnut ink) with the emotional weight of the covenant creates a unique and memorable narrative angle.</comment>
