<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent professional with a clear motivation ("restoration of a voice"). However, her internal landscape is delivered largely through exposition ("She was a ghost whisperer") rather than dramatized struggle, and the climax relies on a calm realization rather than a high-pressure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative coheres well as a moment of synthesis, but the pivotal deduction relies on off-page backstory ("Maren had cross-referenced... found a discrepancy") rather than an immediate on-page discovery. This retroactive plotting lowers the causal tension of the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is rendered with sensory precision ("wet suit peeled to her waist," "scattered into pale constellations"). The setting effectively charges the final image, where the ice walls carry the voice upward, fulfilling the "charged image" requirement for high marks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes (justice for the dead) are high, but the immediate scene pressure is low; Maren is safe in her shrine, arranging evidence. The escalation is intellectual and retrospective, lacking a present-moment obstacle that forces a tactical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "windows of connection" is woven elegantly through the clues and the final image. The message about "restoration of a voice" is slightly explicit ("She was not seeking comfort... trying to expose"), but the resonance at the end is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident and atmospheric, handling the shift between technical details and lyrical reflection well. The "dream triangulation" method is explained with clarity and specific imagery that defines the narrative perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("half-collapsed like a jellyfish") and rhythmic control ("borrowed starlight"). The density of information is high, and the writing avoids scaffold or loops, supporting the ethereal tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of "ghost whispering" via cross-referencing dream cameos is a genuinely fresh and ingenious take on the genre. While the "corporate cover-up" plot is familiar, the unique method of investigation elevates the story significantly.</comment>
