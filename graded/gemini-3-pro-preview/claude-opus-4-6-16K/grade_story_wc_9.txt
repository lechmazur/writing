<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is fiercely specific; the "wound" of an unwitnessed life dovetails perfectly with the inciting incident of birth. The final renunciation—choosing the daughter over the craft—is earned by the scene’s pressure and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A flawless arc from the "annihilating moment" to a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's worldview. The ending serves as both a Conceptual Repricing of "lost time" and a Decisive Change in life path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the logic; the glade is not merely a location but the physical manifestation of the story’s core concept (accumulated time). Sensory details like the "rain that had never touched soil" are evocative and precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Internal stakes are existential and palpable, pitting professional identity against maternal presence. The resolution forces a meaningful trade-off, accepting that the "lost years" are irrecoverable except as beauty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thematically rich, though the explicit definition of "Cloudbound repentance" in the penultimate paragraph leans on summary to crystallize meaning rather than trusting the dramatized image alone. The resonance remains strong despite this slight didactic touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting the "onyx-ink" aesthetic. Interiority remains tightly bound to the protagonist's specific perception without head-hopping or leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic ("climbing until the earth forgot her"). A few adjective pairs ("raw, annihilating," "cold and alive") are slightly standard, but the overall line-level craft is excellent and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of cartomancy, magical realism, and postpartum grief. The invention of the hand-tracing ritual grounds the magic in a unique, tangible family history.</comment>
