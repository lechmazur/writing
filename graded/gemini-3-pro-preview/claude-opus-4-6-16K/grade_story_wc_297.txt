<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sable is a distinct focalizer with a compelling descriptor ("root-bound"), but her interiority relies on summary ("She understood that now") rather than dramatized processing. The "anxious elation" is labeled rather than embodied, and her agency is reactive to the maze's initiation until the final step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible, but the central pivot—realizing her scars match the maze after 11 years—reads as a convenient epiphany rather than an earned discovery. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, but the inciting incident (hedges shaping themselves) does most of the heavy lifting for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vibrant and active, acting almost as a second character. Imagery like "spirals that mimicked nerve endings" and the "cobalt glade" creates a strong, dreamlike atmosphere that grounds the surreal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily situational and low-friction; the maze invites Sable, and she accepts with minimal resistance. The "terror" is stated but not felt on the page, and the stakes of "unbinding" feel inevitable rather than fought for.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of the artist merging with the creation is handled well, and the "intersection" concept resonates. The ending leans slightly into abstract metaphysics ("dreamer and dream refused to remain separate") but fits the established tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, suiting the fable-like quality. The POV remains close to Sable, though it occasionally slips into explanatory telling to bridge gaps in logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished with good rhythm, though "cobalt" is repetitious (used three times for the environment). Some phrases like "dusk settled like silk" lean toward cliché, while "key sank into her skin as though her hand were soil" is excellent and visceral.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The body-horror aspect of the key and scars elevates a familiar "magic garden" trope. The synthesis of the physical body as a map of the unconscious offers a fresh, specific image.</comment>
