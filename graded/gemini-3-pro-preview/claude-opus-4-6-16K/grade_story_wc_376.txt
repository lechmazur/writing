<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lien’s specific physical reaction to dishonesty creates a compelling, embodied internal conflict. However, her sudden pivot from delicate calligrapher to floorboard-prying adventurer feels slightly disjointed from her established capability set.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on "video game logic" to advance the plot; finding a shredded treasure map under floorboards in a specific ruin based on a zinc plate is a convenient contrivance that strains causality. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path there lacks earned logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Veridium is rendered with excellent sensory specificity, from the pipe condensation to the "gossamer" gold leaf. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, with the toxic sky and drying oasis framing the stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but the external opposition is minimal; the protagonist faces little resistance in retrieving or publishing the letters. The conflict remains largely atmospheric rather than interpersonal or systemic, reducing the tension of the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of candor as a vital resource is well-integrated and lands with a resonant final image. While slightly explicit in its moralizing ("Candor... was the aquifer"), the emotional logic holds together well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the setting. The focus remains tight on Lien’s perception without unmotivated head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong image density ("brass mouths open like small, expectant faces"). The pacing is controlled, though the map discovery sequence feels rushed compared to the careful descriptions elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a truth-sensitive artisan in a glass city is imaginative, but the inclusion of a literal "shredded treasure map" feels like a forced trope that clashes with the story's otherwise grounded melancholy tone.</comment>
