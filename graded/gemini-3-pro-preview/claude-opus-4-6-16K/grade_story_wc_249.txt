<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct focalizer with a clear, singular motivation that drives the scene. Her "quietly rebellious" nature is well-dramatized through her unauthorized presence in the garden, though the lack of conflicting internal impulses or doubt makes her emotional arc feel slightly static and linear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear causal chain where Maren's actions directly produce the resolution. While the closure is decisive and validates her agency, the absence of active obstacles (the doctors are asleep) removes friction, making the outcome feel somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden is an excellently realized setting that functions as both atmosphere and tool, satisfying the "micro-setting" constraint. The specific mechanics of the space (crystalline stalks, membrane walls) are integrated directly into the protagonist's method, grounding the abstract concept of memory entanglement in tangible, sensory action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scene escalates through a density increase—from sound to light to manifested memory—but lacks active opposition to ratchet up the tension. With the antagonist pressure (doctors) removed for the night, the conflict remains largely atmospheric; the "cost" is present (aching sternum) but low pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of human connection transcending clinical protocol is clearly articulated and lands effectively in the final image. The resonance is slightly dampened by the explicit definition of the emotion ("auroral sorrow... grief of loving") at the climax, which analyzes the feeling rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a controlled, lyrical voice suited to the setting. The narrative distance is appropriate, keeping the focus on Maren's perception of the sound and light without slipping into unmotivated omniscience or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished with vivid sensory details ("warm fog," "copper lip"). A minor synonym loop appears at the climax ("auroral sorrow... luminous, dawn-colored grief"), where the text restates the emotional tenor in adjacent clauses rather than advancing the action, momentarily stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes (entangled minds, coma communication) with a fresh, specific interface (the sound garden). While the emotional beats follow a standard trajectory, the "audio-visual architecture" concept adds a layer of ingenuity that elevates the execution above a standard hospital drama.</comment>
