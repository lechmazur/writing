<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara is drawn with high interiority and competence, but she lacks internal contradiction or significant struggle; the "fiercely meditative" trait appears as a backstory label rather than a dramatized active state. The spectral mentorship reduces her agency slightly, as the grandmother's hands smooth over the difficulty of the task, resulting in a character who faces no genuine risk of failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure effectively builds toward a resonant closure, with the finished stone and departing monarchs providing a solid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Across the weeks...") to traverse the core action, reducing scene-level immediacy in the middle section, though the closure remains legible and costly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the greenhouse's "iron bones greening" and "clouded like cataracts" creating a vivid, specific atmosphere that constrains the protagonist's method. The interaction between the crumbling architecture and the living butterflies is tangible and directly serves the central metaphor of grief's structure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the stakes of collective grief are high, the narrative lacks active resistance; the ghost, the ribbons, and the butterflies all align to aid Elara, smoothing the path to success. The conflict remains internal and abstract, without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or where the protagonist must pay a steep price for the result.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief having "architecture" is developed beautifully through the structural butterfly motif, moving beyond sentimentality into a complex synthesis of weight and flight. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise of collective mourning without resorting to a simple moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, matching the spectral and artistic subject matter with a distinct perceptual signature. The meditative tone creates a cohesive "thundering calm," though the reliance on summary in the middle slightly distances the narrator from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("sediment settles after a river floods"), maintaining strong momentum. A few phrases lean toward the poetic-familiar ("silence so full it roared"), but the line-level craft is generally precise, evocative, and free of distracting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravestone carver, spectral mentorship, and a butterfly greenhouse is fresh and memorable, avoiding generic ghost-story tropes. The specific detail of the "ribbon roll" and the concept of a "topology of shared mourning" elevate the premise above standard fare.</comment>
