<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mirela is a consistent anchor, but her internal landscape is delivered via narrator summary and diagnostic labels ("proud enough," "desperate enough") rather than embodied struggle. While her persistence drives the community response, she functions more as a noble archetype than a flawed individual making difficult trade-offs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on montage and broad time-skips ("fifth month," "within a week," "another three months") which distances the reader from immediate scene pressure. The resolution to the scarcity crisis—donors appearing externally—lowers the causal stakes and feels structurally convenient for a story of this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and the "amplified quiet" create a distinct, resonant atmosphere that grounds the piece effectively. The physical setting is well-integrated with the theme of silent dignity, providing a strong container for the action despite the summary mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The primary conflict of starvation is resolved by external forces (anonymous donors) rather than the protagonist's agency, which undermines the narrative tension. While Mirela addresses the social friction of pride, the actual "cost" of the sanctions is mitigated too easily by the convenient influx of aid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of dignified charity is clear but delivered didactically through Mirela's speech summary ("spoke of intergenerational support"), which explains the meaning rather than letting it emerge. The resonance is saved by the strong final image of "accumulated silence," but the middle section relies too much on stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fable-like voice is consistent and polished, suiting the "legend" tone of the narrative with good rhythmic control. The distance is maintained well, though it sometimes leans into abstraction ("pride could sleep") that softens the visceral reality of the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and clean, with strong imagery ("ribs of some ancient creature") that establishes tone quickly. However, the reliance on passive constructions ("Children began to thin") and summary telling limits the dramatic density and propulsion of the line-level work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story executes a familiar humanitarian fable competently but lacks a sharp, original twist or a deep subversion of the trope. The resolution feels safe and standard, offering a comforting outcome without the complexity or risk that distinguishes top-tier literary fiction.</comment>
