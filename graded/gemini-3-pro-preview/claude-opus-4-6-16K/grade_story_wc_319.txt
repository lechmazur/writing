<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and vivid, grounding the "feral" attribute in a specific cognitive state ("foggy lucidity"). However, the explicit telling of the character's motivation ("Her motivation was simple and impossible...") undercuts the dramatization of her desire.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece functions well as an atmospheric vignette with an "Earned Stasis" closure that validates the protagonist's passive agency. The middle section relies heavily on reflective exposition to establish stakes, slowing momentum slightly before the traveler's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally integrated, functioning as both atmosphere and archive; the "books in the wall" and "frozen garden" constrain the character's method and ground the abstract dimensional concepts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal and atmospheric; while the traveler's arrival provides a necessary focal point, the conflict remains low-voltage as the protagonist's choice is to maintain stasis rather than engage directly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty resonates through the final image of the shifting light. The score is capped by the explicit statement of the theme in the narrative ("She wanted to make friends with uncertainty"), which reduces subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, matching the "foggy lucidity" of the protagonist without sacrificing clarity. The perspective remains stable and authoritative regarding the character's complex internal state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("inhaling continues exhaling"), with strong rhythmic control. The phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is slightly abstract and repetitive, but the sensory imagery ("breath from a sleeping mouth") is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of library and multiverse tropes; the "frozen garden" library and the specific concept of "dimensional homesickness" regarding light quality create a unique, memorable mood.</comment>
