<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation to reclaim her art through thermal mapping is compelling and drives the narrative. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on a summary montage ("Over the following weeks...") to resolve the core trauma, rather than dramatizing the breakthrough moment on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a strong setup but dissipates tension by summarizing the pivotal confrontation with the "capsizing" memory in a middle montage. While the final image of the wind as a downbeat provides resonant closure, the structural decision to elide the most difficult part of the process weakens the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is an excellent, integral setting that creates the necessary conditions for the protagonist's work. The physical details ("dampening film," "ribs of some enormous sleeping beast") actively constrain the character and enforce the central conflict of silence versus noise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Escalation is largely absent from the scene work; the story skips from the initial test to the finished success via summary ("Over the following weeks, Maren filled notebooks"). Hiding the mapping of the specific trauma (the capsizing) in a summary list robs the narrative of its necessary dramatic peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of translating trauma into a new sensory language is handled with sophistication. The ending successfully recontextualizes the protagonist's relationship with the world, turning the "noise" of the wind into a musical element she can accept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, fitting the "composer" persona. However, specific metaphors (e.g., a tuning fork "splintering") break character consistency, as a composer would know tuning forks (metal) do not splinter like wooden boats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose has rhythm but suffers from mixed metaphors that disrupt physical logic ("splintered like a tuning fork struck against stone") and some stock imagery ("blade drawn across exposed nerve"). While polished, these artifacts undermine the precision expected of a story about acoustics and sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core concept of heat-mapping emotions to compose music for the hyperacusic is inventive and vividly realized. It offers a fresh, specific approach to the "artist overcoming disability" trope.</comment>
