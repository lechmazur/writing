<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sable functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character; she lacks internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or a distinct interior voice in scene. The "strangers to kin" dynamic is delivered via summary backstory rather than dramatized through relationship pressure or dialogue. The protagonist encounters no meaningful resistance to trusting the ghost, rendering her choices automatic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on broad summary ("months," "three quiet harvests") to bridge events, violating the short story scope in favor of a fable-like recounting. This summary mode flattens causality; instructions are given and followed without complication, failure, or the "felt cost" required for a high-band closure. The ending is a symmetric satisfaction where the problem is solved exactly as planned, lacking a decisive turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "mineral rain" and "floating rock arches" grounding the fable logic in specific physical details. The imagery is consistent and atmospheric ("violet haze," "exhaled dust"), though the environment functions more as a static resource container than a source of active pressure or constraint on the characters' choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Tension is low because the central conflict (blight) is solved by a trustworthy supernatural guide who removes the need for difficult decision-making or trade-offs. The escalation is additive (more people join) rather than a tightening of options; luck and external aid resolve the crisis without a distinct price paid by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit assertions ("cuts communal," "Its true motivation was...") and a final message that states the moral directly ("YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN"). This overt didacticism leaves little room for subtext, ambiguity, or the organic emergence of meaning from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable mode, maintaining a steady mythic tone. However, the distant third-person perspective creates an emotional barrier, keeping the reader in a position of observation rather than visceral experience, and the "we" feeling is asserted rather than built through voice distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but leans heavily on ornamental metaphors ("ribs of some slumbering god," "brambled with the memory") that sometimes reduce immediacy. While rhythmically competent, the density of figurative language occasionally creates a "purple" effect that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story executes a standard "healing the land" trope with competence but plays it safely within familiar genre conventions. The concept of a ghost teaching gardening is pleasant but lacks a sharp, non-obvious synthesis or a risk-taking narrative choice that would elevate it beyond a standard fable.</comment>
