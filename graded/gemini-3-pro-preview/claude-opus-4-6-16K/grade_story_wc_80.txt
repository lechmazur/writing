<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, well-rendered protagonist whose professional duality (day surveyor vs. night archivist) creates immediate depth. The "pressure against her sternum" successfully grounds her abstract motivation in physical sensation. Her choice to preserve the specific line from the journal demonstrates a coherent internal philosophy of accepting loss rather than fighting it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Accumulative drive, layering details of the ritual until the discovery of the journal provides a decisive deepening. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the pavilion "almost remembering how to dance" effectively recontextualizes the decay as performance rather than just ruin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, functioning as both constraint and character. The specific physical realities—the rising tide, the "dusk of brackish water," the need to find cracks for the notes—shape every on-page action. The environment actively charges the final image, earning the high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (memory vs. erasure), but it is felt keenly through the "vertigo" of meeting the predecessor. The discovery of the 1921 journal provides a clear escalation, transforming her solitary cataloging into a dialogue with the past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "elegant, necessary losses" is woven seamlessly through action and image rather than exposition. The predecessor's line—"It will be beautiful, and it will go"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of erosion, perfectly executing the conceptual repricing required for the highest scores.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and precise, matching the protagonist's "stoic" nature. The transition from the dry technicality of the day job to the lyrical "low fire" of the night work is handled with excellent control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density ("copper shingles green and blistered"). The fire motif ("hushed blaze," "thin fire," "conflagration") is consistently applied to the underwater setting, creating a distinct atmospheric texture without slipping into incoherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a surveyor cataloging the spiritual history of a submerged ballroom via structural repair notes is highly original. The synthesis of technical surveying language with the poetics of decay feels fresh and specific.</comment>
