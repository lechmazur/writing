<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin’s internal landscape is rendered with precision; the trait of being "chronologically homesick" is not just a label but the engine of her artistic struggle. The transition from fortune-cookie aphorisms to symphonic notation feels earned and consistent with her mathematical/musical mind. The physical toll of her creativity ("hands trembled," "edges of vision softened") grounds the intellectual motivation in bodily cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure effectively builds pressure through the race against dawn and exhaustion, leading to a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is distinct: the completion of the score transforms her relationship with memory from "homesickness" to "remembering forward." The orientation is immediate, and the causal link between her past (grandmother's shell) and present method is tightly woven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the glass spire and frozen lake are not mere backdrops but optical instruments that mirror the protagonist’s internal duality ("suspended between two identical expanses"). The final image of the spire becoming a prism charges the closure with a visual manifestation of her completed work. Specific details like the "key of wet stone" anchor the abstract concept in sensory reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and environmental, pitting artistic ambition against physical limitation and the fleeting nature of the "last darkness." While lacking interpersonal friction, the stakes are felt through the somatic cost of the work. The "tightening" occurs effectively as the dawn approaches, forcing the protagonist to crystallize her memories before the light changes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of translating silence and memory into a communicable form is handled with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed morals. The distinction between "compression" (fortunes) and "composition" (symphony) offers a nuanced thematic arc. The ending resonates by expanding the personal act of memory into a universal "waiting world" without dissolving into abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice possesses a distinct, lyrical authority that mirrors the protagonist’s precise, slightly detached artistic temperament. The seamless blend of mathematical logic ("spiral’s mathematics") and poetic imagery ("memory’s negative space") creates a consistent perceptual signature. There is no filter-verb clutter, and the psychic distance is perfectly calibrated for a story about internal composition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that matches the musical subject matter. Images like the spire standing "like a tuning fork struck and forgotten" do double duty, establishing atmosphere and theme simultaneously. The text avoids loop artifacts and cliché, maintaining propulsion even during reflective passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a fortune cookie writer composing a symphony of silence is genuinely inventive and deftly executed. The synthesis of the nautilus shell’s geometry with musical notation offers a fresh metaphor for time and memory. The story avoids the trap of the generic "tortured artist" by grounding the struggle in specific, unique methodology.</comment>
