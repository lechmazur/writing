<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is sharply drawn, contrasting exhaustion with a "dirty" pragmatism that drives choices. The vulnerability shown to the delegates is a distinct, earned micro-choice that pays off, though the internal monologue occasionally leans on diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong, utilizing the conjunction as an effective pressure cooker to force resolution. However, the climax relies on a summary of "three hours of argument" rather than a dramatized turning point, distancing the reader from the pivotal moment of persuasion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting acts as a functional constraint; the shadow on the meridian mark and the converging planets create a tangible clock. Sensory details like the thumb-worn groove in the ebony clipboard ground the ritual in history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and high, with the cost of peace (amnesty, displacement) clearly articulated and felt. The pressure of the celestial timeline effectively forces the antagonists' stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of accepting "adequacy" over perfection is woven seamlessly into the plot and final image. The "beautiful ugly thing" resonance at closure perfectly reconfigures the premise of peace without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, weary authority that suits the protagonist. There is slight register friction with clinical phrases like "pharmaceutical intervention" against the ancient/torchlit aesthetic, but the tone remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, with high density. The reliance on aphoristic summary ("meaning did not need to be true to be useful") slightly flattens the immediacy of the scene's middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A fresh, mature take on the negotiation trope that avoids the cliché of a perfect solution. The focus on the "dirty ledger" offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis of the prompt elements.</comment>
