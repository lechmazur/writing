<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose interiority ("grammar of mystery") aligns well with the premise. However, her acceptance of the high-risk bequest is instantaneous, lacking a moment of genuine struggle or weighing of the "lawyers" threat, which makes the motivation feel slightly functional rather than fully earned character work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly with Maren accepting the mission, but a significant continuity error disrupts the central mystery logic. Paragraph 3 states the envelopes bore numbers "1, 2, 3, and now 4," while Paragraph 7 claims they bore "7, 3, 1, 4" to justify the combination; this contradiction breaks the reader's ability to track the puzzle's causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting of the converted mill house is evocative and specific, with sensory details like the "murmured" brook and "green smell of growing things" effectively grounding the atmosphere. The environment actively supports the tone of the mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from an intellectual puzzle to a corporate threat, which works well for the length. The conflict resolution is relatively low-pressure—opening a lock and accepting a notebook—but the shift in scope provides sufficient momentum for the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "botanical automata" versus corporate restriction is innovative and well-integrated. The ending successfully resonates with this theme, positioning nature and patience against the "locked away" logic of the antagonist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately observant for a puzzle designer. It manages the transition from mystery to revelation smoothly, though the narration is complicit in the factual confusion regarding the envelope numbers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality and dense ("translucent as fish scales"). However, the mandatory phrase "across the hush of a possibility just born" is inserted awkwardly, creating a purple, rhythmic stumble, and the "storm-born silence" reprise feels repetitive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of living plants as escape room mechanisms is genuinely ingenious. However, the execution of the "orthogonal" puzzle—merely sorting numbers in ascending order—is disappointing and standard compared to the "lateral, diagonal" promise of the premise.</comment>
