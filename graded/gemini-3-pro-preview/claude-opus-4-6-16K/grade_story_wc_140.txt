<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's resignation is active rather than passive; choosing not to correct the error creates a compelling internal logic. Her final decision to write in the third person is a specific, character-defining choice that earns the "Earned Stasis" closure. The "texture of memories" motivation is abstract but is dramatized effectively through her eavesdropping method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds firm, building a portrait of erasure that culminates in a decisive act of self-archiving. Closure is a poignant Conceptual Repricing of her own life as fiction, with the felt cost being the surrender of her first-person authority. The transition from the summary of her routine to the specific "high tide" scene is smooth and structurally sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative rhythm; the tides dictate the protagonist's movement and safety, functioning as a narrative clock. The "metal cathedral" and "labyrinth" imagery effectively mirror the rust and decay of the collected lives. The specific location of the "blue container near the eastern seawall" grounds the abstraction in concrete reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure deepens from the collection of others' lives to the confrontation with her own unverified past. The shift to writing her own entry serves as a meaningful tightening of her stance, foreclosing the return to the living world. While the external conflict is low-key, the internal stakes regarding identity and memory are clearly escalated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of documentation versus reality is explored with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The final decision to write in the third person perfectly crystallizes the thematic question of what constitutes a "real" life. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central premise of erased histories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and observant, fitting the "ghost" persona well. The transition into the meta-commentary on the "third person" is handled with impressive control, maintaining the story's atmospheric spell. The perceptual signature—hearing texture over meaning—is distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric with high density ("bleeding rust," "moisture and forgetting"). The rhythm supports the contemplative mood without stalling momentum. Line-level craft is strong, though a few descriptors lean slightly into standard literary register.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "clerical error" premise with the specific "container yard observer" role is fresh and evocative. The specific detail of the "third person" shift elevates the concept beyond a standard "living ghost" trope. The execution feels distinct and purposeful.</comment>
