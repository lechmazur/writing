<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sable is a competent, distinct focalizer, but her stoicism borders on opacity; she lacks a dramatized internal contradiction or "crucible" moment. Her motivation is clear ("puzzle out new equations"), but the struggle remains intellectual rather than visceral, with emotional stakes stated in summary ("quiet desire to matter") rather than shown in conflicting choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure relies heavily on a summary bridge ("Over the following weeks") which diffuses the tension of the initial discovery. The closure—a "feasibility study"—is realistic but lands with low dramatic impact; the cost is bureaucratic rather than personal or felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of "neon rigs" and "synthetic cotton candy" against the abandoned terminal is vivid and specific. The "functionally creative" improvisation of the water systems grounds the sci-fi elements in tangible, tactile engineering details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely abstract and professional; the "municipal board" is a faceless off-screen antagonist that generates little immediate pressure. The escalation occurs mostly in the summary montage, preventing the reader from feeling the risk of failure in a specific, high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection through repurposing is resonant, but the execution leans on explicit telling ("equations for hope," "intention is the first coordinate"). The subtext of the carnival's transient joy seeding permanent survival is excellent, but the "maze" reflection feels like an inserted prompt rather than an organic realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of "stoic intensity" that fits the protagonist and setting well. There are moments of effective lyrical precision, though the narrative distance sometimes keeps the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density ("snythetic cotton candy machines," "jury-rigged... hydraulic drainage"). Occasional lapses into cliché ("numbers... sang") or slightly overwritten metaphor ("converged like old water") detract slightly from an otherwise crisp delivery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core premise—an abandoned spaceport revitalized by carnival leftovers—is fresh, functionally grounded, and metaphorically rich. It avoids the standard "ancient alien artifact" tropes in favor of a creative civil engineering solution, which is a standout choice.</comment>
