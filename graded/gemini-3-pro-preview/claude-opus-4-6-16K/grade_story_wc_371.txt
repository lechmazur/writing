<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is exceptional; Maren’s "affliction" of noticing drives the plot naturally toward the tea house. Her internal state is rendered with precision ("indispensable to no one"), and the transition from observer to participant at the climax feels fully earned by the scene's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, leading to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where Maren commits to the resistance. A minor continuity friction exists between the "handful of meetings" backstory (implying established contact) and the "found what she had been told to look for" phrasing (implying a first-time discovery), but the closure is powerful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active rather than static; the garden itself serves as a coded map, directly influencing the protagonist's journey. Sensory details like "moss felting the marble stairs" and the "ghost of sweetness" in the jasmine vividly ground the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate effectively from the abstract pain of memory loss to the concrete, biological threat of the "new flour." The conflict deepens from passive observation to active refusal, and the choice to "start with the cracks" represents a tangible, costly shift in tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic integration is superb. The distinction Sable draws between "undoing" (impossible) and "uncloaking" (resistance) offers a nuanced, non-binary resolution to the central problem. The final image of the stale bread as sacrament perfectly crystallizes the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a melancholic but sharp tone throughout. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Maren’s experience of "creeping normality," filtering the world convincingly through her hyper-observant lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm ("stone the river couldn't smooth"). The required phrase "heuristically gentle" is slightly register-jarring against the lyrical backdrop, but the surrounding text ("approaching every truth sideways") smooths its integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes of dystopia and memory loss into a fresh configuration through the specific lens of guerrilla gardening and sourdough starter. The "new flour" mechanic provides a grounded, original explanation for the societal forgetting.</comment>
