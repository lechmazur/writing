<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose "rogue scholar" persona drives the resolution. However, much of her characterization relies on summary backstory in the first half rather than dramatized action, and her internal conflict is resolved somewhat quickly with the "laugh" beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing where the threat is redefined as a tool, satisfying the causal lens. However, the structure is heavily front-loaded with exposition (~50% of the text) before the active scene begins, which delays momentum and violates the preferred show-don't-tell balance for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful; details like "naphthalene," "cracked glass," and "pinned moth specimens" create a specific, atmospheric texture that reinforces the theme of preservation and invisibility. The greenhouse feels lived-in and essential to the plot's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stakes are high and the escalation (the bio-acoustic sensor) provides excellent pressure. The resolution is clever and conceptually satisfying, though it leans on a "eureka" moment that bypasses some of the visceral cost or struggle usually required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of organic, messy life outmaneuvering sterile algorithmic control is well-executed and resonates in the final image. The concept of resistance taking root "older and wilder" lands effectively without feeling overly moralistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, sharp, and consistent, matching the "rogue scholar" focalizer well. The transition from the expository voice to the immediate scene is handled smoothly, maintaining the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good rhythm, but occasionally drifts into overwrought metaphor ("silence colonized the greenhouse," "converging chaos... nearly buckled her"). These moments of density slightly drag on the otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of floriography (flower language) with bio-surveillance is a fresh, specific twist on the familiar "thought police" trope. The premise feels distinct and the execution avoids the most generic pitfalls of the genre.</comment>
