<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, highly competent professional whose interiority ("stillness look like a choice") is specific and grounded. Her motivation is clear and consistent, though she lacks the contradictory internal impulses or warring desires typically required for the highest bands; her struggle is one of precision rather than internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building density through the ritual of preparation to a resonant closure. The ending functions as a Charged Poise, where the "crystalline quiet" reconfigures the relationship between the living and the dead. The cost is subtle—an offering of presence and time—but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally integrated, functioning as a constraint on the action (the shifting aurora light affecting the foundation shade) and a participant in the climax. The "hollowed geode" provides a sensory-rich environment that charges the final image of static and stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and professional, centered on the successful completion of a final wish. While external conflict is low, the anomaly of the warm chip introduces a beat of pressure that Maren navigates with agency. The escalation is atmospheric, fitting the meditative mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of agency in death ("choice rather than a theft") is woven organically through the specific actions of the beautician. The closure offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise, achieving a "radiant hush" that feels earned by the prior attention to detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, precise, and consistent, perfectly mirroring Maren's "lucidly watchful" state. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through the lens of patterns and anatomy without slipping into generic description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and lyrical ("parenthetical lines around her mouth"), with strong rhythm and no visible scaffolding artifacts. The description of the static and the aurora supports the tone without becoming purple or obstructing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—a mortician working in the upper atmosphere on a physicist who grew sky-crystals—is fresh and specifically realized. The synthesis of technical craft and atmospheric wonder creates a unique texture that feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
