<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s specific trade (mourning jewelry) grounds her grief in tangible action, creating a unique filter for her observations. The shift from paralysis to creation is earned through the accumulative process of the origami prompts, resulting in a deeply embodied transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure (origami to observation to insight) builds steady pressure toward a legible closure. The ending—creating a piece for herself and descending—is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration that accepts the cost of returning to time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "perpetual dusk" acts as a functional constraint, effectively mirroring Elara’s internal stasis. The specific tools of her trade (copper, glass, filters) anchor the setting in labor and tactile detail rather than just visual description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but critical: the recovery of agency and craft. The escalation moves cleanly from passive viewing to active interpretation, culminating in the physical act of creation that breaks the stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy (light as a ghost) and mourning jewelry (artifice holding absence) is exceptional. The core concept of "genuinely artificial" emerges organically from the mechanics of the telescope and works perfectly as the thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic precision ("photons were real; the image was a ghost"). The close third-person perspective filters the cosmic scale through an artisan's specific, tactile vocabulary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and high-density ("folds rippling with intention"), though the transition "Days passed, or what she assumed were days" relies on standard scaffolding. The pacing of the imagery remains strong and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise combines two distinct domains—astronomy and Victorian mourning crafts—into a novel, cohesive metaphor. The "genuinely artificial" paradox offers a fresh, intellectually satisfying angle on the traditional grief narrative.</comment>
