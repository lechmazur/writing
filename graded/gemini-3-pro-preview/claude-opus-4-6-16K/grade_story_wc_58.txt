<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is unique and compelling, but she functions more as an observer than a character under pressure with contradictory impulses. Her internal landscape is thematic rather than conflicted, lacking the messy specificity of a lived struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The accumulative drive works well, building atmosphere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The summary bridge ("Over the following days") slightly dissipates immediate scene pressure, but the structure remains cohesive and the ending lands with conceptual clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vethara is rendered with evocative, specific imagery ("harbor turned to glass," "bruised light") that anchors the mood. The garden serves as a strong, constraining micro-setting that mirrors the characters' internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are largely conceptual and the conflict is quiet/internal, lacking high kinetic pressure or difficult active choices. The deepening of intimacy provides momentum, but the "cost" is philosophical rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("proof that what we love does not leave us"), triggering a Thematic Echo deduction. The text relies on telling the reader the moral ("That is the entire point") rather than trusting the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly suiting the melancholic tone. The perspective remains stable, though it occasionally filters the world through slightly self-conscious "writerly" observations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with strong imagery ("facts like gifts"), though some metaphors feel slightly strained ("leaves falling... like slow, deliberate punctuation"). The rhythm is sophisticated and supports the pacing well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of "obituaries for the living" is genuinely fresh and offers a strong lens for the story. The execution leans on familiar tropes of the lonely caretaker and ruined garden, but the synthesis is effective.</comment>
