<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Adaeze’s internal state ("hollowness," "forgetting sickness") is perfectly externalized through her interaction with the roots and bones. The transition from engineer-logic to spiritual engagement is earned through specific sensory encounters rather than abstract epiphany. Her final choice to offer the kola nut feels like a genuine, costly admission of her own brokenness, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Accumulative arc, building density through the discovery of the sundial and the specific bone arrangements. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the "first green thread" recontextualizes the "interrupted journey" not as failure but as a new mode of living. The timeline is compressed effectively, and the "fourth day" anchor provides necessary structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" is a masterclass in bio-architectural setting that constrains choice: the roots literally hold the protagonist’s workspace together. The sensory details—"cool bark," "ghost-shape of water," "fruit-light"—are specific and govern the atmosphere. The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary antagonist and ally combined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and thematic rather than visibly high-octane, but the pressure of the "forgetting sickness" provides sufficient drive. The escalation moves from professional detachment to intimate ritual participation. The cost is subtle—an emotional surrender of her professional distance—but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "interrupted journeys" is powerfully realized through imagery (roots, Nsibidi). However, the explicit articulation of the thesis ("Every journey here had been broken. Every journey had continued anyway") is slightly on-the-nose and preempts the reader's own synthesis, preventing a higher score. The ending image resonates beautifully without this crutch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly controlled, matching the protagonist’s observant nature. The modulation between technical observation (load-bearing walls) and spiritual intuition ("reading the tomb") is seamless. No head-hopping; the psychic distance is expertly managed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with zero scaffold or fluff. Phrases like "faith becomes a word without weight" and "pale fingers threading through dark hair" land with precision. Rhythm varies effectively between the instructional (engineering) and the lyrical (spiritual), supporting the hybrid drive of the story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of structural engineering with indigenous spirituality in a "catacomb orchard" is a fresh, specific conceit. It avoids the generic tropes of diaspora return stories by grounding the emotional arc in a unique, tangible physical constraint (the root-bone symbiosis).</comment>
