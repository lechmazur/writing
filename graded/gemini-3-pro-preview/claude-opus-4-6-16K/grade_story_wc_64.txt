<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s characterization is anchored in specific professional traits ("blithe devotion," "seeds take forty years") that organically drive the plot. Her motivation—a blend of "grief and curiosity"—is dramatized effectively through her interactions with the grave goods, creating a distinct and compelling internal engine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the game's expiration to the decoding and the final realization. Closure is achieved through a decisive change in knowledge and intention (Conceptual Repricing), with the discovery of the coordinates effectively recontextualizing the game as a map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo provides a vivid, atmospheric container that actively frames the scene ("faintly blue," "starlight poured"). Sensory details are specific and grounded, such as the "confession the ground could no longer hold" and the chemical stain, enhancing the "out of time" quality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Coherent internal pressure drives the decoding process, satisfying the need for escalation within the intellectual stakes. While external opposition is static, the felt cost of the "velveteen gloom" and the weight of the forty-year silence provides sufficient tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gardening motif ("some seeds take forty years to bloom") resonates powerfully at the closure, tying the protagonist's identity to the central theme of delayed intention. The concept of the game as a "conversation in uncharted echoes" adds depth without feeling forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent, modulating smoothly between the mechanical details of chess/decoding and the lyrical interiority of the protagonist. The perspective remains tightly filtered through Margot’s specific worldview ("lighthouse keeper," "gardener").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong, evocative imagery ("stone dropped into deep water," "confession the ground could no longer hold"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to support the pacing of the discovery, avoiding artifact loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess notation, tapestry encoding, and the cemetery setting creates a fresh, specific angle on the "message from the grave" archetype. The mechanical specificity of the knot-to-square mapping elevates the concept above generic puzzle tropes.</comment>
