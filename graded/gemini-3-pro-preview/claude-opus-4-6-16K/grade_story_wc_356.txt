<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s internal conflict between control (journaling) and acceptance is sharply drawn and dramatized. The transition from resistance to surrender is earned through the interaction with the specific sensory details of the seed, though the epiphany feels slightly rapid. The "olfactorily sensitive" trait is not just a label but a driver of perception and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure where Maren renounces her previous method. However, the pivotal turn relies on a "sudden understanding" sparked by a memory rather than a forced tactical choice under pressure, which slightly softens the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is exceptional; the olfactory details ("resin and rain," "carrion sweetness") actively constrain Maren’s experience and force the climax. The setting is integral to the plot, and the physical environment charges the final image of the bloom spreading across the treetops.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (peace of mind/mastery) is signaled early and tightened by the intrusion of the smell. The resolution involves a clear, on-page renunciation of the journal—a visible cost to her established character—offering a satisfying closure to the internal struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "blooming through rot" is well-integrated with the objective correlative of the corpse flower. The recurring motif of "thinking with your fingers" bridges the gap between intellect and instinct effectively, landing a resonant, non-moralizing conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, filtering the world consistently through Maren’s heightened sense of smell and analytical mind. The shift from clinical observation to lyrical acceptance is handled smoothly within the single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative ("moved like wind... snapping things"), but marred by occasional tautologies ("unnervingly acute, olfactorily sensitive") and the slightly bureaucratic verb "journalize," which clashes with the otherwise lyrical texture. Information density is good, but these slips disrupt the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a herbalist in a treetop village is a familiar trope, but the specific focus on olfactory mastery and the corpse flower adds a fresh sensory layer. The synthesis of the doodle method with the plant's growth provides a nice, specific twist on the "letting go" narrative.</comment>
