<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is tightly woven into the premise; Elara's profession (cuneiform translator) provides the specific lens through which she engages with the magic and her grief. The trait "kindly methodical" is not merely a label but governs her climactic emotional release ("Elara wept, kindly and methodically"), creating a unified and resonant portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative logic is established early through the "analogical thinking" rule-set, which pays off flawlessly at closure when the seed functions as a method of translation rather than a cure. The ending lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, validating the protagonist's journey with clarity and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting of the magnetic arbor is vividly specific ("cathedral of living iron," "hummed in her teeth") and acts as a functional constraint on the ritual. The physical properties of the space—static, magnetism, amber light—are inextricably linked to the plot's progression and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Internal pressure is high and coherent, driven by the "haunted ambitions" and the grief for Tomasz. While the external opposition is minimal (man vs. nature/metaphysics), the tightening of the stakes—realizing the seed is a method, not an answer—provides a satisfying escalation and felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of death as translation—a shift in medium rather than a cessation—is executed with exceptional grace, avoiding heavy-handed exposition. The synthesis of linguistics and physics creates a resonant subtext that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a precise, scholarly elevation that perfectly suits Elara’s perspective. The modulation between the technical description of the arbor and the raw intimacy of grief is handled with excellent control, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("nested metaphors... like doors in a corridor"). The writing avoids artifacts and maintains momentum, effectively grounding abstract concepts in concrete sensory details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, blending ancient cuneiform scholarship with speculative electromagnetism in a fresh way. The story avoids standard tropes of necromancy by framing the interaction with the dead strictly through the lens of translation and text.</comment>
