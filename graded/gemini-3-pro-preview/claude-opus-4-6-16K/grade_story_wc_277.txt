<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s "observatory of conscience" is brilliantly rendered, grounding the abstract concept of regret in specific, habitual action. The internal contradiction—using her father’s lying pen to write the truth—creates a sophisticated, embodied irony that defines her character arc. The choice to abandon silence is earned through the rigorous, character-specific logic of the "proof by contradiction."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "proof by contradiction" mechanism functions perfectly as rising action, turning a mental calculation into genuine plot propulsion. The closure is decisive and earned, shifting from the stasis of "she always said she would call back" to the concrete, irrevocable action of mailing the proof. The narrative drive is tightly causal, with the inciting call leading directly to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is active rather than static; the "ghostly repetition" of sound and the "thinning atmosphere" directly serve the theme of inescapable truth. The physical details of the dome opening mirror the character's internal opening to intervention, and the "second sea" of clouds provides a striking visual counterpoint to the moral wreckage below.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are elevated by the specific cost of dismantling the "dead man's architecture," turning a phone call into a betrayal of family legacy for the sake of integrity. The pressure escalates cleanly through the logical deduction to the physical act of sealing the envelope, making the internal conflict visibly manifest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of "orbits of regret" is sustained without becoming heavy-handed, seamlessly blending astronomy with moral accountability. The theme resolves not in abstract moralizing but in the physical weight of the ink and the descending letter, achieving a resonant reconfiguration of the "family empire" concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a precise, slightly detached elegance that fits an astronomer-heiress, modulating perfectly into the "grim smile" of the climax. Control of psychic distance is absolute, zooming in on the pen nib's history and out to the stars with thematic purpose, never slipping into unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with lines like "lights... flickered like a promise someone forgot to keep" doing double duty for setting and theme. There is no scaffold; the rhythm of the "nib scratched... dome echoed" conclusion lands with high impact and excellent cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical logic, journalistic ethics, and astronomical imagery creates a genuinely fresh narrative frame. The concept of using "proof by contradiction" to process family grief and corporate guilt is a unique and compelling angle that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
