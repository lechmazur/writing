<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is tightly anchored in professional expertise; the bone-setter's tactile worldview effectively shapes her interiority and perception. The shift from skepticism to yearning is rapid but earned by the specific, visceral evidence of the tooth. Maren's forgiving nature creates a seamless bridge to the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality is precise; the inciting incident (tooth) directly motivates the journey, and the protagonist's skill set solves the obstacle (maze). Closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration that satisfies the premise with clear conceptual cost—abandoning the safety of the known world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, particularly the "clean snap" and "slow persuasion" metaphors. The garden environment blends the organic with the "humming" technological, effectively grounding the prompt's tone requirement in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and personal, escalating from a diagnostic puzzle to a world-altering choice. The pressure in the maze is resolved somewhat easily through metaphor, which slightly dampens the tension of the middle beat, but the final trade-off is weighty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing broken alignments integrates flawlessly with the narrative action; the bone-setting motif elevates the standard changeling trope into a resonant commentary on fixing "crooked" histories. The ending offers a non-literal, emotionally charged answer to the central problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, filtering magic through a medical/structural lexicon ("articulating," "enamel," "structure"). The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining intimacy with Maren’s internal processing without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high-functioning metaphors that serve multiple duties (characterization, plot advancement, and atmosphere). No scaffold or friction; the line-level craft supports the story’s "flawless" ambition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bone-setter protagonist with a fae changeling plot offers a fresh, specific texture to a familiar archetype. While the changeling narrative beat is traditional, the execution through the lens of medical skepticism adds significant ingenuity.</comment>
