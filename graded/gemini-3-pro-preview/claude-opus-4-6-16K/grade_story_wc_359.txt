<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s synesthesia is deeply embodied, grounding her motivation in visceral experience rather than abstract duty. The internal "tightness" provides a clear emotional stake that resolves through the climax, though the release is somewhat rapid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean arc that shifts from ritualistic accumulation to a causal decision at the final strike. The physical alteration of the resin sheet effectively anchors the metaphysical "proof" in a tangible, resonant closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the ice cavern functions as both atmosphere and instrument, literally shaping the sound and color. This integration of environment and tool meaningfully constrains the protagonist's choices and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Conflict focuses on the "blank measure" as a gap between potential and form. While the internal pressure is clear, the external opposition is minimal, relying on the static challenge of the sheet rather than active resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme is resonant, but the explicit statement ("wonder was not ornamental. It was structural") feels didactic. The narrative proof demonstrates the theme well enough that this overt telling reduces the subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and strictly focalized through Maren’s synesthetic perception. The transition from technical observation to wonder is handled with consistent, elevated tone that fits the fable-like quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and polished ("temperature that sang," "sculpted hush"), with precise sensory imagery. The rhythm is controlled and maintains momentum through the description-heavy middle without stalling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of certifying wonder through a fossilized song played on ice is fresh and imaginative. The synthesis of aurora, sound, and resin creates a unique and memorable conceptual frame.</comment>
