<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; Sable’s internal landscape is coherently rendered through craft-specific metaphors ("reading wood grain," "centering clay") that ground the speculative elements in her lived experience. Her final choice to stay is a natural, earned extension of her established traits (patience and the need to shape), fulfilling the 9+ requirement for choices rooted in deep character logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, where observation deepens into realization without needing forced external conflict. The closure—a Decisive Change where she commits to building a kiln—lands with conceptual weight, effectively reconfiguring her future and the setting’s meaning. The transition from mystery to understanding is smooth and logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is exceptional ("mineral smell," "thin blade of shade"), transforming the setting from a backdrop into the active puzzle the protagonist must solve. The environment meaningfully constrains the epiphany; the specific interaction between the sun, the hive box, and the lens anchors the abstract concept in tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily conceptual—entropy vs. resilience—but are made felt through the physical "thrum" and the scarcity of the wasteland. The deepening of the mystery via the lens provides sufficient pressure to justify the life-altering decision to remain, though the internal conflict is relatively low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of care as a stabilizing force is resonant and well-integrated into the story's physics. The explicit articulation of the thesis ("Phototropic to kindness") borders on a Thematic Echo, stating the subtext too directly, but it is successfully grounded in the character's memory of a botany text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, meditative control that perfectly matches the protagonist’s potter persona. Focalization is precise, moving seamlessly from visual observation to internal processing and somatic sensation ("entered her sternum") without head-hopping or distance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic, free of loop artifacts or scaffolding. Imagery is functional and vivid ("diverging futures laid over one another like transparent maps"), advancing the narrative argument while maintaining a distinct aesthetic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping, pottery, and temporal mechanics offers a fresh, specific variation on the post-apocalyptic survivor trope. The "timeline lens" is an ingenious device that makes the abstract theme of resilience visually and causally actionable.</comment>
