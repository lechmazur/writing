<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vael is a highly competent protagonist whose professional lineage drives the action, but she lacks internal contradiction or significant emotional cost beyond physical endurance. While her reverence for the work is clear, the absence of a struggle against her own limitations makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal lens: problem, diagnosis via ice, and resolution via the stone. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (chaos to coexistence), though the resolution feels slightly mechanical—the energy beings capitulate immediately upon the "conjuring," smoothing over the climax too convenienty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "sonic geology" setting is excellent, with sensory details that act as genuine constraints on the character's actions (e.g., reading ice fractures to map invisible sound). The environment is not just a backdrop but the antagonist and the puzzle combined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tension is well-maintained through the physical assault of the sound and the urgency of the task. However, the conflict resolves with a "magic key" moment that bypasses a final struggle; the beings' transition from screaming to whispering happens without a negotiated cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of translating noise into language and finding "coexistence" rather than domination is resonant and well-executed. The ending successfully reframes the conflict, moving from a battle against intrusion to a mapping of new peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, fitting the "harmonic" subject matter perfectly. The focus on sensory translation (sound to touch/sight) creates a cohesive perceptual signature for the mapkeeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and polished, but the mandatory prompt phrases ("gently luminous," "bloom of hush") are repeated verbatim multiple times (four distinct uses of "gently luminous"), creating a checklist-like stutter that detracts from the otherwise high-quality line craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustics, geology, and magic creates a fresh and specific premise. The method of reading ice cracks to find acoustic interference patterns is an ingenious detail that grounds the fantasy in a quasi-scientific logic.</comment>
