<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is sharply defined by physical trauma ("burned hands aching") and professional paranoia. The shift to Kaplan feels slightly convenient as a resolution to the "who" problem, but the thematic link to "unused courage" earns the choice within the character's logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the closure—destroying the temporary code to act on the permanent proof—is a decisive change. The "vertical archaeology" of the snow code strains physical suspension of disbelief (lateral shifting during melt would likely scramble a grid), but acts as a potent poetic mechanism that serves the story's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the decryption mechanism itself; the melt determines the timing and legibility of the plot. The sensory details ("licking a river stone," "silver hush") effectively ground the atmospheric tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stakes are high (treason, survival), though the pressure is largely retrospective and atmospheric rather than immediate opposition on the bluff. The internal escalation toward the decision to trust Kaplan provides sufficient narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of "vouchsafe" is beautifully integrated, moving from a code word to a thematic definition of trust. The parallel between the snow revealing truth and the protagonist emerging from hiding resonates without feeling heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctly atmospheric, matching the protagonist's careful, scarred existence. The transition from observation to resolution is handled with confident pacing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring. Occasional phrases verge on the precious ("tasted of cardamom and endings"), but the overall density and rhythm are high-quality and propel the scene well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central conceit—a time-released message encoded in the sink-rates of objects in snow—is highly original and visually striking. It transforms the standard "dead drop" trope into something fresh and season-dependent.</comment>
