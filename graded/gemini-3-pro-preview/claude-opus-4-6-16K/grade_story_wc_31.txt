<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deep and precise; the conflict between his "wall of facts" and the emotional necessity of the vow is dramatized beautifully through the physical descent into the wreck. The protagonist’s endurance of the cold and tide serves as a felt cost that earns the final realization, anchoring the "luminous" change in visceral experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure relies on a perfect convergence of constraints—the lowest tide and the lantern festival—creating a Situational lock that forces the climax. Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the key tag transforms from a memento of loss into a tool of continuity ("a frequency to keep carrying").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the sunken library is not just a backdrop but the specific acoustic mechanism that resolves the plot. The environment actively constrains choice (tide access) and enables the sensory epiphany ("resonance chamber"), integrating atmosphere and causality seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and escalates through the specific constraints of the timeline and environment. While the antagonist is abstract (silence/grief), the physical danger of the rising tide and the biting cold provides a tangible counter-pressure that grounds the metaphysical stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "luminous vows" is woven into the narrative logic rather than stated as a moral; the transition from memory to presence is handled with sophistication. The concept of sound having color evolves from a playful dialogue memory into a concrete physical reality that resolves the arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct, melancholic precision that fits the lamplighter persona perfectly. The shift from the factual grounding of the opening to the synesthetic magical realism of the ending is managed with confident control, keeping the reader anchored in the protagonist’s perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-value imagery ("lanterns lifting like slow meteors in reverse," "sculptures of pulp and salt") that serves the atmosphere without stalling momentum. The rhythm varies effectively between the methodical lamp-lighting and the fluid, resonant experience inside the hull.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—a lamplighter, a sunken ship library, and a synesthetic festival—creates a highly original narrative space. The specific mechanism of the hull turning crowd noise into color offers a fresh, non-obvious execution of the "color of sound" prompt.</comment>
