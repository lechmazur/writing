<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nadia is a compelling focalizer with a distinct, trauma-informed worldview that bleeds into her scientific perception ("Every equation was a body"). However, the epiphany in the penultimate paragraph ("She understands it. She is it.") veers into diagnostic label-speak, explicitly categorizing her internal state rather than trusting the dramatization of the hunt to convey the parallel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the cooling cycle as an effective ticking clock that frames the inciting incident and resolution. The closure functions as a strong Conceptual Repricing: by saving the coordinates to a private drive, she reclaims the "potential" from the institution, actively subverting the missile-response logic established in her backstory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the stratospheric observatory providing a stark, cold backdrop that mirrors Nadia's internal isolation. The geode acts as an excellent micro-setting element, grounding the abstract cosmic hunt in a tangible, sharp object that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, pitting Nadia's need for meaning against the indifferent, weaponized machinery of her world. The tension escalates naturally with the cooling timer, and the decision to withhold the data represents a meaningful tightening of her stance against the status quo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central metaphor of "unused potential" is poignant and organic to the premise, but the execution suffers from a heavy-handed Thematic Echo near the end ("A survivor is a pool of unused potential"). This explicit summarization of the story's thesis deflates the subtextual power built by the preceding action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the protagonist's specific scientific and traumatic lens. The integration of physics terminology with emotional landscape creates a unique perceptual signature that remains stable under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high-quality imagery ("Crystals like frozen light, like compressed patience") that serves both atmosphere and character. The rhythm varies effectively with the pacing of the hunt, and there are no significant artifacts or loops to impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravitational physics, drone warfare trauma, and a stratospheric setting offers a fresh and specific angle on the theme of grief. The concept of hunting for "stillborn stellar nurseries" as a coping mechanism is an ingenious metaphorical engine.</comment>
