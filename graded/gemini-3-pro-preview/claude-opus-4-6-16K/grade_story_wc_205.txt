<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s internal landscape is vivid, with the parallel between her revolutionary past and the Vasari’s poetic resistance providing strong motivation. However, her agency is largely summarized through retrospective narration rather than tested in an immediate, high-pressure scene. We are told of her struggle rather than witnessing a pivotal choice that defines her character in real-time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary to span four years of research and the "storms" phase, violating the short-story scope default of a dramatized scene. While the causal logic holds, the structure reads more like a synopsis of a longer arc than a contained event. The closure is resonant, but the path to it lacks on-page scenic traction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the "baroque asteroid" with its gilded surfaces and "amber currents" of visible time is both atmospherically rich and structurally integral. The specific environmental detail of covering mirrors to prevent time refraction is a brilliant fusion of world-building and plot resolution that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear but academic, and the conflict with Dr. Leath is distant and filtered through backstory. The escalation occurs intellectually through summary ("She worked through temporal storms") rather than through immediate danger or cost faced on the page. The victory feels inevitable because the struggle is recounted rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of impermanence and the specific parallel between a forgotten revolutionary and a misunderstood civilization are handled with grace. The "syntax of devotion" concept lands powerfully, and the ending reconfigures the protagonist's "defunct" status into an act of defiant preservation without heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently elevated and melancholic, suiting the "burnished sorrow" of the protagonist. Narrative distance is controlled well, filtering the baroque surroundings through Maren’s specific expertise and history. The tone remains cohesive, though the reliance on summary flattens the immediate emotional texture slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("cherubim carved from iron ore," "time pooled thick as honey") that serves the atmosphere. Rhetorical flourishes ("This changed everything. This changed nothing") provide rhythm, though they occasionally underscore the summary nature of the telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of visible time is familiar, but the specific application—architecture as prosody and the covering of mirrors to stop temporal refraction—is genuinely ingenious. The "lonely scholar vindicating the past" frame is standard, but the execution elevates it with fresh, specific details.</comment>
