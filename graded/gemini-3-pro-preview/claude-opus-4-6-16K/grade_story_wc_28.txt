<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is sharply defined ("empathy given structure") and drives the central action with clarity. The protagonist's internal state—balancing the "steel" of discipline with the softness of grief—is vivid and compelling. The backstory regarding the "scholars" feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of the present moment, but the character's agency is undeniable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from contact to vision to resolution with strong internal causality. The closure ("Resonant Reconfiguration") lands effectively, shifting the weight of the past through a concrete ritual act. The progression is smooth, perhaps slightly too linear, but the conceptual payoff at the end is earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the "fractured dome" sets the tone, while the mosaic tile acts as the specific mechanism for the story's magic. The description is evocative ("blue tiles glow like something almost alive"), effectively grounding the metaphysical action in physical detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the psychic cost of bearing history—is clear and escalated by the revelation of the specific erasure ("renaming"). The pressure is largely internal; while the deepening of knowledge is effective, the resolution faces little active resistance from the object or memory itself, reducing tension slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of "aberrant mercy" and the final insight that "wounds... become architecture" provide deep resonance. However, the narrative occasionally relies on explicit thematic statements ("empathy unhoused was just sentiment") rather than trusting the dramatization fully, which slightly flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately elegiac for the subject matter. The close third-person perspective manages the transition between the physical plaza and the retrocognitive vision without confusion, maintaining a distinct textural signature throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with effective imagery ("cracked like porcelain"). There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Selin felt," "She understood") and some expository scaffolding ("That was the term..."), but the final image and the "architecture" metaphor are executed with high craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry with a specific act of linguistic restorative justice is fresh and poignant. The core detail—a name hidden in the tessellation of a mosaic by a grieving artisan—is a genuinely ingenious specific that elevates the familiar post-apocalyptic frame.</comment>
