<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, capable protagonist whose specific trait ("precisely humane") drives a unique resolution—curation rather than mere mourning. Her internal shift from duty to act of witness is credible and well-dramatized through the handling of the photographs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving logically from the inciting silence to the exhibition. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration of the space. The only slight dip is the summary transition ("Over the following weeks") which creates a brief distance during the resolution phase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The physical reality of the surfacing town is exceptionally vivid, particularly the "mud... silver-gray" and the "barnacled" rooftops. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, transforming from a passive reservoir into an active historical site.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict between memory and erasure is compelling, though the lack of on-page resistance from the "county officials" makes Maren's victory feel slightly low-risk. The cost is well-rendered atmospherically (the permanent silence) but less so interpersonally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of water holding "narrative" is resonant and beautifully integrated. The score is capped slightly because the story explicitly states its thesis ("spin its stories into shared meaning... reckon with the taste") rather than letting the exhibition speak entirely for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, melancholic authority that fits the warden persona perfectly. The modulation between clinical terms ("inundation") and lyrical observation reinforces the central tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished and rhythmic. A few metaphors lean heavily on personification ("steeple... finger raised to ask," "whispered apology"), but the information density and image clarity remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "drowned town" is a familiar trope, but Maren's constructive response—turning the landscape into a museum rather than a haunt—provides a fresh, humanistic angle on the material.</comment>
