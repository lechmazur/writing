<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vividly anchored in physical action ("productive fidgeting"), creating a distinct character presence. However, the final epiphany relies on diagnostic summary ("understood that the tapestry's final lesson was...") to articulate the arc, explaining the subtext rather than letting the dramatized moment carry the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Excellent causal structure; the tapestry solution is established early and pays off decisively at closure with a clear Decisive Change. The resolution delivers a Conceptual Repricing of the premise—redefining the "game" from winning to survival—that effectively earns the cost of the seven-year exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen village is a vivid, functional setting that constrains the protagonist's reality; sensory details like the "glass beads" of rain and "flour cloud arrested in bloom" create a high-pressure atmosphere that serves both plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible and high (exile, guilt), and the internal pressure of the seven-year wait charges the quiet physical climax. The resolution meaningfully reweights the dominant stake, moving from a desire to "undo" the mistake to a deeper understanding of endurance and survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of patience and atonement are well-integrated into the plot mechanics. However, the explicit thematic summation in the final reflection ("It was the patience required...") acts as a Thematic Echo that reduces the resonant power of the ending image by treating the subtext as text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, matching the "woven hush" of the protagonist's focus. The perceptual signature is distinct, consistently filtering the world through the lens of a chess tutor's analytical yet guilt-ridden mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("crystallized into silence"). Rhythmic control is excellent, using purposeful repetition ("Pull, read, release") to mirror the weaving motif without becoming a stylistic artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of the "frozen time" trope; utilizing the decay of the tapestry border as the specific mechanical key allows for a non-obvious, tactile resolution that grounds the magic system in the story's unique reality.</comment>
