<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren is characterized with high professional specificity; her background in framing and cartography effectively filters her perception of the damage. The internal shift from "conservationist" to "witness of the scream" is earned through her methodical attention. The distinction between perception and attention establishes a specific worldview that pays off at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory into a Conceptual Repricing closure. The causality is tight: the acoustic quirks justify the silent video method, which forces the visual-only discovery. The closure—re-mapping the chapel as a site of pain rather than peace—lands with distinct conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot logic; the acoustic properties of the henge stones necessitate the silent video method, binding place to process. The damp atmosphere is palpable and creates a ticking clock of decay that pressures the observation. The "cup-and-ring" marks provide a deep-time boundary that contextualizes the medieval erasure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (sanctioned history vs. revealed truth) rather than interpersonal. While the pressure of the rain/decay is coherent, the stakes remain somewhat abstract until the final realization. The closure works as a stance crystallization, though the personal cost to Maren is quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "mapping the unknown/erased" is woven seamlessly through the protagonist's profession and the plot mechanics. The "tear in the map" serves as both a physical location on the wall and a thematic threshold. The ending resonates powerfully, reframing silence not as peace, but as a suppressed scream.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical precision that matches the protagonist's "methodical" nature. The control of psychic distance is excellent, zooming in on the pixelated details of the fresco and pulling back to the atmospheric weight of the chapel without jarring shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("worked the painted plaster the way grief works a face"). Rhythm varies effectively between the technical descriptions of the video feed and the atmospheric observations of the chapel. No scaffolding or loop artifacts detected; the imagery is fresh and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, conservation, and Neolithic acoustics creates a fresh narrative frame. While the "palimpsest revealing a hidden emotion" is a recognizable literary trope, the specific execution involving silent video comparison and the "tear in the map" metaphor elevates it significantly.</comment>
