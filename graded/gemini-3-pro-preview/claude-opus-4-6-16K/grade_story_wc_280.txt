<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marguerite’s characterization is exceptional; the specific sensory details of her synesthesia ground her ghostly nature in a vivid, embodied reality rather than generic ethereal tropes. The decision to relinquish her single possession—the lucky coin—is a precise, high-cost micro-choice that perfectly dramatizes her shift from nostalgia to intervention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and potent, using the established mechanics of the orchard to drive the climax without breaking causality. The closure is distinct and resonant, with the transfer of the coin serving as a tangible "Resonant Reconfiguration" of Darla's fate, though the "inexplicably open" gate leans slightly on convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated with the POV; the "silver-barked apple trees" and "humming" fruit are not just backdrop but active participants in the magic system. The use of synesthetic description ("tasted of cinnamon and electric blue") transforms the environment into a constraint and a tool for the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high (implied suicide versus hope), effectively tightened by the synchronization of breath and song. The pressure remains coherent under the situational lens, and the resolution is earned through the protagonist's sacrifice of her only anchor to her past life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of artistic legacy and connection bridging the gap between life and death is delivered with nuance, avoiding sentimentality. The dual nature of the tarot coin (Fool/Tower) serves as a perfect, non-discursive symbol for the choice between "possibility" and "falling."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and disciplined, maintaining the "synesthetically blessed" filter consistently. The transition to Darla’s perspective is handled cleanly as a shard cut, though the brief shift away from Marguerite’s unique sensory world slightly lowers the immersive intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Lines like "fractured... layering like transparencies" and "applause tasted of warm bread" demonstrate excellent control of image and cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a synesthetic ghost, a time-fracturing orchard, and the "harmonic" singing mechanic offers a genuinely fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. The concept is executed with a specificity that elevates it above standard "helpful ghost" narratives.</comment>
