<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maret is a compelling protagonist whose past as a curator organically drives her present motivation to preserve culture. The internal landscape is vivid, particularly the "fossil" metaphor at the end, though the "rosewater dread" feels slightly like a labeled emotion rather than a purely embodied one.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is flawless, moving efficiently from the inciting shortage to the adaptive solution. The foraging expedition is summarized briskly to focus on the ritual, which serves as a profound closure unit (Conceptual Repricing) where the cost of the change is acknowledged and accepted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the lack of sunlight and soil necessitates the tuber substitute, directly shaping the central conflict. The sensory details ("silver veil," "mineral deposits," "blind fish") are distinct and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stakes are high—cultural erasure versus survival—and are escalated effectively by the ticking clock of the missing beekeeper. The resolution involves a meaningful trade-off: the form of the ritual is saved, but the substance (taste/texture) is irrevocably altered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation and memory is handled with sophistication, avoiding simple nostalgia. The final image of the "thaw" inside the "unending syllable" of the waterfall resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal answer to the problem of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent, matching Maret's educated background. There is a strong control of psychic distance, though occasionally the prose dips into slightly self-conscious poeticism ("scattered them like seeds").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and evocative ("familiar branches under her thumbs"). A minor deduction for the "historian" label ("understood this with the precision of a historian"), which summarizes insight that is already dramatized by her actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a specific bread-shaping ritual to mourn the dead is a fresh and poignant synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes and cultural preservation. The execution feels personal and specific rather than generic.</comment>
