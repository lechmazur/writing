<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren is a competent, distinct protagonist with rich interiority and a clear professional drive. Her motivation—finding meaning in ruin—is consistent and compelling, though her success in the scene comes relatively easily, lacking the "crucible" pressure that forces a difficult character-defining choice. The backstory regarding the star fragment is slightly expository but grounds her worldview effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from ascent to attunement to release. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration ("Begin again"), validating her cyclic existence with a sense of earned stasis. While the scene lacks a sharp causal twist, the orientation is solid and the linear progression fits the procedural nature of the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the "jaw of broken teeth" and the "hum" of the platform creating strong atmospheric pressure. The environment actively constrains Maren's movement and mirrors the signal's vibration, charging the scene with tactile detail. The description of the gorge and towers is immersive, though the score is capped by the lack of high-stakes conflict utilizing these elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The scene functions as a successful extraction mission with minimal opposition or doubt. While the atmospheric intensity escalates (the vibration, the thinning static), Maren faces no significant obstacle or risk of failure that forces a tactical trade-off. The cost is abstract (a life of solitude) rather than an immediate price paid on the page to secure the signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings is well-integrated through the central metaphor of the null signal and the star fragment. The "shard of hush" resonates as a spiritual counterweight to the physical ruin. The ending successfully recontextualizes the mission not as a discovery but as a ritual of maintenance, reinforcing the thematic argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent elevated register that matches Maren’s interpretive trade. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through frequencies and vibrations. The lyricism generally supports the tone, though occasionally it risks becoming slightly detached from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic, with standout images like the "tuning fork" and "jaw of broken teeth." However, a few stock metaphors—"antenna... like a skeletal finger" and the "sculptor/marble" comparison—detract from the otherwise fresh imagery. The line-level control is strong, but these artifacts prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "celestial signal interpreter" seeking silence rather than noise is a refreshing inversion of post-apocalyptic tropes. While the "ruined city" setting is familiar, the specific focus on acoustic theology gives it a unique texture. The synthesis of elements feels organic, even if the plot arc is somewhat standard.</comment>
