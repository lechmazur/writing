<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is a static vehicle for the plot, possessing total competence without internal conflict or flaws. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("to salvage something pure") rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and she faces no personal risk during the narrative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The resolution relies on a "God Mode" narrative summary where complex legal accountability is achieved instantly via dream insertion. This breaks causality, as the director's unshakeable certainty and the resulting investigation are unearned by the on-page action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe serves as a vivid, specific anchor that grounds the supernatural elements. The glacial shrine offers a distinct atmospheric backdrop, though the setting acts more as a stage than a source of constraint or pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>There is virtually no active resistance; the antagonist (The Company) is abstract and defenseless against the protagonist's magic. The "exhaustion" cited as a cost is a generic label that does not impact tactics or outcomes, leaving the stakes purely theoretical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of corporate accountability is delivered through on-the-nose exposition ("traded lives for profit margins") and a tidy summary ending. The lack of moral complexity or ambiguity reduces the thematic resonance to a simple binary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone suitable for the genre, though it leans toward melodramatic descriptors ("terrible clarity," "sunken prisons"). The narrative distance is stable, keeping the focus on Elara's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but relies on summary ("she always weaves truth carefully") rather than dramatized scene work. Clichés like "shattered like ice" and "calloused hands" dilute the freshness of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" and the "melted snow globe" tool are imaginative, the plot structure is a derivative procedural resolved by a magical deus ex machina. The synthesis lacks a fresh twist on the "ghost reveals murder" trope.</comment>
