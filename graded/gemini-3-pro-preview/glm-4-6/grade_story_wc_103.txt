<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Internal conflict is legible, but the characterization relies on abstract labels ("retrocognitively trapped") and melodramatic rhetorical questions ("salvation or his doom?") rather than embodied emotion. The wife functions as a prop for grief rather than a character with distinct memory-texture, reducing the emotional weight of the loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent with a clear Decisive Change at the climax that severs ties to the past. Causality holds firm; the protagonist's action directly dismantles the setting and resolves the conflict, satisfying the closure requirement with a tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "living bridge garden" is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong backdrop for the surreal logic of the piece. However, the "hyperbolic geometry" acts more as a repeated descriptor for "twisting paths" than a distinct spatial constraint that forces unique tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the garden resists the protagonist's advance. The physical resistance of the maze successfully mirrors the internal struggle, though the obstacle feels slightly generalized until the final confrontation at the tree.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of letting go is resonant, but the text explicates its subtext too directly ("labyrinth of his own fractured mind"), flattening the reader's discovery. The final image of the "texture of time" attempts a conceptual repricing but feels slightly ornamental given the prior explicit telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately moody, though it leans toward "purple" descriptors ("shimmering sliver of heaven," "quaking reverie"). The narrative distance is stable, but the reliance on multi-syllabic jargon ("retrocognitively") disrupts the established mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by repetitive noun phrases ("hyperbolic geometry," "living bridges") and clunky, tell-heavy phrasings like "retrocognitively trapped." Some filter verbs and melodramatic word choices ("chewing them to bits") detract from the line-level density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of a designer trapped in his own creation is a classic trope, here executed with competence but little structural innovation. The synthesis of sci-fi elements (halo fragment) with gothic grief is effective but results in a standard "letting go" narrative.</comment>
