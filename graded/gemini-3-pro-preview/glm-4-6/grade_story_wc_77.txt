<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but agency is undermined by the protagonist constantly following the advisor's step-by-step instructions rather than making autonomous choices. Internal conflict is stated ("screamed to look away") rather than dramatized through hesitation or failed attempts before the final success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, instruction-based path ("The advisor urged... So I did"), which weakens causal tension. However, the closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where the curse is recontextualized as art, providing a distinct before/after state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The setting functions adequately as a metaphorical space but relies on standard "spooky carnival" tropes without unique sensory specificity. The distortion effects are described visually but lack tactile or visceral grounding beyond the initial description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalated through the confrontation with the death-image. The climax offers a legible turning point (embracing vs. fleeing), though the resolution feels slightly mechanical due to the advisor's prompting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Fear's weakness wasn't confrontation..."). The story relies on summarizing the lesson rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and maintains a coherent atmospheric tone. However, the dialogue serves almost exclusively as exposition or instruction, lacking naturalism or subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is functional but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("photographically cursed" appears four times) and clichéd descriptors ("dying star," "repulsive allure"). The integration of the prompt word "unbosom" feels awkward and forced within the sentence structure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core concept of "glitch horror" via resuscitation is interesting, but the funhouse execution feels derivative. The synthesis of elements is logical, yet the outcome follows a familiar "accept your shadow" trajectory.</comment>
