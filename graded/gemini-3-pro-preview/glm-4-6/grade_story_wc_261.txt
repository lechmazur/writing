<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Maya changes her entire worldview instantly upon hearing the plants, lacking genuine internal struggle or resistance. Her emotions are reported via physical clichés ("tears in her eyes") rather than embodied in the narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative flow is severely disrupted by non-diegetic text artifacts (code strings and foreign scripts) during the inciting incident. The resolution feels unearned, as the protagonist accepts a lecture from a fern without causal friction or complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The setting is functional, with the hourglass and plants serving as necessary props. However, the environment feels static and serves more as a container for symbols than a lived-in space that constrains the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no true opposition, as both the plants and her patient validate her new worldview immediately. The stakes are theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didacticism, with plants explicitly stating the moral ("You can't erase memory") in dialogue. Subtext is absent, replaced by direct authorial sermonizing through the characters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is shattered by the intrusion of code ("crisis_line_748") and untranslated text during the pivotal shift. These artifacts destroy the narrative distance and consistency required for a polished piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Severe text artifacts (code strings, Chinese, and Hindi characters) render the prose unpublishable. The writing also suffers from purple phrasing ("modern medicine's kiss," "meteor hush") that strains for poetic effect but lands on confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the premise of plant telepathy revealing medical ethics is novel, the execution relies on the clichéd "scars are stories" trope. The lack of distinct execution makes the synthesis feel like a prompt checklist rather than an organic story.</comment>
