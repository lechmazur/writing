<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct, and the shift from survivor to predator provides a compelling internal arc that complicates the protagonist's morality. However, much of the character's depth is delivered through expository reflection ("unfiltered awakening had come to him in fragments") rather than immediate reaction to scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is valid and effective, marking a decisive shift from passive simulation to active hunting with clear moral cost. The inciting power outage, however, resolves too easily without forcing a difficult choice, serving more as atmospheric delay than a causal trigger for the hunt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, effectively blending high-tech isolation with the metaphysical in a way that supports the premise. The "thermosphere" and "cooling blue glow" ground the scene well, though the description occasionally leans on abstract summaries of the equipment's function rather than sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The conceptual stakes are high, escalating from personal grief to a predatory harvest of others' tragedies, which implies a strong moral trade-off. The on-page conflict, however, remains largely internal and retrospective, lacking immediate external pressure until the final decision triggers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "potential energy" as a harvestable resource derived from grief is powerfully integrated and consistently developed. The geode metaphor resonates well with the concept of unused moments crystallizing, offering a bleak, non-literal answer to the protagonist's trauma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately analytical, fitting the "theologian of potential" persona. It occasionally slips into slightly purple phrasing ("haunting and beautiful," "wreckage of the man") that feels more like authorial intrusion than the character's lived experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear but marred by abstract telling ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy") and clichés ("familiar cocktail"). Phrases like "intangibly tangible" and "relay-sensitive hearts" feel overwrought, reducing the density and impact of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone warfare trauma with quantum mechanics and ghost-hunting is fresh and engaging. The concept of mapping "unlived lives" as an energy source offers a unique, dark twist on multiverse tropes that feels earned and specific.</comment>
