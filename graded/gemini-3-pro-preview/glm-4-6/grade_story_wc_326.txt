<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is a consistent focalizer, and his interaction with the ghost shows clear, albeit gentle, agency (tapping the shard to disrupt patterns). However, his internal landscape lacks contradictory impulses; his motivation is explicitly stated ("seeking wisdom") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires, resulting in a somewhat flat emotional trajectory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration (finding peace in the infinite). However, the causality is soft; the resolution relies on a dialogue-delivered epiphany rather than a hard-won narrative discovery. The plot functions largely as a vehicle for the thematic statement rather than a pressure cooker for character choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("opal facade," "curtains," "dark ink"), effectively establishing the "midnight solace" tone. The specific interaction with the ink on the star carvings grounds the sci-fi premise in tactile reality, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tension is low throughout; the rise in heart rate to "eighty-one" provides a micro-escalation, but there is no moment where the outcome feels genuinely in doubt or the cost of failure is imminent. The conflict is retrospective (processing the accident) and resolves smoothly without forcing a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily undermined by explicit moralizing. Both the dialogue ("wisdom not in success, but in what breaks us") and the final narrative paragraph summarize the lesson directly, violating the "show, don't tell" mandate of literary fiction. This didactic approach flattens the subtext significantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and slightly elevated register that suits the subject matter. The point of view remains securely with Elias. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into sermonizing, which feels slightly artificial for an intimate moment between survivors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally competent, but the opening sentence suffers from a jarring repetitive echo ("silent curtains... white silence"). The final paragraph acts as a summary/explanation of the story's meaning, which drags down the literary quality. There is also a tendency toward "template cadence" in the subject-verb sentence openers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise of a digital ghost and a survivor is a familiar trope, and the execution follows a standard "acceptance" arc without subverting expectations. While the ink divination adds a nice tactile layer, the emotional resolution feels safe and predictable rather than offering a fresh or distinctively risky insight.</comment>
