<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is passive, defined by labels ("shyly unstoppable") rather than choices made under pressure. Internal conflict is summarized ("hoarded for ages") rather than dramatized through specific, contradictory impulses or difficult decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Closure relies on external magic (the blossom simply dissolves pain) and a deus ex machina (a new postcard with instructions), bypassing character agency. Causality is absent; the protagonist waits for a destined event rather than earning a change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "gargantuan shell" is a vivid, surreal image that establishes a distinct atmosphere ("pearlescent walls"). However, the setting remains a static backdrop that provides no physical constraints or resources to force the character's hand.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative lacks active conflict or escalation; the stakes ("pain") are abstract and resolved without cost. The protagonist faces no obstacles, opposition, or necessary trade-offs to achieve the "armistice."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly preached via text artifacts ("pain bloom into constellations") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution—pain dissolving into light—is sentimental and avoids the complexity of the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical but marred by the unnatural insertion of prompt phrases ("ensconce," "gargantuan") that disrupt the rhythm. The elevated tone feels performative rather than rooted in character interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition of constraint phrases ("reef-shadow joy," "shyly unstoppable," "half-sung lullabies" each appear 3+ times) creates noticeable artifacts. Mixed metaphors ("photosynthesize pain") and purple prose reduce clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>A derivative allegory of art-as-healing that relies on standard tropes without subversion or specific, lived detail. The narrative feels constructed solely to house the checklist items rather than to explore a human truth.</comment>
