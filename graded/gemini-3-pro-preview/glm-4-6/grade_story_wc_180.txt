<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the character lacks internal contradiction or active struggle; emotion is summarized ("stubborn grin") rather than embodied in complex action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The scene is coherent and structurally complete, but lacks causal turns; it reads as a linear ritual without sufficient resistance to generate narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The surreal juxtaposition of orchard and cathedral is imaginative and visually distinct, though sensory descriptions occasionally lean into standard pairings ("dappled rivers").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stakes are purely internal and retrospective; the present action (planting) faces no active opposition or risk of failure, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" is a strong concept, but it is explicitly defined for the reader rather than emerging organically from the narrative subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental; the reliance on explanation ("a reminder of," "a testament to") distances the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Adjective-noun pairings are dense and often cliché ("tattered ribbon," "rough-hewn wood," "leafy sea"), creating a "painted" effect that slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The central image of the cathedral orchard is creative and memorable, though the "mending a broken family through ritual" arc is familiar.</comment>
