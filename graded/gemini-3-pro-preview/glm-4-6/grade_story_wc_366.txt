<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is consistent but defined largely by summary ("man of few words") and explicit labeling of traits ("warmly observant nature"). Internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices; emotions are described ("pang of longing") rather than enacted through behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end, moving from isolation to connection. However, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned; the stakes are low, and the "soft" plot lacks a decisive turning point or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is established but relies heavily on "literary" clichés ("mist-kissed waves," "tides and time") and generic imagery. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of concrete, physical friction or specific sensory detail beyond the visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant external opposition or internal hesitation in executing his task. The "ghosts" provide atmosphere but do not complicate the action, resulting in a flat escalation curve lacking genuine tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Subtext is undermined by the final paragraph, which explicitly explains the theme ("safety wasn’t just about physical light..."). This didactic summation flattens the narrative resonance and violates the show-don't-tell principle expected in literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but leans toward a purple, over-written register ("clamor of human interaction"). Narrative distance is maintained, but the filter verbs ("he knew," "caught his eye") distance the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by stock adjective-noun pairings ("weathered tiller," "lone tower") and alliterative clichés ("tides and time"). The rhythm is lulling but lacks freshness or the sharp, specific imagery required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise of a lonely lighthouse keeper finding connection through anonymous notes is a familiar trope. The execution plays it straight without subverting expectations or offering a unique, specific angle on the material.</comment>
