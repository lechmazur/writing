<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is a functional protagonist, but his motivation is largely summarized ("obsession," "personal quest") rather than dramatized through friction. The transition to "avenger" at the end relies on a label rather than earned emotional complexity, and he makes a massive knowledge leap regarding the song's physics that violates established character limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The investigation proceeds via summary until the climax, which relies on an "explain-everything" realization: Elias instantly understands a song is a physics key for infinite energy. This unearned leap resolves the plot mechanically without prior setup, breaking causal validity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The setting is a functional, if standard, cyberpunk archive; the "pocket dimension" within an algorithm is a creative specific. However, the environment rarely constrains the protagonist's choices, serving mostly as a container for clues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes telescope wildly in the final paragraph (from missing ship to global energy revolution) without being tested in the scene. The protagonist faces passive opposition and pays no visible or felt cost for his actions; the resolution is a simple button-press.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The ending explicitly states the moral ("they had deleted a revolution to protect an empire"), collapsing subtext into a summary lecture. The theme is asserted rather than emerging organically from the conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV is consistent third-person limited, but narrative distance slips at the end to deliver expository information about the song's function. The voice is competent but leans on slightly elevated, generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on stock phrases and clichés ("ghost in the machine," "breadcrumb trail," "Rosetta Stone," "jagged scar"). The narrative mode is predominantly summary/telling, which reduces immediacy and impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative assembles familiar tropes (corporate erasure, hidden energy source, music as code) without a fresh synthesis. The Daedalus/Icarus allusion is standard, and the execution follows a predictable template.</comment>
