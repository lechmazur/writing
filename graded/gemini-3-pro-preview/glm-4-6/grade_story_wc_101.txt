<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a fable archetype rather than a realized individual; interiority is summarized as general intent ("understood that survival depended") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or specific micro-choices in a scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The narrative reads as a synopsis or summary of months rather than a dramatized story; it lacks a specific scene anchor (Who, Where, When) and relies on "and then" sequencing without a distinct, on-page climax or causal turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting details like the "terra-cotta arbor" are distinct but remain static backdrops; the summary mode prevents the environment from exerting concrete pressure on tactical choices or constraining action in real-time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("survival") but remain abstract due to the lack of an immediate, high-pressure test; conflict is diffused over time rather than escalated through a specific confrontation or difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("it was the anonymous nature... that had made the greatest difference"), violating the subtext rule and reducing the story to a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, suffering from "helpful narrator syndrome" where the meaning of symbols and actions is interpreted for the reader rather than shown through perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean but relies on abstract telling ("practiced economy," "renewed sense of worth") and standard phrasing ("hollowed out," "move like a shadow") rather than concrete sensory imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>A familiar "community resilience" trope executed as a standard fable; the predictable structure and lack of specific, idiosyncratic human behavior limit its ingenuity.</comment>
