<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arthur’s interiority is vivid and consistent, establishing a clear psychological baseline. However, his pivotal realization (“Understanding” capitalized) feels more like an intellectual adjustment observed from the sidelines rather than a visceral reaction earned through active struggle or high-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, utilizing an accumulative structure that effectively builds to the discovery of the parasol tip. While the closure is legible as a Conceptual Repricing, the climax relies on a passive observation of others (the singing woman) rather than a decisive action by the protagonist, lowering the felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specific, with strong sensory details like the "clean scent of melting bergs" and the "slushy mire" grounding the abstract theme. The environment successfully pressures the protagonist’s worldview, though the "salt, sorrow" descriptor blends abstract and concrete in a slightly disjointed way.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high conceptually (sanity/reality) but the on-page pressure is low; Arthur operates largely as an invisible observer. The escalation is internal and meditative, lacking a moment of sharp external friction or a forced trade-off that would drive the score higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The central theme of endurance vs. finality is poignant, but the ending succumbs to a "Thematic Echo" penalty by explicitly explaining the thesis ("The sound... was the sound of what continues"). This didactic summary flattens the resonance that the imagery had successfully built.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and suitably contemplative, matching the protagonist’s intellectual detachment. The capitalization of abstract concepts ("Understanding") feels slightly affected, but the overall distance and tone remain stable and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good rhythmic variance. However, distinct clichés like reality slipping "like sand" and the capitalization of abstract nouns detract from the freshness. The density is good, though the final paragraph leans heavily on explanation rather than image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "euthanasia tourist" pivoting to disaster relief to study endings is a fresh and compelling hook. The execution follows a more traditional "epiphany via observation of resilient locals" path, which feels familiar despite the unique setup.</comment>
