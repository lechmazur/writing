<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is a diagnostic label that replaces characterization; Kael lacks internal conflict or flaws, acting as a passive vessel for resolution without a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Causality is linear and low-stakes; the resolution ("standing as a kindness") is a soft reset with no visible cost or trade-off, violating the closure requirement for high bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "frozen amber tear" are vivid, but the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for the anomaly rather than pressuring choices or restricting movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Escalation is minimal; the anomaly's perceived hostility is quickly dismissed as "desperation," removing the need for a difficult decision, sacrifice, or genuine peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("He understood now that...") rather than emerging organically; the ending explains the subtext directly to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice relies on abstract summaries of internal states ("spirit was phototropic") rather than dramatized experience; the tone is consistent but overly explanatory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose leans toward the purple ("sharp gentleness," "nutrient to his spirit") with metaphors that obscure immediate physical action; "sharp gentleness" appears as a repetitive bookend.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise of an artisan healing a magical anomaly through pure empathy is a familiar trope; the execution offers no subversive twist or fresh, specific complication.</comment>
