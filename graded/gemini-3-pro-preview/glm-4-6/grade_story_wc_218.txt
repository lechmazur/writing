<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies on summary labels ("peculiar kind of peace," "brazen calm") rather than embodied reactions to the diagnosis in a specific moment. The rapid movement through time prevents the display of internal contradiction or difficult micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story violates the single-scene scope default, relying on a montage that spans months ("Three months into his sentence," "In his final days") rather than a dramatized scene. This summary mode flattens causality and prevents a distinct closure unit with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The setting details (copper wire, shifting stone patterns) are evocative but remain general backdrop due to the summary nature of the narrative. The environment does not actively constrain immediate choices or generate tactile friction in a specific beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist executes a plan against a passive timeline without active opposition or a "tightening" moment that forces a trade-off. The stakes are high (mortality), but the lack of struggle or error renders the outcome inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Themes are explicitly stated ("foster interspecies respect," "stone could be alive") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The resolution offers a tidy moral summary rather than a resonant, ambiguous aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but distant, favoring "telling" over "showing" (e.g., "Kaelen’s motivation had crystallized"). This distance keeps the reader from experiencing the character's physical or emotional decay viscerally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable but relies on familiar similes ("fray like old rope") and abstract assertions ("memory, or intention") instead of concrete density. The heavy use of summary drains momentum from potential high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of wiring trees to stone is imaginative, but the execution feels like a standard fable or prompt response rather than a fresh literary synthesis. The emotional arc is predictable and lacks a sharp, specific insight.</comment>
