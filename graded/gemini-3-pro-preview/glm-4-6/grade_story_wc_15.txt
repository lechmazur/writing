<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is a functional protagonist with clear motivation, but she encounters no meaningful internal or external resistance. Her journey is one of smooth intuition rather than struggle, lacking the "visible cost" required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative flows via dream logic, which excuses the spatial shifts, but the climax relies on an unearned magical ability ("sewing air") introduced only at the moment of resolution. Closure is achieved but lacks causal weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the image of canyon walls glowing "like internal organs" is striking. The environment effectively frames the surreal nature of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure that forces a difficult choice. The resolution is an act of creation that meets no resistance, resulting in low narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in ruin is coherent, but the conclusion explicitly states the moral ("not a loss but an invitation") rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The poetic voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone. Narrative distance is well-controlled, though it leans towards observation over deep interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The word "impossible" appears five times, creating a repetitive lexical loop that dilutes the impact of the imagery. The prose is otherwise polished but relies on these crutch words to convey wonder.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dried ocean and a canyon labyrinth is imaginative. However, the "magical healing" arc is a safe choice that avoids riskier narrative complications.</comment>
