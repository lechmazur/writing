<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the protagonist faces no interpersonal resistance; the ghost yields immediately upon contact, removing the potential for a "relationship as crucible." The dialogue relies on stock phrases ("You were just a girl") that resolve a century of estrangement without earning the emotional shift through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path (setup, execution, success) with no complications or setbacks to test the protagonist's resolve. While the closure is legible, the lack of causal friction makes the resolution feel automatic rather than earned by the specific actions taken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific details like the "dissonant chorus" and "fine dust" grounding the supernatural interaction. The looming demolition effectively creates atmospheric pressure and frames the scene in a specific moment of time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Escalation is virtually absent; the "stubborn" ghost offers no resistance to the device, and the stakes—while high in backstory—face no active threat in the scene. The conflict is resolved instantly by the technology, bypassing the opportunity for a meaningful deepening of the dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("imperfect miracles that didn't erase the past") rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action. The story relies on telling the reader what the moment means instead of allowing the subtext to carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is competent but disconnected from the "gossip-column" persona promised in the exposition; the tone remains earnest and somewhat melodramatic throughout. The narration lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish this exorcist from a generic technician.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is functional but marred by purple phrasing like "a mix of gravel and starlight" that calls attention to itself without adding clarity. Rhythmic control is adequate, though the pacing feels static due to the lack of tension in the central exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the "techno-exorcism" method offers a slight twist, the core emotional arc—a failed protector finding peace through a simple apology—is a standard trope executed without subversion. The story plays it safe, adhering to familiar ghost story conventions without transforming them.</comment>
