<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("somatic markers," "integrating") which distances the reader from embodied emotion. The character follows a linear, therapeutic progression without the internal contradictions or difficult choices that create depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary and loose temporal jumps ("One morning," "Later that afternoon") rather than a continuous high-pressure scene. The central epiphany ("transcendent freeze") arrives conveniently to resolve the conflict without earned causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cliffside arboretum is vivid and serves as an effective objective correlative for the protagonist's internal state. Specific botanical details like sea thrift and sempervivum ground the setting, though the pathetic fallacy is somewhat standard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain internal and abstract; the conflict is resolved by a sudden, unforced realization rather than a decision made under pressure. The protagonist faces no active opposition, and the resolution lacks a felt price on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated ("anchor optimism in realism") rather than allowed to emerge from subtext. The lighthouse keeper functions as a mouthpiece to deliver the story's moral directly to the reader, flattening the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice is generally consistent but is disrupted by the awkward insertion of technical jargon ("somatic markers") and repeated prompt phrases. The tone leans into sentimental reflection, reducing the immediacy of the grief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prompt phrases ("quietly talented hands," "somatic markers," "anchor optimism") are repeated verbatim, creating a checklist effect that mars the prose rhythm. The writing is functional but relies on telling and filter verbs rather than active density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the premise of a gardening survivor is clear, the execution follows a predictable trauma-recovery arc without subverting expectations. The "drone strike" background feels utilized more for aesthetic mood than for generating specific, fresh narrative complications.</comment>
