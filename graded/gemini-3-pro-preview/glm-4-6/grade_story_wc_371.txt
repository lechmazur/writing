<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is defined primarily by diagnostic labels ("creeping normality noticer") rather than distinct, embodied traits under pressure. Her internal landscape is summarized through abstract concepts ("sought to find the sacred") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses, resulting in a character who feels more like a thematic vessel than a living agent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the shared bread re-anchors the protagonist's worldview. However, the resolution relies heavily on the convenient coincidence of the baker waiting in the hedge, which lowers the sense of earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere of "ruined beauty" is consistent and sensory ("damp earth," "phantom sweetness"), effectively grounding the fable. However, the setting details remain largely ornamental; the "secret tea house" provides a backdrop but does not strictly constrain Elara's tactical choices or enforce a physical cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes are low and primarily atmospheric; the central conflict is a passive chase for a "ghost" scent rather than an active struggle against opposition. The resolution comes through a gentle meeting rather than a pressure-tested choice, and the "cost" (sharing the bread) feels symbolic rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing to deliver its theme, culminating in a sermonizing ending ("The ordinary glowed now, sacred and whole") that flattens subtext. The concept of "tenuous absolution" is stated directly rather than emerging organically from the narrative friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice aims for a lyrical tone but is disrupted by jarring register shifts and prompt-forced phrasing like "heuristically gentle habit." These insertions break the established mood, making the construction visible and distancing the reader from the protagonist's perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally competent, but the text suffers from "prompt-itis," inserting required terms as awkward modifiers ("through guerrilla gardening," "creeping normality noticer") that clash with the fable-like register. Figuration occasionally drifts into purple prose ("delicate weight of a miracle") that obscures rather than clarifies the moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece executes a standard "cozy post-apocalyptic" vignette with familiar tropes of seed-planting and memory-keeping. While the twist that the bakery didn't vanish but simply "stopped" is a nice conceptual pivot, the overall execution feels derivative of common genre templates.</comment>
