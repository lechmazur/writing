<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; his motivation ("discover the texture of memories") is abstract and lacks embodied urgency. Internal conflict is absent, replaced by diagnostic assertions of feeling ("insatiable need") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary and backstory (~50%) before engaging the specific scene, which dilutes immediate pressure. The closure ("Earned Stasis") validates the protagonist's method but lacks a visible, felt cost or a decisive shift in options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Descriptions are atmospheric but rely on standard genre shorthand ("steel canyons," "monoliths") rather than idiosyncratic detail. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources that forces specific tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("armor against the nameless void") but remain theoretical, facing no concrete external test or rising pressure on the page. The conflict is entirely internal and abstract, lacking a tightening of the screw that forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Subtext is collapsed into explicit assertion, most notably when the text explains its own symbolism ("a potent metaphor for his own administrative death"). The theme is delivered through narration rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but distant, utilizing an elevated, somewhat academic register ("narrative transmutation") that filters the immediacy of the experience. The tone feels slightly impersonal, prioritizing poetic concept over character-specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("mosaic of forgotten moments") and "tell" constructions that summarize emotional states. Heavy use of Latinate diction ("monolith," "testimonial," "transmutation") creates a purple texture that dulls narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "ghost" erased by bureaucracy living in the margins is a familiar trope executed here without a fresh subversive angle or specific lived detail. The resolution—finding meaning in a discarded object—follows a predictable literary template.</comment>
