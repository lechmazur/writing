<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Characterization relies on trait labels ("sharply observant nature") rather than dramatized behavior under pressure. The protagonist's internal shift is intellectual and summarized, lacking embodied emotion or the friction of a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The narrative breaks the short-story scope with a tension-killing "two weeks" summary and relies on the convenient discovery of "shredded letters" to explain the plot. The climax consists of reading exposition rather than active engagement or causal consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The visual contrast of the lush, radioactive orchard against the wasteland is vivid and effectively anchors the premise. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of immediate physical constraint or pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Escalation is virtually absent; there is no antagonist or active opposition to force a narrowing of options. The investigation proceeds linearly without risk, and the resolution comes without any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story ends with explicit moralizing ("precisely what humanity had lost") that flattens subtext into a lecture. The theme is stated rather than emerging organically from the conflict, triggering the "Thematic Echo" penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs and explanatory narration ("Maya adjusted," "Maya removed," "Maya finally comprehended"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often telling the reader what to think about the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from summary at pivotal moments ("began the meticulous process") and telling ("intuit what had really happened"). These shortcuts rob the narrative of density and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "corporate conspiracy revealed by shredded documents" trope is familiar and executed without a fresh twist. The central insight about imperfection feels safe and predictable rather than earning its weight through specific novelty.</comment>
