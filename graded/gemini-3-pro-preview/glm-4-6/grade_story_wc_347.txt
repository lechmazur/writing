<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tomas is a compelling, burdened figure with clear competence and motivation. The mention of "morning sickness" is disorienting—unclear if a literal biological cost or a clumsy metaphor—and momentarily confuses the character's physical reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight; the blueprint, nut, and assembly lead directly to the resolution under pressure. Closure lands with a resonant image of entrapment ("frost kisses"), effectively fulfilling the structural requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard is atmospheric and claustrophobic, and the mechanical birds provide a specific, urgent threat. A clear text generation artifact ("晶体者") disrupts the description of the frost line, breaking immersion in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and lethal, with the descending frost line creating effective ticking-clock pressure. The tension between the delicate assembly work and the encroaching mechanical sentinels drives the scene well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "graceless beauty" and duty weaves well into the action. The final realization that the orchard "takes more than it gives" anchors the narrative, though the explicit statement feels slightly on the nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally distinct and atmospheric, fitting the dark fantasy tone. However, the presence of foreign character artifacts severely undermines the polished, authoritative control required for higher scoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant text artifacts (Chinese characters "清晰的" and "晶体者") appear twice, rendering the text unpublishable in a literary context. These glitches, combined with the confusing "morning sickness" phrasing, constitute a major line-level failure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The combination of mechanical birds, a cursed orchard, and a magical blueprint creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The method of "leaving impressions on the air" is an inventive, magical-realist touch that elevates the resolution.</comment>
