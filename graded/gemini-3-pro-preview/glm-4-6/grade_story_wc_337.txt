<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias’s internal arc resolves through a legible conceptual repricing, but the realization feels more thematic than earned by deep on-page struggle. Anna functions solely as an exposition delivery device rather than a fully realized character, and Elias's emotions are often told via labels ("lucid unrest") rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative progression is functional and linear, but the central secret is revealed through dialogue rather than excavated through dramatic action. The repetition of the grammatically awkward phrase "Across sharing the secret" creates a mechanical seam that disrupts the causal flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is a vivid, integrated setting that actively shapes the resolution by providing the light necessary to ground the spirits. The environment operates as a constraint and tool, fulfilling the requirement for high-band setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is present as the knots evolve, but the opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than active. The climax relies on a sudden intellectual realization rather than a difficult trade-off or a visibly paid cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme of grief and connection is coherent, but the ending resorts to explicit moralizing ("grief, when properly honored...") that flattens the subtext into a lecture. The resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than evoked through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally drifts into overwrought description ("interlaced hush upon hush"). The tone matches the magical realism elements but lacks rhythmic variety, creating a static effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mandatory phrase "Across sharing the secret" is inserted with awkward syntax that breaks the prose rhythm twice, reading as a forced constraint. Abstract nouns are treated too concretely ("accumulated silence") without sufficient grounding in sensory detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration with a supernatural fisherman's net is a fresh angle on the trapped-spirit trope. However, the execution follows a standard procedural path without significant structural risk or non-obvious emotional turns.</comment>
