<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a collective protagonist ("the settlers," "the community") rather than a focal character with specific interiority or contradictory impulses. Elara and Kael appear as named functions rather than fully realized individuals, and no character faces a micro-choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story operates as a synopsis or chronicle spanning years ("For months following," "In the seasons that followed") rather than a dramatized scene. The lack of a specific, grounded timeline prevents the formation of genuine narrative pressure or a closure unit where cost is paid in the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the concepts (floating arches, bioluminescent butterflies) are visual, they are presented as static "postcard" descriptions rather than environmental constraints that shape immediate action. The setting is observed from a distance rather than navigated through a specific POV's sensory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is resolved through summary montage ("orchestrating a collective effort") rather than a dramatized crisis. The transition from survival to stewardship happens without a felt price or a high-stakes decision point on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("the greatest homecoming happens not when..."), which acts as a sermon rather than earned resonance. This didactic approach flattens the subtext and resolves ambiguity with a tidy lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like register ("It was seventeen-year-old Kael who...") that precludes emotional immediacy. The omniscient summary style creates a barrier to engagement, keeping the reader at arm's length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose is mechanically functional but relies heavily on "telling" and time-compression scaffolding ("who would later be known," "They noticed patterns"). There is a lack of concrete action verbs and specific sensory details in favor of generalized reporting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise of a benevolent planetary spirit/AI guiding colonists to harmony is a familiar sci-fi trope executed here without a subversive twist or fresh character focus. The execution follows a standard "discovery to utopia" trajectory without complication.</comment>
