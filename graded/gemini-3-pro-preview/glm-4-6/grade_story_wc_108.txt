<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by diagnostic labels ("adaptive," "phobia") rather than specific, embodied behavior; the "stunt double" profession does not shape his tactics or worldview. Emotional transitions are summarized ("cracked that resolve," "hope ignited") rather than dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The narrative reads like a synopsis of a longer work, relying on a jarring, unmotivated spatial jump from the library to a laboratory and back. Causality is weak; the resolution depends on magical notes that instantly reverse a betrayal without logical mechanism or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The setting is rendered through heavy-handed metaphors ("skeletons," "glittering like scattered salt") that prioritize atmosphere over spatial coherence. The "iron doors" initially lock the protagonist in but cease to be a constraint when the plot requires travel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Conflict is deflated by the protagonist's instant competence; he decrypts the puzzle immediately and the antagonist collapses at the first confrontation. There is no escalation of pressure, no back-and-forth struggle, and no visible cost to the victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The theme is stated explicitly in dialogue and text ("Vulnerability is power") rather than emerging from subtext or choice. The ending relies on moralizing assertions ("betrayal transformed into... a lesson") instead of resonant imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The voice suffers from melodramatic over-explanation ("shattered his identity," "desperate to mend") and cliché dialogue ("You're too late"). The narrative distance is distant and summary-heavy, preventing immersion in the immediate moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Prose is weighed down by purple modifiers and "tell-y" realizations ("realized with a jolt," "adaptive nature asserting itself"). Sentence structure is repetitive, often relying on "He [verb], his [noun] [verbing]" constructions that create a monotone rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story forces disparate elements together without organic synthesis; the stunt double concept is nominal, and the resolution relies on standard tropes of finding instructions to defeat a villain. The execution lacks a fresh angle or specific, lived detail.</comment>
