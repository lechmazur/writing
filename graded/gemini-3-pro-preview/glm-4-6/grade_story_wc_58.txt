<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist acts as a passive observer rather than a character under pressure; his internal state is summarized ("lonesome splendor") rather than dramatized through friction. He faces no contradictory impulses or difficult choices on the page, resulting in a static portrait rather than a dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative is a vignette with no causal drive or meaningful escalation; the protagonist simply sits and writes without obstacle. The ending is procedural (finishing a task) and lacks a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with any visible or felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "garden of explained absences" with its copper signs is a specific, memorable setting that effectively grounds the theme. Atmospheric details (skeletal trees, remaining leaves) are vivid and establish a clear, consistent mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the isolation is described as "splendor" rather than a pressure that forces a trade-off. There is no meaningful tightening of options, and the protagonist enters and leaves the scene with the same stance and resources.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing ("healing wasn't about erasure, but integration") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story dictates the takeaway to the reader, preventing organic depth or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it relies heavily on filter verbs ("watched," "wondered," "found himself admiring") that distance the reader. The reflective tone suits the content but often substitutes summary for immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from abstraction ("essence of lives," "geography of healing") that reduces concrete impact. The simile at the climax ("words wove together like the carpet thread") feels slightly convenient and ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core concept of "obituaries for the living" coupled with the "garden of explained absences" is imaginative and fresh. However, the execution plays it safe, using these elements for a quiet reflection rather than a narrative that tests their implications.</comment>
