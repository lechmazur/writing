<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is tightly focused through the attribute of being "functionally creative," which acts as both a compulsion and a lens for the narrative. The internal conflict—between the cynical knowledge that proposals die and the creative urge to fix broken systems—is dramatized effectively in the sketching scene. Maren's interiority is specific and professional, grounding the emotional arc in her engineering background.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal/Accumulative hybrid path, moving from observation to a pivotal interaction with the sextant, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration of the space. The closure—saving the file despite knowing the likely bureaucratic failure—lands with the weight of earned resistance against entropy. The transition from physical survey to imaginative reconstruction is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with exceptional specificity and thematic weight; the "gutted cathedral of transit" and the "reef absorbs shipwrecks" metaphor create a vivid, layered history. The physical details (confetti in grout, cold lights, geothermal vents) actively constrain and inspire the protagonist's choices. The environment functions as an antagonist and a muse, fully integrated into the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and internal, pitting the protagonist's constructive nature against the "atmospheric pressure" of abandonment and likely futility. While the external stakes are low (an intern's drawing), the conceptual stakes—memory vs. oblivion—are raised effectively through the sextant discovery. The "cost" is the emotional labor invested in a doomed project, which is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of repurposing failure into assets is powerfully developed through the "maze of intentions" motif. The sextant serves as a potent, non-obvious symbol for navigation in a void. A slight deduction for the paragraph beginning "To resurrect a place," which borders on an explicit thesis statement rather than letting the action speak entirely for itself, but the final image re-anchors resonance beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, precise, and appropriately textured with engineering sensibility ("load-bearing walls," "junction boxes") blended with lyrical observation. The POV remains tightly anchored in Maren's perception, filtering the world through her specific professional bias. The tone balances the melancholy of the setting with the pragmatism of the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold; images like "absorbed them all into its bones like a reef absorbs shipwrecks" are memorable and linguistically precise. Information density is high, with sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and characterization. The pacing slows appropriately for the sextant examination and accelerates during the sketching phase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a derelict spaceport with community hydroponics via existing utility flows feels fresh and specifically grounded in the story's reality. The concept of architecture as a "maze of intentions" offers a unique lens on the common trope of abandoned buildings. The story avoids the cliché of simple nostalgia, opting for a constructive, if likely futile, intervention.</comment>
