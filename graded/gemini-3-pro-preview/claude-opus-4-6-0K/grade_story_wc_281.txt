<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s internal state is rendered with high specificity, grounding the sci-fi premise in tangible somatic experience. The shift from panic to artistic curiosity drives the narrative arc effectively, though Jonah remains a slightly functional figure whose "skepticism" melts away conveniently fast to validate the ending. The somatic focus anchors her motivation perfectly in the physical reality of the story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, moving logically from the inciting withdrawal to the creative experiment and final realization. The closure acts as a strong Conceptual Repricing, reframing the "damage" of withdrawal as a functional map. A slight lack of friction during the "devising" phase—the experiment works perfectly on the first try—keeps this from the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The studio setting and the muscovite geode are not merely backdrop but active constraints that shape the final image and the protagonist's realization. The sensory details of ozone, lavender, and the geode's mica layers effectively bridge the gap between the clinical backstory and the artistic present. The environment directly enables the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the internal pressure of the "static shock" is palpable, the narrative lacks a significant obstacle once Maren decides to act. The transition from suffering to mastery happens in a single, successful beat without a moment of failure or trade-off to heighten the stakes. The conflict is resolved through immediate success rather than struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the geode mirroring the body's nervous system is resonant and well-developed through imagery. However, the score is impacted by a Thematic Echo in the final dialogue ("I think the withdrawal isn't damage... I think it's a map"), which explicitly states the subtext rather than letting the powerful final image speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending clinical observation with artistic sensitivity ("perceptual country," "emotional weather"). The tone manages the shift from medical anxiety to wondrous discovery without breaking character. It feels authoritative and distinct to Maren’s perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory anchoring. A few descriptions lean toward the overwrought ("frozen lightning branching into infinity"), and the integration of the "willow glass" simile feels slightly ornamental. Overall, the line-level craft supports the story's ethereal yet scientific tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of light painting, geology, and pharmaceutical withdrawal offers a genuinely fresh premise. The "somatic markers" as a tool for art rather than just a symptom is a clever inversion of the standard "drug gone wrong" trope. The execution feels specific and novel.</comment>
