<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal discipline is actively dramatized; her choice to hold still against the encroaching vine turns a passive observational role into high-stakes agency. The conflict between the temptation to interpret and the duty to record is felt in the body and the "old temptation," grounding the philosophical stance in character struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively as Earned Stasis; the threat to the swan challenges and ultimately validates her philosophy of non-interference. The narrative arc from observation to crisis (the vine touching the record) to resolution is distinct and causally tight under an Accumulative/Situational lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "patience of roots" and "soft as cloth" create a distinct, immersive texture that anchors the metaphysical stakes. The environment is not just a backdrop but the primary antagonist and subject, rendered with exceptional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The vine functions as a coherent pressure mechanism; the tension between the urge to save the record and the duty to witness is palpable. While the vine's withdrawal offers a slight reprieve, the protagonist's willingness to risk the swan demonstrates the necessary cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of acceptance is resonant, though the internal monologue occasionally drifts into explicit thesis statements ("Destruction was just change wearing unfamiliar clothes"). Despite this slight over-articulation, the final image of the breath settling into the library's memory carries the concept beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and perfectly tuned to the protagonist’s meditative state; the perceptual signature is unique and sustained. The prose rhythm mimics the "regenerative silence" central to the story's concept.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high density and propulsion; metaphors like "knowledge composting" are fresh and organically integrated. The lyricism supports the pacing without slowing the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of the "last librarian" trope with the specific mechanics of the origami notation and the philosophy of regenerative silence. The concept of "witnessing without judgment" is executed with a rigorous, non-obvious emotional logic.</comment>
