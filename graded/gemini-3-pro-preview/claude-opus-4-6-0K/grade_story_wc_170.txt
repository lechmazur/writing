<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by her function and cost rather than active choices in a specific moment. The iterative mode ("she would") distances the reader from her interiority, preventing the realization of a specific, high-pressure beat where character traits are tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The piece functions as a portrait or vignette using iterative summary rather than a dramatized scene with a specific timeline. While the closure lands a valid conceptual repricing (the trade-off), the lack of a specific "now" limits structural tension and causal drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details regarding light, sound, and stone are vivid and precise ("caught light like a row of prisms"), effectively grounding the magical elements. The atmosphere is cohesive and supports the fable-like tone without becoming generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pressure is static rather than escalating; the cost ("borrowed heartbeat") is a stated rule rather than a rising threat faced in a specific crisis. The conflict remains conceptual, lacking a decisive on-page turning point or escalation of stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of sacrificial grace is resonant and well-integrated with the magic system. The ending elegantly synthesizes the central stakes ("One borrowed heartbeat less. One possibility more") without resorting to moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The collective, mythic voice ("Nobody in the hill town...") is consistent and polished, perfectly suiting the atmospheric intent. It maintains a controlled distance that enhances the legend quality while keeping the narrative distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic, dense, and polished, with excellent sentence-level propulsion ("shift, obey, rearrange"). The writing avoids artifacts and uses concrete imagery to effectively convey abstract magical concepts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synesthetic magic system—using coded lullabies to bend light in rain—is highly imaginative and fresh. The specific mechanism of "persuading" mirrors to show possibilities adds a unique and memorable layer to the premise.</comment>
