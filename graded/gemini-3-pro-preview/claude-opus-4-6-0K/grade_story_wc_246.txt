<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's internal voice is distinct and the concept of "authorship vs. translation" aligns well with her role. However, her acceptance of the power to edit reality lacks dramatized emotional resistance or struggle; the reliance on summary prevents seeing her make difficult choices under immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on retrospective summary ("She discovered," "That was when") rather than a dramatized scene. While the closure (Charged Poise) is legible, the structure reads more like a synopsis of several months than a singular, pressure-filled event, violating the default scope for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting of the Locus is vividly rendered with specific sensory details like "spacetime pooled like water" and the "hum" of the nib. The atmosphere of isolation effectively supports the thematic weight of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The stakes are theoretically high (causality, lives saved), but they feel low in the reading experience because the major crisis is resolved in backstory. The final beat with the Vela signal lacks established immediate danger or time pressure on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of rewriting vs. understanding is excellent and organically integrated into the mechanics of the story. The ending resonates strongly with this concept, offering a clear conceptual repricing of the protagonist's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent, maintaining a tone of "confident uncertainty" that fits the protagonist. The distance is slightly too remote due to the summary mode, but the control is evident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and imagery ("harmonic ghosts," "unbent her own spine"). The line-level craft elevates the expository sections, though a few filter verbs slightly distance the reader.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a signal interpreter with a reality-editing pen at a gravitational anomaly is fresh and engaging. The metaphor of editing text applied to spacetime is handled with ingenuity.</comment>
