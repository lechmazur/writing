<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira is a distinct, empathetic vessel whose internal silence mirrors the ghost's need perfectly. While the emotional logic is sound, the stakes feel somewhat cyclical ("She always returned") rather than forcing a singular, high-cost choice in this specific instance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A clean, linear structure that effectively builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shared silence). The pacing aligns beautifully with the lightning/thunder interval, using the environmental constraint to shape the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the mechanism of the story; the courtyard, the "shifting graffiti," and the weather actively participate in the decoding. The environment constrains the action (the lightning interval) and enables the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The pressure is atmospheric and poignant, but the immediate risk is low; the protagonist performs a ritual she has mastered rather than facing a new, desperate test. The cost is emotional labor rather than a sacrificed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of translating loneliness into art is resonant, but the ending leans into explanation ("found the grammar for what neither could say alone") rather than trusting the powerful image of the "full silence" to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident and cohesive, successfully blending folklore rhythms with sci-fi concepts ("binary veins," "heart drawn in hexadecimal"). The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping us close to Lira's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Polished, lyrical prose with high density and strong rhythm. Images like "forgotten balcony of heaven" and "code can weep" work well within the established fable-like tone without becoming overly purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a traditional bardic figure with a digital/cyberpunk "ghost in the machine"—mediated by an analog flower press—is a fresh, specific conceit that elevates the premise above standard tropes.</comment>
