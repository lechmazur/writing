<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maret is portrayed with competence and distinct physicality ("stained with silver nitrate"), but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene. Her actions are predetermined and executed without hesitation or meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The characterization relies on static endurance rather than active struggle or a dilemma that reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear procedural structure (preparation → execution → success) without a decisive turn or complication. While the closure (reading the map) is causally linked to the ritual, it lacks a legible "felt cost" or trade-off; Maret gets exactly what she sought without paying a price on the page. The ending reads as symmetric satisfaction rather than a resonant reconfiguration of her status.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and integral to the logic of the story; the crater's mineral composition and the pooling starlight create a unique constraint space. Sensory details are sharp ("pins pressed through velvet," "blackened by frost"). The score is capped at 8.7 due to the Q2 gate, but the atmospheric specificity is the story's strongest asset.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretical rather than immediate; there is no opposition, risk of failure, or rising pressure on the page. The narrative functions as a successful experiment rather than a drama; the "waiting" is described but not felt as an agonizing tightening of options. Without an obstacle or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the escalation remains flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "preserving things on surfaces designed to vanish" is woven beautifully into the mechanics of the alchemy. The concept of mapping invisible rhythms and "safekept starlight" resonates well with the action. The ending offers a poetic expansion of the premise (a geography of longing) that feels earned by the imagery, even if the plot stakes are low.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical distance that matches the protagonist's patience. The focus remains tightly on Maret's perception without head-hopping. The tone supports the "moving stillness" requirement effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and dense, but relies on a repetitive simile template ("held... the way a cupped palm holds," "patience the way stone demonstrates," "built... the way frost builds"). These distinct echoes within a short space create a rhythmic artifact that draws attention to the scaffolding rather than the image. Otherwise, the line-level craft is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The core concept of flash-paper alchemy powered by pooled starlight is imaginative and fresh. However, the execution plays it safe with a standard ritual-success arc. The originality lies in the magic system and setting rather than a surprising narrative trajectory or emotional insight.</comment>
