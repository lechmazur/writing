<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is incisive and distinct, balancing the external "ghost" persona with a vulnerable, well-dramatized internal conflict ("professionalism, not pathology"). The final surrender is earned by the specific weight of the moon rock and the letter, representing a credible breach of her defenses. The progression from "desperately jocular" deflection to the quiet acceptance of the dinner invitation demonstrates a profound shift with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight and efficient, with a clear inciting incident (Petra’s arrival) leading to a decisive closure unit (stepping off the platform). While the "rumor chain" paragraph is a slight expository bridge, it efficiently establishes causality without stalling momentum. The closure lands as a Decisive Change that effectively reconfigures the protagonist's status from elusive to engaged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting of the "Platform Nowhere" is exceptional, functioning as both an atmospheric backdrop and a thematic mirror for Maren’s isolation. The imagery of the ivy as a "green throat" and its final act of "closing over" the door charges the ending with significant symbolic weight. The environment actively constrains the character and deepens the resonance of her departure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict between Maren’s need for anonymity and the world’s insistence on gratitude is clear and escalates effectively through Petra's physical intrusion. The stakes are personal and well-defined; the cost of the final choice—the surrender of her safe, ghostly identity—is palpably felt on the page. The pressure remains coherent under a situational lens that forces a stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity and the burden of unpayable debts is sophisticated and woven well through the moon rock symbol. However, the dialogue line "That's reciprocity" acts as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the subtext in a way that feels slightly didactic for this level of craft. Despite this, the resolution offers a resonant answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and idiosyncratic, blending logistical precision with repressed emotion to create a distinct perceptual signature. The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Maren’s guarded interiority while allowing the humor to function as a character trait rather than just authorial wit. The tone modulates effectively from defensive joking to solemn acceptance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("humor a tourniquet," "green throat mid-swallow") with no visible scaffolding or loops. The sentence-level craft supports the story’s tension, utilizing specific, non-generic details that heighten the atmosphere. The writing achieves a high level of polish and propulsion suitable for a competitive market.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of a "ghost logistician" is a fresh, specific synthesis of disaster relief tropes and character study. The combination of the ruined setting, the moon rock, and the "improbable rumor chain" creates a unique narrative texture. The story transforms a potentially standard encounter into a memorable reflection on connection and obligation.</comment>
