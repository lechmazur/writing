<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren’s internal landscape is rendered with "sturdy" consistency; the shift from passive sufferer to active transmuter of grief is earned by the visceral cost paid in the courtyard. The motivation to "sandpaper" memory integrates perfectly with her final action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is definitive and resonant, with the change in her hands acting as physical proof of the internal shift. The transition via sleepwalking is slightly passive but fits the dream-logic tone and prompt constraints without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The fossil-seabed setting is not just a backdrop but the engine of the plot; the imagery of "bruised sky" and "tiny tidal pools" creates a cohesive, suffocating atmosphere that releases perfectly at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The climax escalates pressure through physical sensation ("bones became coral"); the cost is palpable and leaves a permanent mark ("brittle translucence"), satisfying the demand for consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of processing grief—not removing it, but "wearing the jagged edges down"—is sophisticated and lands beautifully in the final image of the bread tasting only of simple ingredients.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, maintaining a specific "sturdy" distance that matches Maren’s character while allowing intimacy in the sensory details. No POV slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with strong rhythm; the metaphor of the fortress holding water "like a body holding grief" sets a high bar immediately. No scaffold or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While the empath-chef trope is familiar, the synthesis with the fossil-coral fortress and the specific "sandpapering" metaphor creates a distinct and memorable emotional logic.</comment>
