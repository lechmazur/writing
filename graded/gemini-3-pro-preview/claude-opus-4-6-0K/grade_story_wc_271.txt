<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nasreen’s internal landscape is vivid and embodied; the trauma is felt physically ("legs going rigid") rather than merely labeled. While the "somatic markers" exposition leans toward diagnostic therapy-speak, her explicit rejection of that "clinical vocabulary" in favor of her own metaphor ("weather she lived inside") preserves character integrity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Situational drive lens: stasis, trigger, coping, and earned stasis. The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the act of pruning becomes a reassertion of control, though the helicopter coincidence is a standard external trigger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the action; the lemon oil is not just decoration but the specific tool used to resolve the climax. This functional use of sensory detail to constrain choice and break the freeze meets the high-band standard for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are internal but clearly dramatized; the helicopter serves as a sufficient pressure point to force a tightening of options (freeze vs. ground). The cost is legible in the physical difficulty of the moment and the weight of the photograph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The final image of the "garden awake" provides earned resonance, but the mid-story thematic summary ("This was her motivation laid bare...") is overly explicit. Telling the reader the theme directly reduces the subtextual power of her actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, managing the shift from the traumatic memory to the immediate sensory experience with skill. Focalization remains tight on Nasreen, effectively filtering the world through her specific trauma and expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and dense ("soil that tasted of brine," "living architecture"). While "pulse a drum" is a minor stock metaphor, the sensory specificity elsewhere (lemon oil description) is sharp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Using gardening as a metaphor for trauma recovery is a familiar trope. However, the specific mechanism of the "pearl" and the drone/helicopter parallel adds enough specific, grounded detail to elevate the execution above the generic.</comment>
