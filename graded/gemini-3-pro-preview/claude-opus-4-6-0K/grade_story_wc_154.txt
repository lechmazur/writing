<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is rich and specific to her profession, grounding the emotional arc in concrete skills ("decode the thing behind the thing"). However, the relationship with Suki is largely established through retrospective summary rather than dramatized interaction, given the child is unconscious. The attribute "shrewdly innocent" appears as a label attributed by another character rather than being demonstrated through a difficult on-page choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is linear and cohesive, effectively utilizing the "reading the cast" device to drive the beat. Orientation is solid. The closure ("Lena stayed") works as Earned Stasis, though the cost of staying—what she is giving up—is implied rather than dramatized, making the final decision feel slightly low-stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with tactile specificity that enhances the theme; the contrast between the "ridged surface" of the brain coral and the plaster cast effectively anchors the scene. The "mist-clad atrium" establishes a mood that permeates the reading, though the personification ("held its breath") is a touch standard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emotional pressure escalates effectively as Lena decodes the messages, deepening the connection. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and retrospective. Because the alternative to "staying" (leaving/abandoning the girl) isn't pressurized with an immediate conflicting obligation or danger, the climax feels inevitable rather than a hard-won trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of translation as healing is poignant but over-articulated. The paragraph explicitly explaining "Grafting new meaning onto old wounds" and "Rewriting the story" functions as a thematic summary that preempts the reader's own realization, reducing subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely filtered through Lena's perspective. It occasionally drifts into slightly elevated "therapy-speak" ("body learning a new architecture of healing") that feels more like authorial insertion than the character's immediate thought process under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery in the translation segments. However, a few metaphors strain for effect ("lotus-hearted shape") or lean into abstraction ("architecture of healing"). The density of figurative language in the reflective sections slightly slows the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central conceit—a translator decoding a child's trauma from a plaster cast—is a fresh, compelling synthesis of character and plot. It avoids the generic "hospital bedside" tropes by focusing on the specific act of translation, though the emotional execution leans slightly toward the sentimental.</comment>
