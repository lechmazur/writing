<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is distinct and deeply embodied; the "resin" metaphor for her obsession connects internal state to physical sensation effectively. Her agency in cataloging the end of the world drives the narrative, and the acceptance of the final cost is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A flawless Accumulative arc that gathers weight toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with the completion of the glyph, effectively recontextualizing the darkness from a void into a structured space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting acts as a crucible; the specific acoustics of the fort and the visual of the "needle" star constrain and sharpen the action. The "ambered hush" is palpable, treating silence as a physical medium.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are cosmic yet intimately felt; the pressure of the fading star forces a clear, timed response. The cost—walking into a permanent night—is accepted, though a slightly sharper personal sacrifice could heighten the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding structure within loss is profound. However, the penultimate paragraph ("It was not a map that would show anyone the way...") over-articulates the subtext, explaining the metaphor rather than letting the resonance stand alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice successfully blends mythic ("oracle," "parapet") and scientific ("asymptote," "supernovae") registers to create a unique texture. The required phrase "mildly obsessed" creates a slight tonal ripple but is integrated well into the cartographer analogy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high-value imagery ("dead skin," "resin"). The reprise of "ambered hush" creates a satisfying textural loop at closure. The rhythm supports the slow, settling mood of the piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of "mapping silence" revitalizes the familiar "dying earth" trope with a fresh, sensory-focused methodology. The synthesis of cartography and prophecy feels distinct and non-obvious.</comment>
