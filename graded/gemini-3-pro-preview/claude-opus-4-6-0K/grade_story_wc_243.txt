<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maren's internal voice is distinct, but the reconciliation is frictionless; Elise functions more as a reward than an agent of pressure. The immediate acceptance belies the "eleven years" of abandonment, missing a beat of hesitation or conflict that would earn the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The structure is a clean linear vignette that lands a resonant closing image, but it lacks a causal complication within the scene itself. The inciting incident (arrival) leads directly to the resolution without an intervening test of commitment or meaningful obstacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral; the jetty and the specific materiality of the walnut ink constrain the action and charge the final image. The "between elements" atmosphere perfectly anchors the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are high in backstory but low in scene; the arrival of Elise resolves tension rather than escalating it. Maren faces no difficult trade-off or on-page cost to restart the covenant, making the "haunted" weight feel asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of preserving small moments lands powerfully in the final image. However, the section detailing "proximate causes" reads like an authorial manifesto, temporarily pausing the narrative to explain the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Maren's specific "archivist" worldview. The pacing appropriately mirrors the "gently thorough" process of the ink-making.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong sensory density. Some phrasing drifts into overwritten sentiment ("ghost of joy," "dominoes made of breath"), but the rhythm generally supports the mood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "walnut-ink archivist" is a strikingly fresh concept that elevates a standard reunion trope. The specific synthesis of craft and memory gives the story a unique and memorable texture.</comment>
