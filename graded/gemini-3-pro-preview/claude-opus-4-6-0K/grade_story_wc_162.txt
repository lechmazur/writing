<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is rendered with high specificity, particularly in how she filters grief through the technical lens of her inheritance (wood grain). The emotional arc—moving from estrangement to a reconfigured understanding of her father’s silence—is earned through the interaction with the logbook rather than unprompted epiphany. Her reaction to the "necessary distances" feels embodied and distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Accumulative track, using the decoding of the logbook to build pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration of the father-daughter relationship. The closure is excellent; the translation of the weather codes into a message of observation satisfies the setup with emotional cost (the realization comes too late for interaction). The surreal nature of the drifting terrace is accepted within the story's logic without breaking orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and serves the theme well; the "fractured hush" and "prismatic light" create a liminal space that mirrors Maren’s internal state. The physical details of the table ("tight-grained, patient") ground the surrealism of the drifting terrace. The environment actively participates in the mood, though the "drift" mechanics remain purely atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the nature of her father’s distance—is tightened effectively by the discovery of the logbook entries. The conflict is retrospective, yet the pressure mounts as the pattern of dates emerges, forcing a re-evaluation of the past. The cost is felt in the final realization: the connection existed, but went unrecognized until death made it unbridgeable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis is exceptional. The contrast between the father’s public work (mazes designed to confuse) and his private record (clear skies designed to see) creates a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of his love. The final image of "CAVOK" recharges the motif of distance without resorting to a simple moral, effectively repricing the history of their separation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely aligned with Maren’s perception. The shift between the technical language of the logbook/wood grain and the emotional reality is handled smoothly. The tone maintains a "fractured hush" that suits the drifting setting, with no slips in register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("lost the way a river loses a tributary"). The integration of the required phrase "featherly determined" is handled with surprising grace, turning a potential awkwardness into a strong simile about persistence. Sentence rhythm varies effectively to control the pacing of the reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central conceit—a non-pilot father using aviation weather codes to secretly track his estranged daughter’s life—is a fresh and poignant specific that elevates the familiar trope of posthumous discovery. This specific invention anchors the emotional logic and gives the story a unique identity.</comment>
