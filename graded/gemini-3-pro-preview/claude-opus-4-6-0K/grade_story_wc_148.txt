<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is deeply rooted in the specific "curse" of his lineage, driving a clear goal-directed action. The internal struggle between the inherited compulsion and the grief of the moment is well-rendered, and his agency in breaching the cistern feels earned by the backstory. The emotional beat at closure—hovering between grief and repose—lands with genuine weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight; the obstacle (concrete) is overcome specifically because the father's warning (rot) was accurate, beautifully integrating backstory with present action. The closure is a clean Decisive Change—obtaining the proof creates a legible "after" state. The narrative arc from entry to discovery is efficient and logically sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and active; the "copperlight" and "salt-crusted" textures create a pervasive atmosphere that constrains the mood. The specific oddity of the confessional and the scuffed door frames the narrative path effectively. The environment charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for setting-driven resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proof versus erasure—is signaled early and drives the escalation. While the physical resistance is somewhat low (the concrete yields easily, though justifiably), the pressure of the deadline and the weight of the "curse" sustain tension. The discovery forces a crystallization of stance for Marcus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inversion of the "boy who cried wolf" fable into a curse of unbelievable truth is a resonant thematic engine. The transition from "chasing hush" to letting the dead speak provides a satisfying thematic resolution without heavy-handed moralizing. The ending recontextualizes the "wolf-crier" legacy into evidence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent atmospheric pressure that matches the protagonist's internal state. The perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on details like "old pennies" and "mineral stillness" that fit the character's inherited burden. POV distance is controlled well throughout the descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("mineral stillness, the scent of bones long past their grieving") without stalling momentum. Sensory details do double duty, advancing the atmosphere and the plot simultaneously. No significant artifacts or loops; the rhythm supports the descent into the labyrinth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the fable with a noir-tinged recovery mission in a lighthouse prison is fresh and specific. The concept of "foundation rot" serving as both the warning and the means of entry is a clever, non-obvious connection. The emotional specificity elevates the premise beyond a standard fetch quest.</comment>
