<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's profession as a chalk artist beautifully frames the resolution of impermanence and drives the final choice. Motivation is clear, though the specific attribute "socially perceptive" is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized in the present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, effectively reframing the "unlearning" as transformation with visible conceptual cost. The narrative arc is clean, though the epiphany relies on a slightly convenient environmental trigger (the tile) to precipitate the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto is a participant, not just a backdrop; its acoustics and architecture (tiles, sand) actively drive the plot mechanics and resolution. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-specific, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate yet high, centering on the preservation of meaning. The protagonist's agency drives the climax (speaking the word), leading to a legible cost: the abandonment of the old language for a new, uncertain form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of transience is handled with nuance, moving from grief to adaptation. The explicit articulation of the theme ("language molting") in the penultimate section slightly softens the implicit power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely filtered through Sable's artistic perspective. The transition from silence to a "new alphabet" is supported by the rhythm and texture of the prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich ("geometric voids," "emergent hush") with high information density. Imagery consistently serves the story's logic, avoiding empty ornamentation despite the lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a linguistic apocalypse with a specific architectural setting and an artist's trade creates a fresh narrative. The resolution avoids generic "fixing" tropes in favor of a specific, grounded adaptation.</comment>
