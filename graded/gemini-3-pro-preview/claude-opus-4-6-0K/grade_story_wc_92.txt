<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren is a highly competent protagonist with clear motivation rooted in justice for the undercity. The lack of internal conflict or hesitation during the heist makes the execution feel slightly too smooth; the "calmly inventive" trait is told via a diagnostic label rather than dramatized through a struggle that forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, effectively using the blackout trigger to drive the lock adjustment and the resulting rerouting of light. Closure is a solid Decisive Change that alters the world state, though the absence of a "felt cost" (loss, sacrifice, or immediate danger) caps the score below the highest bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting details—phosphor-veins, the violet edge of twilight, and the half-painted sundial—are vivid and structurally integral to the plot. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices (darkness requiring the glass rod) and charges the final image of the forking light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (treason, revolution), and the pressure of the "hush" is tangible. However, the narrative lacks active opposition or a specific on-page obstacle that tests Maren’s agency; the plan proceeds without a snag, limiting the escalation of tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "quiet systemic rewiring" versus violent revolution is well-developed and resonates through the imagery of the "Cradle of Sparks." The ending image of light flowing into the undercity perfectly resolves the "lantern" motif introduced in the opening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, suiting the "vigilant sentinel" persona with a slightly elevated, observational tone. The POV remains stable with Maren, though the interiority leans occasionally into summary rather than immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, particularly in the description of the "winking" walls and the "cipher" of the sundial. Sentence rhythm is varied and propulsive, with no significant scaffold artifacts or loops hindering the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "unfinished art as dead drop" and the "phosphor-vein" technology offers a fresh take on steampunk tropes. The concept of a revolution via maintenance reports and lock adjustments feels distinct and grounded.</comment>
