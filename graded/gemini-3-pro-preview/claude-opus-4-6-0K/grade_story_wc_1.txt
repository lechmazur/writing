<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on summary and abstract labels ("liminal," "frequency") rather than embodied struggle to depict the shift from revenge to purpose. The protagonist observes her transformation more than she enacts it through difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulation of clues leads to a clear discovery, but the causal link between frost patterns and specific numeric coordinates requires suspension of disbelief despite the water-vein explanation. Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise, though the cost of delay is abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the method of discovery; the specific interplay of frost, sandstone, and light anchors the protagonist’s expertise. Sensory details are vivid and consistently filtered through the glass artist's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation is low-voltage; the threat is retrospective (11 days ago), and the protagonist operates in safety without an antagonist forcing immediate trade-offs. The stakes of the final decision are intellectual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central metaphor of glass and transformation coheres well, but the final paragraph reduces resonance to an explicit moral statement ("light must first pass through..."). This didactic summary flattens the ambiguity of the ending image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, confident, and appropriately lyrical, successfully blending technical artistry with the natural environment. The narrative distance remains stable, intimately close to Maren’s perception without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density ("molten silica," "pink ridges"). The writing avoids major artifacts, though the repetition of "strange" in the opening paragraphs is a minor friction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of glassblowing expertise with tracking smuggler routes via frost is a genuinely fresh concept. While the "healing in nature" arc is traditional, the specific mechanical execution elevates the premise.</comment>
