<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation—"precision as a form of respect" rather than revenge—is a sophisticated, character-specific driver that elevates the narrative above standard mystery tropes. The contrast between her "blithe" public persona and the heavy, precise private work creates a compelling internal landscape that justifies her final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight causal lens: the ritual leads to decoding, which yields a specific realization (the grave's location) that forces the closure decision. The discovery that Celia is buried in the cemetery is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's relationship to her workspace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the "pale column" of starlight in the silo is required for the decoding work, and the tapestry functions as a micro-setting that dictates the physical action. The sensory details ("wool coat like an old friend") are precise and grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively from historical curiosity to personal tragedy when the decoded message reveals Celia's specific fate and location. The pressure is consistent and intellectual, though the lack of immediate external opposition keeps the tension slightly quieter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of memory as an act of precision is woven flawlessly through the action, culminating in the final image of the song which recontextualizes "making something gentle grow" as an act of defiance. The subtext regarding the weight of the dead is palpable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a polished, lyrical consistency that mirrors Marguerite's careful nature. The transition from the objective description of the silo to the internal weight of the "uncharted echoes" is managed with smooth control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with memorable imagery ("ghost practicing to disappear") that serves character and mood without stalling momentum. The rhythm of the decoding sequence matches the methodical nature of the task.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardening, embroidery steganography, and the chess ritual creates a fresh, specific premise. The refusal to turn the story into a violent revenge fantasy demonstrates a mature and original engagement with the genre.</comment>
