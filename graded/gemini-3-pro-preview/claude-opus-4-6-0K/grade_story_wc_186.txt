<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maret is a distinct protagonist whose retrocognitive gift is integrated as a lived sense that shapes her worldview rather than a convenient plot device. Her internal transition from ritualistic maintenance to active, targeted hope is earned through the procedural accumulation of the star maps, though the stakes remain largely internal until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on backstory and summary (the discovery of the prism, the eleven months of tracking) to build context, which delays the onset of the immediate scene's pressure. However, this accumulation pays off in the "shard of hush" alignment, and the closure—a Charged Poise of waiting—lands with earned weight and clarity under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glass pavilion is an exceptional example of setting-as-instrument; its acoustic properties ("deepest-voiced pane") and interaction with the spectral light actively constrain the method and drive the resolution. The sensory details are vivid and purposeful, grounding the ethereal concept in concrete physical interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily textural—faith versus entropy—and while the external pressure is low, the internal stakes are sharply defined and escalate effectively as the pattern completes. The silence when the humming stops provides a decisive pressure point that forces the protagonist's realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of broken things serving a higher purpose is resonant, but the explicit internal monologue stating "Coincidences had meaning" in the final moments is a Thematic Echo that explains what the image should show. This "telling" slightly flattens the subtextual power of the beacon's alignment and the closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, perfectly matching the "cathedral of breath" atmosphere without slipping into purple prose. The modulation of tone during the retrocognitive vision—shifting from observation to certainty—is handled with precise narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and dense ("stubborn and spined and alive"), sustaining a high-literary tone that supports the story's logic. While the "ink in water" simile is a minor cliché, the rest of the imagery is fresh, specific, and functionally integrated into the plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story creates a fresh synthesis by combining post-apocalyptic tropes with acoustic physics and retrocognition. The specific invention of the "shard of hush"—a calibrated silence used as a key—is an ingenious concept that elevates the standard "decoding a message" plot.</comment>
