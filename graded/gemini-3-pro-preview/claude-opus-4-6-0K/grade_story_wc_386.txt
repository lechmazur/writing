<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose unique professional constraint ("weaves truth carefully") shapes her methodology. Her motivation ("salvage something pure") is palpable, driving the scene's action and grounding the final resolution in character-specific values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving effectively from hypothesis to confirmation via a clear causal mechanism (the snow globe/shrine interaction). Closure lands with a Decisive Change in stance—from suspicion to a committed plan of exposure—anchored by the specific evidence retrieved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vivid, atmospheric, and functions causally as the "antenna" required for the plot. The "melted snow globe" serves as an excellent micro-setting/tool that constrains the visions and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high (truth of 43 deaths) and pressure escalates cleanly through the sequence of visions, culminating in a direct plea ("find me"). While the external resistance in the scene is low, the weight of the revealed truth provides sufficient felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory as persistence ("murmur... through the living") is beautifully integrated with the plot mechanics. The ending successfully reweights the concept of "salvage" from physical recovery to the preservation of narrative truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and confident, perfectly matching the "ghost whisperer" persona. Perceptual details (candle flames leaning, fused glass) are consistently filtered through Maren's specific professional expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density and no visible artifacts. Phrasing like "brief apertures where one consciousness pressed against another" demonstrates high craft that serves the story's logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, collective dream analysis, and indigenous shrine magic creates a fresh, compelling procedural frame. The specific execution avoids generic "medium" tropes, offering a unique lens on the ghost story genre.</comment>
