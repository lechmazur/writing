<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is inextricably linked to the backstory of the avalanche, creating a palpable internal pressure. The shift from the "unpardonable" silence to the courage of the broken note is earned not through epiphany but through the tangible, physical discovery of the bench. The internal contradiction (devotion to duty vs. the need to express grief) is resolved with a costly, imperfect action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight causal chain: the discoloration leads to the bench, which forces the confrontation with the past. The closure—a "terrible" but "beautiful" sound—is a Decisive Change that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to his survival. The pacing effectively balances the inciting investigation with the emotional weight of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting acts as an active constraint; the "cobalt fortress" and the ice preserve the silence that Oren must break. The sensory details (the humming radiators, the cold piano bench) are not merely atmospheric but drive the narrative logic—the bolt mark is a setting detail that creates the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are intensely personal and clearly escalated. The conflict moves from a static state of penance to an acute crisis upon finding the bench. The cost is legible on the page: the note is "cracked" and "frostbitten," acknowledging that breaking silence offers no easy relief, only the "unbearable courage of continuing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The parallel between the patients' nerve regeneration ("phantom signals") and Oren's psychological recovery is a sophisticated thematic engine. The story resists a tidy moral, positing instead that safety can be a "burial," and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of survival guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined, lyrical consistency that suits the conservatory setting. The shift in perspective to the doctor and patient downstairs serves as a second "shard" that validates the climax without breaking the tonal spell, effectively utilizing the Track A two-shard allowance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. There is a slight redundancy in "phantom signals, ghost sensations" (synonym loop), and the metaphorical density is high ("mechanical prayers," "genuflection," "seraphically mundane"), but the control remains strong enough to support the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of a bellhop recognizing a missing bolt via discoloration is a fresh, grounded detail that revitalizes the trope of the silent survivor. The synthesis of the rehabilitation setting with the ruins of a conservatory creates a unique and memorable narrative space.</comment>
