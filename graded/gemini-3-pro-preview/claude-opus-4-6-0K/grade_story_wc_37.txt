<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s deficit (memory loss) is beautifully integrated into her role, but her success feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult, conflicting choice in the moment. She acts exactly as a Keeper should without a moment of hesitation or deviation that would heighten the character drama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear and the closure—restoration at the cost of personal retention—lands with resonance, but the "song unlocking" beat lacks mechanical resistance. The solution arrives somewhat conveniently via the whisper, smoothing over the potential for a more jagged narrative turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mica window functioning as a prism for sound is a standout use of setting to drive plot mechanics rather than just backdrop. The "condensed twilight" fruit and "iron ribs" build a cohesive, vivid atmosphere that actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the global stakes are high (world dying), the immediate scene lacks a tightening screw; the dawn-child is saved by a single correct action without a complication or escalated cost within the scene itself. Maren succeeds on her first attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of "forgetting everything except how to begin" is a sophisticated landing that reframes the protagonist's deficit as grace. However, the expository paragraph about village contagion externalizes the theme through telling rather than keeping it subtextual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice suits the fable-like quality, but the shift to omniscient observation of the villages ("In villages she could not see...") dilutes the otherwise tight, isolated focalization. It resolves the scope problem by stepping outside the established POV constraints.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic ("split whatever glow touched them into layered, trembling bands") with high information density and no scaffold. The montage of the waking villages is a bit generic in its imagery compared to the specificity of the greenhouse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synesthetic transformation of light-physics (mica) to sound-physics is creative, revitalizing the otherwise standard "sing to heal the world" premise. The core narrative arc remains a familiar fantasy trope executed with high polish.</comment>
