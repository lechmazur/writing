<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct focal point, but her internal landscape is often delivered via summary ("She wants to discover...") rather than dramatized through friction or difficult choices. Her resignation is well-rendered, but the emotional arc feels static; we see the result of her processing rather than the active struggle of it under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The climax hinges on a massive coincidence—stumbling upon the exact container holding her specific death certificate in a shifting labyrinth of thousands. This "lucky find" undercuts the agency of her search and resolves the narrative question too conveniently, even if the final gesture of layering provides thematic closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and active; the concept of tides physically rearranging the "stacks" creates a unique, shifting constraint that dictates movement and access. The atmosphere of "mechanical indifference" permeates the physical descriptions effectively, grounding the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes are existential, but the on-page conflict is low-temperature; Maren observes and collects rather than battling active opposition. The escalation relies on the serendipitous discovery of the certificates rather than rising pressure forcing a difficult trade-off or tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The exploration of "erased histories" and the contrast between the "honest" poison label and the dishonest official records is compelling and well-executed. The ending resonates, creating a "map" that validates the invisible without offering a false, tidy reinstatement of their lives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent, matching the melancholic, detached tone of the protagonist. Transitions between the bureaucratic backstory and the surreal present are smooth, and the "library of vanished lives" frame filters perception distinctly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is high-quality with strong imagery ("digested her identity"), though the climax veers into abstraction ("grain of erased histories pressing back"). Occasional filtering ("Maren perceives," "feels the texture") distances the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience in the final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a container city for the disenfranchised is a familiar trope, but the specific angle of "clerical ghosts" and the tide-shifting labyrinth adds a fresh, surreal layer. The synthesis of bureaucracy and mythic geometry feels distinct.</comment>
