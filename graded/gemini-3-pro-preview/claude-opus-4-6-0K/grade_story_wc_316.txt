<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selu’s internal state of "ego death" is established with specific, embodied detail ("smoke through a keyhole"), creating a distinct starting point. The pivotal shift from numbness to feeling is compressed but grounded in the specific interaction with her mirror image, earning the emotional arc through the clone's foil dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly structured around the hearing, with clear orientation and consistent pacing. The judge’s ruling feels slightly summary-heavy and convenient, functioning as a mechanical stamp rather than a beat of procedural tension, but the emotional closure lands effectively with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "compressed bone" canyon and "pink and ridged" brain provide vivid, visceral anchors that ground the surreal premise. The shifting geology effectively mirrors the internal instability, charging the setting with thematic weight that pays off in the final ocean image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and high (losing a child), driving the protagonist's choices. The combat escalates naturally from legal arguments to physical struggle, and the turn—finding weakness in the clone’s strength—is a satisfying, agent-driven reversal that forces a compromise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "complementary brokenness" is resonant and arises organically from the plot's central conflict. The final image of the "new ocean" successfully reconfigures the premise of instability into possibility (Conceptual Repricing) without heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, balancing the protagonist's detachment with poetic observation. The dialogue serves the conflict well, though lines like "You're drowning in it" tilt slightly toward explication of the subtext rather than letting the action speak alone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density, utilizing strong verbs like "vivify" and specific imagery like the "strange reliquary." The simile "sliced through pretense like a blade through silk" is a rare cliché in an otherwise fresh textural landscape.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a custody battle against one's own clone in a shifting temporal dojo is inventive and executed with commitment. The synthesis resolution is familiar in martial arts tropes but is revitalized by the specific sci-fi context of the clone's emotional overflow.</comment>
