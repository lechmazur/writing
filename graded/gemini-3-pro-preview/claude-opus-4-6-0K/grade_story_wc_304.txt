<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's unique dual profession perfectly frames the narrative logic and emotional arc. Her internal state is consistent, and the transition from preparing bodies to preparing the world feels earned and inevitable. The characterization drives the plot, though the central decision is handled partly in reflective summary rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The structure is coherent and effective for an elegy, utilizing an Accumulative lens that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with a tangible change in the world state (the aurora captured, the world "prepared"). The narrative relies heavily on internal reflection over active scene conflict, which slightly softens the dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, acting as both the subject of the story and the pressure cooker for the protagonist. Sensory details—specifically the interplay of light and silence—effectively charge the atmosphere. The grotto and aurora are active participants in the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The situational pressure of the ending world is established early, but the central choice (what to record) is presented as the result of prior contemplation rather than an immediate on-page struggle. The stakes are high conceptually, but the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs within the scene limits the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in death is resonant and organically developed through the mortician metaphor. The ending creates a lingering emotional effect. However, explicit thematic statements in the narration ("Now the dead one was the world itself," "She had done what she had always done") slightly reduce the subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, reverent, and precise, perfectly matching the protagonist's trade. The narrative distance is controlled. A slightly more distinct perceptual signature during the observation phase could have elevated the voice further, but it remains polished and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in the descriptive passages. The imagery is sharp ("hollowed geode," "mineral coffin"). Minor reliance on expository telling to bridge the premise and the action prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mortuary science and planetary apocalypse is fresh and executed with commitment. The concept elevates a standard "last person on earth" trope into something specific and poignant.</comment>
