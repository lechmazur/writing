<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Luma is a standout protagonist whose profession informs her perception and interiority deeply. The decision to expend scarce resources for a free display creates a visible, tangible cost that validates her internal shift from despair to defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Causal arc where the rumor drives the search, and the discovery forces a Conceptual Repricing of her role. The closure is decisive and earned, reconfiguring the "weight" of the opening into fuel for the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting acts as a constraint and catalyst; the starless sky and the "phosphorescent lichen" are not just decor but active elements that force Luma to "make the sky." The sensory detail of jasmine bordering on grief is precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conflict is internalized but potent, pitting the gravity of post-war hopelessness against the necessity of art. The stakes are raised by her poverty, making the final choice to burn her inventory a significant sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of generating wonder in a void is handled with restraint and specific grounding in the character's trade.

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly controlled, filtering the world consistently through the lens of a fireworks designer. The transition from the chant to the technical assessment of the rag knot demonstrates excellent distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with no scaffolding or loops; images like "the chapel exhaled into amber" are striking and efficient. The rhythm varies purposefully between the chant and the technical actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of chemistry, fireworks, and post-war ruin creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The premise of leaving a message in a mosaic for a colleague is a unique and compelling hook.</comment>
