<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence and observation are well-drawn, creating a distinct internal landscape. However, her rapid transition from skeptic to active participant in the supernatural ritual lacks a moment of resistance or doubt to ground the shift in character reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the ritual establishment works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, however, relies on a summary "explain-everything" conclusion ("The lamp never flickered out again") rather than letting the scene’s ambiguity linger with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and sensory, particularly the "brine and old iron" and the fractured lens. The specific geometry of the cairns serves as an effective micro-setting that grounds the supernatural elements in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (light/safety) is clear, but the conflict is resolved with minimal friction; the "ghost" is immediately benevolent, and the lamp is fixed without complication. The cost is abstract (secrecy) rather than viscerally felt in the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit narration that "tells" the meaning ("It was not malice... it was the desperate wish"). The final paragraph acts as a moralizing summary, flattening the resonance of the cairn image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and meditative, fitting the protagonist’s solitude. The "warmly observant" tone holds steady, though it occasionally drifts into slightly precious phrasing ("ferrying... silence") that draws attention to the writing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmical, with high readability. The score is capped by the structural reliance on a concluding summary paragraph that explicates the subtext rather than trusting the final image to carry the weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of lighthouse, ghost, and storm is a familiar trope cluster. While the cairn language adds a specific, fresh layer, the benevolent ghost and the dutiful keeper dynamic tread very worn ground.</comment>
