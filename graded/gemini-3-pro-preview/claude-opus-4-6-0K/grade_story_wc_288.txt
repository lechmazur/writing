<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is distinct, but the character arc is conveyed through summary rather than dramatized choice. The shift from "exile" to "independence" is stated as a completed process ("She began to translate...") rather than shown through a specific moment of struggle or decision under pressure, creating emotional distance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a habitual summary ("For weeks," "Each morning") rather than a specific anchored scene, violating the scope default. There is no "now" moment where the change occurs; the story reads like a synopsis of a longer timeline, lacking immediate causal pressure and specific temporal grounding (Orientation Test failure).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "tidal library" concept is vivid and original, but the lack of a specific scene prevents the setting from exerting immediate, tactile pressure on a choice. The description remains panoramic and general ("shifting shelves," "invisible currents") rather than focusing on the sensory grit of a specific interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Escalation is absent because the conflict is narrated from a distance rather than experienced in real-time. The stakes of losing memory vs. gaining independence are clear conceptually, but without a specific scene to test Maren, the tension remains abstract and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The themes of memory and isolation are coherent, but the ending relies on an explicit thematic statement ("She was alone. She was not lonely") rather than a resonant image. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext into a moral lesson, reducing the conceptual power of the final beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is polished but maintains a fable-like distance that prevents immersion. The chronicler-style narration ("She had been a contemporary...") keeps the reader observing Maren's life from the outside, rather than inhabiting her perspective during the critical transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with strong imagery ("surfaced like ice on warm water"), but the reliance on summary leads to repetitive sentence structures ("She began to," "She remembered," "She reorganized"). These template cadences dull the rhythm and reinforce the synopsis-like feel of the text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a tidal library with reincarnation memories triggered by a stone circle is imaginative and fresh. While the execution suffers from summary mode, the core concept and the specific "atomically reflective" sundial offer a unique angle on the memory-keeper trope.</comment>
