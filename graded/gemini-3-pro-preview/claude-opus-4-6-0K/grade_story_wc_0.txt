<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; the protagonist’s professional trait (preprocessing reality) is effectively weaponized as an emotional defense mechanism, creating a tight internal conflict. The shift from efficiency to presence is earned through specific, embodied interaction with the setting rather than abstract rumination. The final renunciation of the "filter" feels authentic and carries the felt cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure fits the Accumulative/Textural lens perfectly, building pressure through the observation of dust and decay until the epiphany lands. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the realization about the butterfly re-weights the protagonist's worldview and prompts a decisive internal change (stopping the preprocessing). The pacing is assured and the arc is complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary antagonist and teacher; the "silt mixed with potting soil" and "powdered glass" provide the tactile resistance needed to ground the internal arc. The specific micro-setting of the butterfly wing dust effectively anchors the cosmic metaphor in concrete reality. Atmospheric details mirror the internal state without feeling heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but clearly defined; the conflict between the desire for control (equations) and the reality of loss (entropy) drives the narrative. Escalation occurs through the deepening attention to the dust patterns, moving from cleaning to photographing to understanding. The pressure coheres well, though the external stakes remain quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of entropy as revelation is powerful and organically developed through the star/butterfly parallel. The score is held back slightly from the highest band because the protagonist explicitly writing the prompt phrase ("Gradual change") in her notebook borders on a Thematic Echo, though it fits her analytical character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, filtering emotional experience through a credible scientific lexicon ("diffraction grating," "nuclear exhaustion") without losing emotional resonance. The distance is well-managed, staying close to Lena’s perception while allowing for broader reflection. The shift in tone at the end mirrors her internal opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("scales so small they were almost conceptual") that serves the character's worldview. Sentence variety effectively controls the pacing, slowing down for the moment of observation. No significant artifacts or loops were detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story offers a sophisticated synthesis of the "scientist processes grief through work" trope. While the core premise is familiar, the execution via the specific imagery of neutron star density vs. greenhouse dust elevates it. The parallel drawn is fresh and specific enough to feel original.</comment>
