<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lena’s motivation to prioritize innovation over franchising is well-dramatized, driving her engagement with the mystery. The shift from suspicion to trust relies heavily on professional intuition but feels earned within her established worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is strong, with a decisive action (the call) grounded in the protagonist's values. However, the plot relies on a convenience: recognizing handwriting from a single comment card saved from a pop-up eleven years ago strains credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative, using sensory details like the "scrubbed raw" sky to mirror the clarity of the moment. The specific botanical details of the *Amorphophallus titanum* ground the premise effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes—intellectual stagnation and corporate pressure versus a risky, creative partnership—are clear and felt. The "year-long" proposition effectively escalates the commitment required at the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The corpse flower serves as an excellent organic symbol for the theme of difficult, long-term artistic payoff. The narrative creates a resonant argument for patience without becoming didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and confident, blending analytical observation with lyrical interiority. It maintains a consistent close-third perspective that fits the cerebral nature of the protagonist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A significant editing oversight occurs at the climax: the phrase "possibility just born" is repeated verbatim in adjacent sentences, creating a distracting text loop. Otherwise, the prose is polished and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of botany and escape room design offers a fresh perspective on the puzzle genre. The concept of a "room that takes a year to solve" is a compelling, non-obvious hook that elevates the ending.</comment>
