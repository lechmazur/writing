<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Internal state is clear, but the motivation is explicitly stated ("That was her real motivation") rather than purely dramatized. The final epiphany feels slightly unearned by the low-friction interaction, relying on a sudden realization rather than a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is excellent, grounding the reader immediately. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration, though the inciting incident (coffee delivery) and climax (plankton bloom) rely on coincidence rather than causal pressure, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable, using the "pressure-treated glass" and "bioluminescent lighting" to effectively constrain the characters. The setting actively charges the final image of the simulated dawn, fulfilling the 9+ quick test criteria.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are purely internal and relatively low-pressure; the conflict resolves through shared observation rather than a costly tradeoff. Escalation is gentle and accumulative, lacking a decisive tightening of options before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is coherent, but the penultimate paragraph explicitly articulates the moral ("Belonging wasn't a rhythm... It was one you made..."). This diagnostic summary flattens the subtext of the shared silence, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, suiting the "landscape astrologer" persona well. Narrative distance zooms smoothly from the environment to the specific artifact, though the "softly ingenious" descriptor feels slightly self-congratulatory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with strong textural details like the "dark lattice" of the feather. Rhythm is controlled, though a few phrases lean toward the abstract ("shadowseam where wonder lived") without full sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "landscape astrologer" concept is a fresh synthesis that enlivens the standard underwater research trope. The connection between celestial maps and submerged ruins offers a novel specific angle on the search for meaning.</comment>
