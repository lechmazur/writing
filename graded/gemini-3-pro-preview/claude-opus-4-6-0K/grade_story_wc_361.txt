<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sable’s internal state is well-dramatized through physical action (shaking) rather than abstract labels. Her trembling serves as a functional plot mechanic, though the resolution—hands becoming "perfectly still"—feels slightly too tidy given the depth of the established neurosis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a clear disruption (aurora feedback) to a decisive action (leaving the case ajar). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the reliance on the auroras "doing something new" as the catalyst leans slightly on coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the aurora is not just atmosphere but the energy source driving the climax. Specific sensory details like the "green and violet curtains" and "leaves no bigger than eyelashes" ground the magical elements effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, escalating through the feedback loop between Sable's anxiety and the pendant. The final choice to leave the case open forces a trade-off between standard safety protocols and nurturing the new life, creating a functional, if subtle, cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of "sustained attention" is potent but undercut by an explicit essayistic summary in the final third ("Somewhere in the deep past a maker had understood..."). This overt explanation replaces earned resonance with telling, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at the critical juncture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is generally atmospheric and controlled, but the line "That was Tuesday" constitutes a jarring register break. In a high-fantasy context of temples and relics, this modern idiom disrupts immersion and trivializes the established mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While the prose is often vivid, the text suffers from a significant tonal artifact ("That was Tuesday") and a paragraph of abstract thematic exposition that stalls momentum. These slips mar the otherwise polished literary texture required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a biological-mechanical synthesis (vibration inducing germination) transforms the standard courier trope into something fresh. The central image is memorable, though the execution relies on a few standard beats.</comment>
