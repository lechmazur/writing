<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marguerite’s motivation is layered and distinct; her shift from protecting legacy to exposing it is earned through her specific intellectual relationship with her father. The choice to publish the diaries alongside the documents reveals character depth, though the "proof by contradiction" logic feels slightly more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality is tight and the closure is excellent, landing a Decisive Change with visible cost (reputation) and a reconfigured constraint (using the logbooks to reframe the scandal). The narrative drive is consistent, and the "orbits" logic satisfyingly ties the evidence to the final decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly realized and integral to the theme, contrasting the "green copper dome" with the "white sea" of clouds. The physical space actively pressures the protagonist's perspective on her father's "altitude" versus his earthly failures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high—personal memory versus public integrity—and the escalation through the logbook entries adds necessary weight. The final decision forecloses the option of a quiet cover-up, creating a lasting consequence for the protagonist's family legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" concept is masterfully woven into the narrative, transforming a standard corruption plot into a meditation on human failure. The ending achieves a Conceptual Repricing, reframing the father's corruption not as simple evil but as a tragic, elliptical struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric ("liturgical" breathing, "cathedral abandoned by its god"), fitting the solemnity of the setting. Interiority remains tightly controlled within Marguerite’s perspective without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high density. A slight over-reliance on similes ("like a cathedral," "like gravel," "like planetary orbits," "like a white sea") in a short space draws attention to the writing, but the imagery remains coherent and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the "heir discovers corruption" setup is a familiar trope, the specific resolution—publishing the private regrets to contextualize the public crime—feels fresh and specific. The synthesis of mathematical logic and moral choice adds a distinct layer of ingenuity.</comment>
