<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is a sharply drawn protagonist whose competence and longing drive the narrative. Her transition from navigator for others to navigator for herself is earned through the "geography of loss" framework established early on. The internal consistency of her "stubbornness" anchors the speculative elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the status quo of the broken station to the inciting phone calls and final departure. The causality is largely intact, though the "building" of the antenna feels slightly disconnected from the plot driver (the landline calls), serving more as character setup than plot necessity. Closure is decisive and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and specific, with details like the "generator that screamed like a cat" and the "green-black" censer grounding the surrealism. The atmosphere of decay and reconstruction ("ruined coastlines," "poisoned valleys") effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently as the phone calls intensify with the moon phases, culminating in a clear, high-stakes message. The cost of the final choice—abandoning her post and role as navigator—is felt through the preparation of the looping broadcast, balancing the personal gain of the "homecoming."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of navigating loss is woven well through the imagery of the map and the reverse migration. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thematic arc ("building the road to her own raw and necessary homecoming"), which reduces the resonance of the closing image by telling rather than trusting the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly controlled, matching the "patchwork" aesthetic of the protagonist's world. The transition from the technical descriptions of the station to the mythic quality of the phone calls is handled seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically strong, with high information density. Imagery is vivid ("sky so thick with stars it looked like static"). Minor phrasing choices like "not exactly" in the description of the voice feel slightly less precise than the surrounding text, but the overall craft is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes with magic realism (the censer, the moon-phased calls) creates a fresh emotional texture. While the "finding a lost relative via signal" frame is familiar, the "reverse migration" concept and the specific talismanic object elevate the execution.</comment>
