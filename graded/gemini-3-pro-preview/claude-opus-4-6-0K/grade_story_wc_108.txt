<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is compelling, particularly the recontextualization of her phobias as repressed trauma memories ("body remembering what the mind had been forced to forget"). Her motivation shifts clearly from a need for "realness" via fear to a weaponization of vulnerability. The emotional logic holds up under scrutiny, though the realization borders on diagnostic summary rather than purely dramatized experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from orientation in the wreckage to the tactile process of decoding, culminating in a decisive stance shift. The causal chain is solid; the props (cast, shell) actively drive the realization. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the cost (public vulnerability) is acknowledged and accepted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting of the rusted library is excellent, mirroring Mara’s "corroded" identity and providing a thematic backdrop for the reconstruction of truth. The sensory details ("iron skeleton," "books swollen," "stars... like punctuation") are vivid and charge the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—identity and justice versus the safety of the lie. The pressure is largely internal but sustained by the decoding process. The tightening occurs as the fragments coalesce into a name ("Lena Kovic"), narrowing her options to a single, courageous path. A palpable sense of risk underpins the quiet action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "vulnerability as power" is organically woven through the stunt-double premise. The pivot from fear as a stimulant to fear as evidence is distinct and resonant. The explicit articulation of the theme in the protagonist's thought process ("To prove that vulnerability is power") slightly dampens the subtextual impact, keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished but occasionally drifts into a register that feels more authorial than character-bound (e.g., "Not carelessly, but architecturally," "acoustic memory... calcium carbonate"). While the tone matches the atmospheric setting, these intrusions distance the reader slightly from Mara's immediate, lived perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery. However, there is some register drift ("calcium carbonate") and a tendency toward heavy metaphor ("stars... like punctuation marks") that draws attention to the writing itself. The phrase "firmly adaptive" acts as a label rather than a demonstration, though it is quickly supported by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double using her scars/phobias as evidence of a stolen identity is a fresh, specific twist on the amnesia/orphan trope. The synthesis of the setting and the prop decoding elevates the familiar "recovering memories" beat into something distinct and atmospheric.</comment>
