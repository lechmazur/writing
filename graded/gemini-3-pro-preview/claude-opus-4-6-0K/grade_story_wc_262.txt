<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is clear and her interiority is rendered with high specificity ("hated the carnival sound," "eavesdropping on the dead"). The emotional resonance of her trade feels lived-in rather than functional. The characterization balances competence with a genuine openness to the ghost’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and linear, following an Accumulative lens that builds pressure through sensory details and the letters. The closure (writing the return letter) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration that answers the premise. The discovery of the canister feels slightly convenient ("reached for what the reading was pointing her toward"), but the established magic system earns it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the booth is not just a backdrop but a physical constraint and a sensory archive. Details like "cataracts of grime," "carbon arc lamps," and the specific mechanical noises of the projector ground the supernatural elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and thematic; while the pressure to solve the mystery is coherent, the personal cost to Maren remains low. The ending validates the ghost but demands little sacrifice from the protagonist beyond the act of witnessing. Escalation works well within the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story builds a potent atmosphere of longing, but creates a significant artifact by explicitly stating the theme in the final movement ("She understood now that love unexpressed does not vanish..."). This summary flattens the subtext into an authorial explanation, robbing the final image of some interpretive power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical texture that suits the gothic-adjacent tone. Narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Maren’s perception while managing the exposition of her skills naturally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("stack of goodbye letters... rubber band so old it crumbled"). Rhythm is well-managed, accelerating appropriately during the projection sequence. No significant loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry with the mechanics of film projection is fresh and metaphorically rich. While the "ghostly love letter" trope is familiar, the specific execution—using the leader strips and the "Unsent" film—adds a layer of ingenuity.</comment>
