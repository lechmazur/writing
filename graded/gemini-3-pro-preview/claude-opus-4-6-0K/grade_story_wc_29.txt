<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose agency drives the plot; her decision to broadcast is firmly rooted in her established backstory (the pulsar discovery) and current pressure. The choice carries visible professional risk, and her internal state balances fear with a "gritty hope" that feels earned rather than stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight causal chain where Maren's realization forces a decisive action that reconfigures the story's reality. The closure lands a perfect "Charged Poise," shifting the stakes from academic infighting to a high-stakes interspecies chess match with Maren as the exposed player.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the basement station and the physical charts are active tools that constrain Maren's logic and enable her solution. Sensory details like the charts rustling in the vent draft ground the high-concept premise in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a technical anomaly to an existential threat, driven entirely by the protagonist's refusal to accept a binary choice. The immediate capitulation of the faction leaders at the end is slightly convenient for the timeframe, but the shift in power dynamics is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central theme—that predictable intelligence is a vulnerability—is woven directly into the plot mechanics rather than overlaid as a moral. The concept of "learning the architecture of their attention" offers a sophisticated, non-literal thematic resonance that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is authoritative and precise, successfully balancing technical exposition with atmospheric tension. The shift in register during the broadcast—"steady but raw"—demonstrates excellent control of psychic distance and character voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with standout phrasing like "voice whispering beneath a scream" and "fragile, gritty edge of hope." While "burnt coffee and ozone" is a minor genre cliché in the opening, the remaining sentence-level craft is sharp, efficient, and free of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of aliens mapping observation blind spots via recursive signals is a fresh, specific twist on SETI tropes. The protagonist's solution—randomized unpredictability—feels like a genuine intellectual breakthrough rather than a standard plot device.</comment>
