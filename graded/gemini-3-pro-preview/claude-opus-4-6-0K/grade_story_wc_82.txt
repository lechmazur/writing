<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren’s internal state is active and contradictory; she "pours but does not drink" and ascends while descending, grounding abstract grief in physical ritual. The realization that dream recording is "excavation" rather than invention reveals a distinct worldview that drives the narrative logic. Her endurance of the "Severance" creates a powerful form of Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly controlled by the "Severance" phenomenon, which acts as both a ticking clock and a physical escalation of the stakes. Closure lands with high resonance as the ritual completes, achieving a clear reconfiguration of grief into flight without falsely resolving the pain. The mechanics of the magic system perfectly serve the structural needs of the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the action; the basilica walls serve as the projection screen, and the specific physics of the floating isle (shadow detachment) drive the climax. Details like "obsidian paste" and "thermal jasmine" are not merely decorative but functional tools in Maren's craft. The environment actively constrains the character's experience and facilitates the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are deeply felt and clearly escalated by the encroaching dusk and the physical separation of the Severance. The cost is palpable in the "luminous, tormenting moment" where the boundary between memory and loss dissolves. While the conflict is internal, the external pressure of the setting's physics successfully externalizes the struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of grief as "excavation" is sophisticated and organically developed through the mechanics of the dream-gems. The transformation of formless anguish into the precise geometry of paper cranes offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The ending achieves a profound conceptual repricing of loss as something that can take flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical intensity that matches the surreal subject matter. The shift from technical description (polishing, filaments) to emotional release is handled smoothly. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Maren’s sensory experience of the impossible physics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic ("watched and wept and folded"), with strong sensory imagery like "thinning like breath on cold glass." A few metaphors lean slightly into abstraction ("tasted of altitude and longing," "colors that had no names"), which prevents a higher score, but the technical precision elsewhere balances this well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "Severance" mechanic (shadow descending, body ascending) with the lantern-crafting ritual feels fresh and specific. While paper cranes are a familiar trope for grief, their use here as vessels for projected light revitalizes the image. The premise is executed with high conceptual integrity.</comment>
