<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maret is a distinct and compelling focalizer, with interiority grounded in her specific role ("listening was the only insurgency"). However, she lacks internal contradiction or doubt, and her "insurgent grandmother" status seems to armor her against genuine struggle in the scene. The absence of a difficult choice or personal cost keeps the characterization just below the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, moving logically from the kite discovery to the ritual intervention, and the closure offers a clear Conceptual Repricing of the tradition. However, the climax lacks mechanical resistance—the priest merely stands "startled"—which makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through tactical maneuvering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the "thermophilic lichen" and "volcanic vents" are not just scenery but essential tools that drive the plot and solution. The environment constrains the protagonist's choices (requiring the springs to unseal) and charges the final image with resonant sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>While the stakes (destiny vs. potential) are conceptually high, the on-page conflict is low-friction; the antagonist is passive, offering no counter-move to Maret's interruption. The escalation relies on information gathering rather than a clash of wills, resulting in a climax that feels more like a ceremony than a confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The thematic work is strong, using the amber and root imagery to explore the difference between imposition and offering. However, the final sentence explicitly summarizes the thesis ("reconstruction... could finally begin for real"), flattening the resonance of the preceding image which had already conveyed the meaning effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical ("mineral-rich sentences"), creating a strong perceptual signature unique to Maret. The transition from the specific sensory experience of the plants to the broader narrative is handled well, though the final line's shift to authorial summary slightly disrupts the immersive POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and dense ("feeding each meaning... like nutrients through mycelium"), with strong rhythm and imagery. A slight deduction is applied for the final sentence, which acts as a scaffold telling the reader what to think, rather than trusting the powerful image of the dissolving amber.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high ingenuity by synthesizing disparate elements—plant telepathy, genetic amber rituals, and post-war reconstruction—into a coherent and fresh narrative. The "root-language" concept feels inevitable in hindsight, anchoring the fable-like tone in specific, novel mechanics.</comment>
