<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elif is a compelling focalizer whose "gentle radical" persona is dramatized through specific action (renaming) rather than just labels. The micro-choice to use the soldier's lost innocence against him via her expression adds excellent depth to the antagonist interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and tight, fitting the vignette scope perfectly. The causal chain—using the mosaic to generate names, the interruption by the soldier, and the resolution via her power—builds to a resonant "Earned Stasis" closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, particularly the "dome of cracked black glass" sky and the tactile details of the mosaic. The environment is not just background; the mosaic tesserae actively constrain and enable the protagonist's method of resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as life-or-death. The soldier's arrival provides a meaningful tightening of pressure; while the resolution is quiet (a shared look), it is earned by the established mechanics of her empathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis of memory, art, and survival is masterful. The concept of the broken mosaic serving as a cipher for new lives creates a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central problem of erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is poetic and controlled, effectively mediating the "retrocognitive" shifts without confusion. The tone strikes the right balance between the grim reality of the ruins and the tenderness of Elif's mission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("smoke frozen in fracture lines"), though the expository paragraph regarding the psychologists is a slight drag on momentum. The integration of mandatory phrases is handled with grammatical skill, minimizing disruption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core mechanism—using ancient mosaic patterns as a cipher to generate safe surnames—is a genuinely fresh and inventive twist on the dystopian resistance trope, grounding the magic in specific tradecraft.</comment>
