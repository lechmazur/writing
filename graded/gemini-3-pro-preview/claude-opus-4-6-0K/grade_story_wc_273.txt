<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sable’s motivation is intensely specific and drives every on-page action, creating a compelling internal conflict between scientific detachment and raw trauma. The "burning coal" metaphor perfectly embodies her "serene anger," and her final internal shift is a profound, earned reconfiguration of her defining grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a flawless Causal loop, using the three-vial structure to pace the escalation and seamlessly integrate backstory without stalling momentum. Closure is achieved through a powerful Conceptual Repricing that satisfies the central question while transforming the protagonist’s worldview with legible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the "wrong" post-eclipse light and wind-carved acoustics are essential physical triggers for the experiment. The specific environmental constraints—wind currents shaping the ink, light triggering the cortex—are woven tightly into the plot's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are deeply internalized but escalate clearly through the physical progression of the experiment, moving from observation to a visceral reliving of the trauma. The cost is palpable in the physical toll of the time dilation (trembling hands, sensory overload) and the emotional risk of confronting the memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The thematic resolution—reframing the crisis response from cruelty to "deepest attention"—is intellectually satisfying and emotionally resonant. The story achieves this through the specific mechanics of the ink and perception, avoiding abstract moralizing in favor of earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice successfully melds the precision of a researcher with the sensory acuity of a tracker, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature throughout. The shift in narrative texture during the time-dilation moments serves the story’s tension perfectly without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and highly dense, utilizing fresh imagery like "world stretched like heated glass" to convey complex internal states efficiently. Rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of the experiment, and the text is free of scaffolding artifacts or filter loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "tracker" archetype with a neuro-philosophical experiment on grief via disappearing ink is highly original and executed with confidence. The premise transforms familiar tropes of loss into a fresh, specific narrative investigation.</comment>
