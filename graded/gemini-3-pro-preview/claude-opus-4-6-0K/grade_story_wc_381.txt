<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's competence is balanced by the physical toll ("stiff knees") and the solitary burden of her gift, creating a grounded, textured interiority. The choice to erase the prophecy is motivated by a specific, terrifying alternative ("child's laughter twisted"), though the internal conflict is relatively low as her resolve never truly wavers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and process-oriented, successfully dramatizing the abstract concept of "unmaking" through the concrete action of folding. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the return to the "water-words" and the reassembling night confirms the change with a distinct, quiet finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "architecture of hush" and the specific interaction with the brook provide a strong atmospheric grounding for the magic. However, opening descriptors like "molten silver" and "the world held its breath" are slight clichés that detract from the otherwise specific sensory environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively raised by the prophecy's active resistance ("pushing back," "calls of a distant owl"), turning a ritual into a struggle. The resolution feels earned through the specificity of the method, though the antagonist (the prophecy) remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the single wing ("wholeness was overrated") integrates beautifully with the concept of erasure as a mercy. The thematic conclusion—that silence is a "presence of refusal"—is a profound, non-obvious insight that elevates the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the high-fantasy tone without slipping into melodrama. The control over psychic distance allows the transition from the cosmic scale of the prophecy to the physical stiffness of the summoner's knees to feel seamless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and dense with imagery, but the opening paragraph relies on "molten silver" and "held its breath," which are tired phrases. The prompt-required phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is integrated grammatically but feels slightly cumbersome in register compared to the surrounding flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of "folding silence" into paper to create a counter-resonance is a genuinely fresh and ingenious synthesis of magic and craft. Transforming the familiar "solitary mage" trope through this specific, subtractive magic system creates a memorable and distinct artistic vision.</comment>
