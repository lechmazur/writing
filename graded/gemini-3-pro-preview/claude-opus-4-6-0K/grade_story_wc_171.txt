<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren is a compelling, specific protagonist; her "operative gentleness" and physical tremor (nerve damage) ground her professional competence in personal cost. The backstory of dissolved marriages is summary-heavy, but the trembling hand effectively dramatizes the price of her career in the present moment. The secondary characters are largely functional archetypes, serving as props for the negotiation rather than fully realized agents.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and tightly structured around the celestial event, creating natural situational pressure. Closure is decisive and resonant (the signing and the loneliness following it), satisfying the "Resonant Reconfiguration" criteria with felt cost. The mechanics of the oath (moons sealing it) function well as a constraint, though the reliance on a singular ultimatum to resolve a "Forever War" feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the "twin moons" and "ancient terrace" act as active constraints that dictate the pacing and the mechanism of resolution. Sensory details—"limestone like honey," "hummed with a frequency felt in the teeth"—are vivid and purposeful, charging the atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stakes (peace vs. war) are clear and high, and the pressure tightens effectively with the approaching moon conjunction. However, the resolution relies heavily on a rhetorical ultimatum ("teach your grandchildren to hate") that causes entrenched warlords to fold somewhat easily, reducing the feeling of earned difficulty in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of peace as a mundane practice rather than a lofty ideal is poignant and lands well in the final image of the lonely descent. However, the score is capped due to "Thematic Echo": the protagonist explicitly states the story's thesis in dialogue ("Peace is not an ideal. It is a practice"), which reduces subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is authoritative and consistent, blending a lyrical, high-fantasy tone with the grit of negotiation. Maren's internal voice is distinct from the narrative description. The dialogue is elevated and formal, fitting the ritual context, though occasionally it veers into speechifying rather than natural exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is high-quality, with strong rhythm and density (e.g., "words spoken... became chains of celestial iron"). The final triplet ("like a shield, like a child, like proof") is a strong rhythmic closure. No significant scaffolding or repetitive artifacts; line-level craft is polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Focusing a fantasy story entirely on the weary mechanics of a peace treaty is a fresh and welcome angle. While the "magical oath" trope is standard, the focus on the negotiator's personal erosion ("loneliness rushed back in") elevates the concept beyond a simple plot device.</comment>
