<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Nara’s motivation—trading softness for survival and now seeking to translate that cost—is compelling and deeply embodied. The internal conflict is vivid, though the "hard softness" trait feels slightly diagnostic rather than purely demonstrated. The shift to Maia at the end completes the emotional arc effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative structure relies heavily on reflection (approx. 40% of the text), but it remains anchored to the ridge and the box, satisfying the BRR exception. Closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the relationship. The final scene jump, while effective, lacks a formal section break, creating a slight momentary disorientation in the scene window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "white scar" of the path and the "porcelain box full of teeth" are visceral, specific details that ground the abstract themes. The alignment of Jupiter and Saturn provides a cosmic scale that amplifies the intimate setting without overwhelming it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal but deeply felt; the cost of the protagonist's career choice is made visible through the scarring and the estranged daughter. The pressure of the planetary alignment acts as a subtle but effective clock, forcing the crystallization of her intent to keep writing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "bargained innocence" resonates powerfully through the motif of the teeth and the fire. The resolution avoids easy sentimentality, acknowledging the permanent loss ("currency she could never earn back") while allowing for a tentative reconnection. Some thematic points are stated explicitly rather than subtextually.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical and consistent, but the POV switch in the final paragraph acts as a "God's eye" jump without a clear section break, which blurs the narrative distance in a short piece. The perspective remains otherwise tightly controlled and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-band with strong density and rhythm ("topography of fire"). However, the forced insertion of the phrase "by reflecting deeply" results in a syntactic stumble ("turned each one over... by reflecting deeply"), momentarily disrupting the otherwise polished flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of forest firefighting, planetary alignment, and a box of teeth creates a fresh, memorable specific metaphor for parental estrangement. The ending feels earned and original, elevating the "absent parent" trope with a specific, vocation-based cost.</comment>
