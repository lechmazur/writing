<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sable’s motivation—to cure her trembling hands—is embodied and clear, driving the narrative. However, the resolution relies on her following discovered instructions rather than making a difficult, high-stakes trade-off; the internal conflict resolves through ritual rather than a hard choice that tests her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (the trembling stopping via the gear ritual) is distinct and legible. The plot relies heavily on the convenient discovery of the prophecy scraps to explain the solution, which weakens the causal chain, though the use of the collected oil adds a mild resource cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with evocative, specific sensory details like "spines frozen mid-exhale" and "smelled faintly of salt," creating a potent atmosphere. The environment effectively grounds the fable-like tone, though the cold functions more as aesthetic than as a pressure on the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are personal and clear, but the narrative lacks significant external obstacles or escalating tension; the path from problem to solution is linear and unobstructed. The protagonist faces no active opposition, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "rhythm of repair" is beautifully integrated into the imagery of the gears and mirrors. The ending resonates by reframing brokenness as a cycle rather than a failure, though the thematic message is articulated somewhat explicitly in the narration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, maintaining a controlled psychic distance appropriate for the fable-like genre. The narrative authority is strong, and the internal monologue blends seamlessly with the descriptive elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("language of mechanisms... like water through a cracked bowl"). While adjectival density is high ("hauntingly bright," "crystalline"), it remains consistent with the established tone and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of an "eclipse locksmith" is imaginative and distinct, offering a fresh angle on the magical artisan trope. The execution elevates the familiar "magical library" setting through specific, mechanical metaphors for healing.</comment>
