<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cora’s reaction to the vanishing—cataloguing rather than screaming—is a brilliant character beat that grounds her trait of "dynamic observation" in action. The bridge-song fiddler identity feels lived-in and distinct, shaping her perception of the world. However, the internal shift from "never" to resurrection relies heavily on the hitchhiker's aphorism rather than purely internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and decisive, moving efficiently from the inciting incident to a clear closure via the "Decisive Change" of turning the key. The use of the artifact to bridge the gap between the vanish and the decision is structurally sound. The causality is heavily dependent on the supernatural deus ex machina, but it fits the established premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific, particularly the "smoke-blue layers" and the "smell... sharp and antique." The description of the scaffold wrap and the "failing light" effectively creates an atmosphere of eerie potential. The setting actively grounds the supernatural elements in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stakes—Cora's artistic soul and recovery from trauma—are clear and deeply felt. The "impossible thing" successfully escalates the pressure, forcing her to confront her calcified "never." The conflict is primarily internal, resolved perhaps a bit too neatly by the artifact's message, but the emotional cost of hope is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of resurrection is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The hitchhiker's dialogue ("Never is just a photograph...") and the narrator's explication of "pixelated amnesty" explain the meaning to the reader rather than letting the subtext do the work. The resonance is slightly dampened by this explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Cora's musician perspective ("tunes she believed the architecture wanted to sing"). The tone matches the magical realism of the plot. Some phrasing leans toward the performative, but the voice remains distinct and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative, but a significant typo ("calcified inside her likeite in a pipe") disrupts immersion and suggests a lack of proofing in a crucial metaphor. Additionally, phrases like "sculpt possibility from the ashes" veer into cliché/purple prose. These line-level slips undermine the story's literary aspirations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of the specific profession (bridge fiddler) and the wet-plate artifact brings freshness to the "vanishing hitchhiker" trope. While the core arc (ghost inspires protagonist to live again) is familiar, the execution through specific, tactile photography details elevates the material.</comment>
