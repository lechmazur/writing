<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct focalizer with a clear role, but the prompt-mandated traits ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") appear as diagnostic labels rather than dramatized behaviors. Her internal conflict is mild; she processes data via the mirrors rather than grappling with a difficult moral dilemma until the final gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal arc with a legible Decisive Change (refusal of force, sharing vision). The mirror mechanism is established early and effectively drives the investigation, though the "fear not malice" realization resolves the central tension a bit too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric grounding; the "frozen apple trees" and "sounds like old bones" create a vivid, specific texture. The seventeen vintage mirrors serve as an excellent micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's method and focuses the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure is sustained by Haldr’s waiting presence. While the "fear not malice" insight simplifies the geopolitical conflict, the final choice to share the shadow—burdening herself to enlighten him—imposes a legible cost on Maren.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The inversion of shadow as a tool for light ("lantern turned inside out") is a cohesive, resonant thematic image. The ending lands well, though "world tilted one degree closer to mercy" leans slightly into sentimental abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, matching the atmospheric setting well. Narrative distance is generally controlled, though it occasionally slips into explanatory filtering ("She could see," "She knew now") rather than direct immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are polished, but the prose is marred by abstract telling phrases ("raw, unmediated empathy," "courageous anomaly") that flatten subtext. These prompt-derived phrases stick out as inserted exposition rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The specific combination of the lighthouse orchard setting and the shadow-magic system is fresh and evocative. The underlying plot beat—empathy resolving a potential war—is a familiar trope, but the execution via shadow-sharing elevates it.</comment>
