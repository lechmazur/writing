<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s arc from technical calculation to embodied resonance is executed with precision, grounding the climax in a character-specific choice. The internal conflict between her engineer's logic and her emotional connection drives the resolution naturally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight and efficient, utilizing the sunset deadline to create effective pacing without feeling rushed. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a palpable physical cost, resolving the immediate threat while permanently altering the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting acts as an active participant; the "groaning" ice and "living" marina constrain choices and heighten the stakes. Sensory details like the vibration in the teeth and freezing tears firmly ground the fantastical elements in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is managed well, moving from a technical problem to a physically painful endurance test. The climax forces a clear agency-driven trade-off—sharing the dissonance—rather than a passive occurrence, ensuring the stakes are felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "sonic absolution"—healing through adaptation rather than correction—is beautifully integrated into the mechanics of the story. The ending achieves deep resonance without stating a moral, letting the image of sealed cracks speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice successfully blends scientific precision with mythic reverence, suiting the "sacred artifact" premise. A few instances of filter verbs ("could feel," "watched") slightly distance the reader during high-intensity moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and evocative, effectively conveying the auditory nature of the magic. However, minor clichés like "molten gold" and the occasional filter verb preventing total immediacy keep it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of tuning a glacier is inventive, and the resolution via "meeting the break" offers a fresh, empathetic twist on the "healing song" trope. The synthesis of physics and spirituality feels specific and earned.</comment>
