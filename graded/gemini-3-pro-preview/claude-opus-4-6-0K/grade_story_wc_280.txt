<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara is a distinct, atmospheric protagonist whose nature as a "stage ghost" coherently drives the narrative voice and ritual. However, her internal landscape lacks friction; her desire (to perform) and action (performing) align without contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The characterization relies on exposition ("desperate for... one more audience") rather than dramatized struggle, resulting in a somewhat static emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story follows a clean, linear structure of entry, ritual, and result, delivering a legible Resonant Reconfiguration where the timeline is bridged rather than healed. While the causal logic of the magic system is soft, it fits the dreamlike tone. The score is limited by the absence of obstacles; the ritual succeeds immediately without complication or risk of failure, making the plot feel more like a vignette than a narrative with pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, acting as an essential partner in the magic system rather than a static backdrop. The use of synesthesia ("tasted of cinnamon," "violet chords") effectively grounds the supernatural elements in specific sensory details. The orchard feels tactile and distinct from the mundane world, anchoring the ethereal plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story succeeds in building density through the layering of echoes, but it lacks sufficient tension or cost. The stakes ("despair," "fractured timeline") remain abstract, and the protagonist faces no active resistance from the environment or herself. The resolution is earned through procedure rather than struggle, lowering the sense of dramatic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of art stitching together broken time is poignant and organically integrated into the protagonist's identity. The ending offers a sophisticated thematic resolution—bridging the gap rather than fixing it—which adds depth to the concept of the "encore." The resonance is earned through the imagery of the woven echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and appropriately theatrical ("surrendering between the second and third acts"), fitting the persona of a ghost stuck in performance. The tone supports the magical realism without breaking consistency. The distance is well-managed, keeping us close to Elara's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("fruit glowing faintly amber"). However, the score is held back by occasional "telling" summary that preempts the imagery (e.g., "synesthetically blessed," "Elara's motivation was never complicated"). These didactic phrases flatten the otherwise strong show-don't-tell work done by the sensory descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a stage ghost using theatrical echoes to heal timelines is a fresh and creative synthesis of familiar tropes. The execution feels specific and imaginative, particularly the use of the tarot coin as a physical anchor for the sound-based magic. It avoids generic ghost story clichés by focusing on the mechanics of the "encore."</comment>
