<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sable is a competent, empathetic professional, but she lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her efficiency lowers the stakes. The passengers function more as atmospheric props than distinct characters interacting with pressure, and Sable’s success feels inevitable rather than earned through risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "cost" is minimal. The story functions as a ritual enacted perfectly rather than a conflict navigated with consequence; the train whistle sets up a disruption that is resolved by standard procedure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, specific, and functionally integrated; the "prism terrace" and "silver nerves" act as necessary constraints on the action. The sensory details (tooth-aching whine, roiling fog) effectively ground the magical realism in physical experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is the primary weakness; the stakes are atmospheric rather than dramatic. The "turbulence" in the vial is resolved by Sable’s routine expertise without forcing a difficult trade-off or bringing her to a point of potential failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of transit as transformation is handled consistently and resolves clearly in the final image. However, the thesis is explicitly stated ("teach silence how to comfort") rather than emerging solely through subtext, which flattens the resonance slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and well-suited to the ethereal tone. The narrative distance is stable, though the description of the old man’s internal state at the end leans toward telling ("eyes that said he had found...") rather than showing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and evocative imagery (e.g., "silver nerves carrying thought"). The rhythm supports the pacing well, with no significant scaffold or loop artifacts disrupting the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of an emotional-transit gondola is imaginative and visually distinct. However, the narrative shape—the magical healer smoothing away pain with light and sound—is a familiar trope that isn't subverted or complicated here.</comment>
