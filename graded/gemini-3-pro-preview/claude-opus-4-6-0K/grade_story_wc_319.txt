<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "feral theorem" concept brilliantly grounds intellectual interiority in physical desperation, creating a unique persona. The choice to stay is earned by her deep-seated identity as the "perimeter," giving the renunciation weight and credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant example of Earned Stasis; the choice to remain has a palpable cost in continued exile. The narrative arc moves cleanly from established stasis to disruption (the pendant) and settles into a reconfigured, charged equilibrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "wrong angles" and "formless two" dimensions of light create a specific, sensory constraint that elevates the standard frozen garden setting. The environment actively pressures the protagonist's sense of belonging and motivates the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pendant introduces immediate, high-stakes pressure (the possibility of home) that tests the protagonist's resolve. The renunciation is active and costly, foreclosing a tangible path to relief in favor of a harder, internal truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of inhabiting uncertainty is powerful, though the explicit definition of this realization ("To make friends with uncertainty was...") tells the insight rather than fully dramatizing it. The final image of the pendant as a "second moon" resonates strongly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent "foggy lucidity," balancing poetic abstraction with sensory grit ("blackened with old ink"). The narrative distance is perfectly calibrated to the "feral theorem" persona, making the abstract homesickness feel visceral.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("feral the way a theorem is"), though brief moments of exposition ("Waiting was her primary technology") slow the momentum slightly. Imagery is precise, avoiding loops and serving the "geometry" motif well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the "library guardian" is a familiar trope, the "dimensional homesickness" based on light geometry offers a genuinely fresh synthesis. The transformation of "waiting" into an active technology elevates the premise beyond the standard archetype.</comment>
