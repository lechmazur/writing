<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is distinct, grounding the magical premise in a legible trauma response ("building walls"). The shift from avoidance to acceptance is motivated by the tactile discovery, though the emotional transition during the "months" of translation feels slightly compressed, resolving deep grief a bit smoothly. The final stance is a clear, earned reconfiguration of her identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a defensive stasis to a resonant reconfiguration (RR) at closure. However, the middle section ("It took months") relies on summary to bridge the gap between discovery and mastery, bypassing the specific struggle of the translation process. The ending lands firmly on a specific image that recontextualizes the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the mountain as a linguistic structure is a vivid, constraining environment that shapes the protagonist's journey. Sensory details are precise—the taste of iron, the tactile grain of the stone—and the atmosphere effectively mirrors Maren’s internal hollowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The internal stakes are well-defined (safety vs. truth), and the reversal of the "dread" into "resonance" provides a satisfying thematic deepen. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or specific obstacles during the translation phase; the breakthrough comes via persistence rather than a forced choice against resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis of memory, architecture, and time is exceptional. The central metaphor—reading time like the grain of a feather—unifies the magic system with the emotional arc beautifully. The ending offers a resonant answer to the premise of "lost home" without resorting to a moralizing summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a melancholic but precise tone that suits the "archivist" perspective. The perceptual signature is consistent, focusing on textures and structural metaphors. The shift to a hopeful register at the end feels earned by the preceding voice work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("forests with grammar for roots"), with strong rhythm and imagery. The "months" summary is the only significant weak point, trading scenic immediacy for narrative speed. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished, avoiding loops or generic scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of "home as a shape" and the inversion of foresight into hindsight via tactile grain offers a fresh take on the magical library trope. The synthesis of the "mercury-glass" eye with the architectural setting creates a unique, specific mythology.</comment>
