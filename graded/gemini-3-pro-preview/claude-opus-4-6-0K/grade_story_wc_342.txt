<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s voice is distinct, but the mid-scene reflection on prosopagnosia ("doctors called it") feels expository and halts momentum. The pivotal internal choice—accepting her limits—occurs retrospectively before the scene begins, reducing on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from arrival to the decisive act of placement. While the backstory block slows the middle, the ending lands a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, successfully recontextualizing her "failure" as grace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "living wood" library is exceptional, with details like shelves "curving inward like the chambers of a nautilus" constraining the action and mirroring the fractal theme. The setting actively shapes the final image of the sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (memorializing art before destruction), but the escalation is mild because Maren arrives with her decision already made. The scene is an execution of a plan rather than a high-pressure navigation of choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fractal motif elegantly binds the setting, the coin, and the protagonist's internal arc ("precision" vs. "recognition"). The resolution—finding peace at the limit of one's hands—resonates without stating a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tone is consistently hushed and reverent, fitting the "funeral" context. The POV is stable, though the clinical explanation of her condition slightly distances the reader from the otherwise poetic interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("air holds itself in a room where someone has just stopped speaking"). Imagery is precise and supports the theme, avoiding loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind artist, a fractal-based ancient coin, and a condemned tree-library is highly original. The resulting "book safe" acting as a tomb for a cloud drawing is a fresh, specific concept.</comment>
