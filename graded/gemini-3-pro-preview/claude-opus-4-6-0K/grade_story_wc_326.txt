<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is drawn with distinct, embodied interiority; the pulse-counting quirk effectively grounds her anxiety. However, the scene lacks a high-stakes internal conflict or contradictory impulse; her goal is singular and her path to it is linear competence. The reunion with the "ghost" touches on emotion, but Maren does not have to make a difficult choice or trade-off to succeed, limiting the dramatic depth of her character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure is legible as a Decisive Change (retrieving the proof), but the resolution relies heavily on convenient backstory foresight (the mother predicting this exact absurdity). The ending feels like a "key-in-lock" solution where the protagonist simply finds the perfect tool waiting for her, rather than synthesizing a solution with visible on-page cost or ingenuity. The lack of a complicating reversal flattens the causal tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmospheric work is excellent, blending the sterility of the snow with the "mineral iridescence" of the dome and the organic decay of the ink. The setting feels tactile and hostile, actively isolating the protagonist. The "pale blister" and "dendrites" imagery successfully mirrors the internal themes of sickness and nervous systems, integrating the environment tightly with the concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation is primarily procedural—starting a generator, running code, waiting—rather than dramatic. While the stakes (erasure of existence) are high, they are established early and do not intensify within the scene; the defragmentation process meets no significant resistance or unexpected failure. The protagonist faces no moment where she must sacrifice something or pivot tactics, resulting in a victory that feels earned by labor but not by narrative struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming value from failure is poignant and lands clearly at the end. However, the execution is occasionally on-the-nose, particularly the explicit explanation of the Cygnus constellation ("represented transformation through suffering"). The resonance relies more on stated backstory than on an emergent property of the scene’s action, though the final image of the heartbeat against the silence is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, precise, and well-suited to Maren's analytical, anxious mindset. The pacing moves confidently between technical details and lyrical observation without jarring shifts. The third-person limited perspective is strictly maintained, filtering the environment through Maren's specific preoccupation with survival and biology.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose quality is high, with strong information density and vivid, specific imagery ("dendrites of a nervous system," "pale blister"). The rhythm supports the tension, particularly in the heartbeat-counting motifs. The writing is polished and immediate, avoiding scaffold and engaging the senses effectively throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a "legally dead" person seeking digital resurrection is a fresh twist on the bureaucratic horror genre. Combining this with the "AI ghost" trope creates a unique emotional texture. While the plot mechanics (finding the hidden file) are standard, the specific synthesis of elements and the stark, snowy setting elevate the concept above typical fare.</comment>
