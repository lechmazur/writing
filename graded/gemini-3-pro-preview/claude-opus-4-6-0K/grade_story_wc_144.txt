<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by high competence without internal conflict or flaws, reducing the narrative to a procedural vignette. Her blindness functions as a convenient intuition rather than a constraint that forces difficult trade-offs. The interaction with the captain is transactional and lacks relational pressure or subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The arc is linear and low-stakes, resolving in symmetric satisfaction where the problem is fixed without visible cost or sacrifice. The ending relies on a routine success that returns the world to stasis rather than reconfiguring the protagonist's stance or offering a Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is excellently utilized; the fountain and mist are not merely atmospheric but mechanically essential to the protagonist's solution. Sensory details are specific and firmly grounded in the POV’s tactile and auditory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pressure is nominal; the protagonist faces no genuine obstacles or reversals, solving the central problem with established expertise immediately upon diagnosis. The potential stakes (ship sailing blind) are stated but never visceral, resulting in a lack of narrative torque or escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of mending is coherent but resolved with an explicit summary line ("every departure begins with something mended") that flattens resonance. The ending tells the reader how to feel rather than allowing the image to carry the weight of the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical, matching the requested tone effectively. Perception is strictly and effectively filtered through the protagonist’s non-visual senses, maintaining a strong POV signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and sensory-rich, with high clarity and good information density. A few phrases lean on familiar constructions ("old friends," "physician listens"), but the technical descriptions are precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a blind artisan with supernatural intuition is a familiar trope that plays out safely here without subversion. However, the specific mechanism of translating light refraction into vibration is a clever, grounded invention that adds freshness.</comment>
