<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s internal landscape is vivid, and her specific intellectual approach (quantifying grief) drives every micro-choice in the scene. The arc from seeking a solution to accepting a practice is earned via the ritual, with the cost of her mother's continued absence felt keenly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a precise Accumulative design, building textural pressure through the ritual variables to a distinct Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands effectively, reweighting the goal from a binary "answer" to an ongoing "practice" without breaking the established drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific properties of the cavern (bioluminescence, silence, limestone) act as constraints that shape the ritual. The physical transformation of the mosaic (roses to orbits) perfectly mirrors the internal thematic shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Internal pressure is strong, generated by the friction between the chaos of "ambiguous loss" and Maren's need for mathematical order. While the conflict is entirely internal, the escalation through the ritual steps provides sufficient structural tension for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme is explored through the specific, organic metaphor of the equation rather than abstract exposition. The ending achieves deep resonance by reframing grief as a "luminous" uncertainty, avoiding tidy moralizing while offering a distinct perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and confident, successfully blending mathematical lexicon with organic imagery ("converged," "variables," "threading"). The narrative distance remains intimate and controlled, suiting the solitary and secretive nature of the protagonist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense with imagery; lines like "roots threading through limestone like veins" are excellent. A slight deduction for the phrase "copper and wonder," where the abstract noun dilutes the sensory precision of the copper taste.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical logic, folk magic, and grief in a subterranean orchard feels fresh and specific. The concept of using a chipped mosaic as a Rosetta Stone for emotion is a genuinely ingenious touch that anchors the story's magical realism.</comment>
