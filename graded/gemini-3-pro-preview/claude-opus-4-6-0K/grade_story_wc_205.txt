<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s transition from revolutionary to elegist is drawn with exceptional precision, grounding the high-concept premise in a specific, lived emotional trajectory. The choice to leave the mirror covered at the end serves as a potent, character-specific micro-action that dramatizes her shift from ego/present validation to witnessing the past. Her internal landscape is coherent, linking her political history to her archaeological obsession without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure perfectly aligns with the accumulative/textural drive lens, using the approaching storm to build pressure that resolves in a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance. The closure—a renunciation of the Academic Council’s validation in favor of private communion—lands with legible cost and thematic weight. The causality of the light-physics and the mirror ritual is tightly woven into the scene's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the specific physics of "time-light" and the baroque geology directly constrain the protagonist’s actions (the mirror ritual). The sensory details—amber currents, spirals, dark fabric—create a cohesive atmosphere that supports the tone of "burnished sorrow." The environment actively participates in the climax by providing the medium for the revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The internal conflict between the need for external revolution/validation and the need for internal peace/witnessing is deepened effectively through the scene. While the external antagonist (the Council) is distant, the immediate pressure of the storm and the fragile nature of the projection creates sufficient stakes. The resolution earns its quiet power by foreclosing the path of seeking public vindication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "creation persisting without creators" resonates powerfully through the specific imagery of the shard and the poem, avoiding abstract moralizing. The parallel between the defunct revolutionary and the extinct civilization is handled with sophistication, allowing the subtext to emerge organically. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of what matters when a cause (or a species) is lost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly controlled, perfectly suiting a protagonist who thinks in iambic pentameter. The shift between technical observation and poetic elegy is seamless, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature throughout. The distance is managed expertly, keeping us close to Maren’s internal state while establishing the strange physics of the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control that mirrors the story’s baroque aesthetic. Phrasing like "braiding together like the hair of some ancient god" risks being slightly ornamental, but fits the established voice. The technical descriptions of the shard’s geometry blend smoothly with the emotional weight of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a hard sci-fi setting (asteroid mining, light physics) with a metaphysical, almost magical-realist mechanic (visible time) is fresh and memorable. The character archetype of the "defunct revolutionary" applied to xeno-archaeology offers a unique emotional angle on a familiar trope. The story commits fully to its specific, melancholic vision without hedging.</comment>
