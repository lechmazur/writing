<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose internal state ("curiosity was the only compass") drives the plot naturally. Her physical reaction to the climax—shaking hands—effectively embodies the emotional cost of the protocol breach, though the decision itself feels slightly inevitable rather than a difficult trade-off in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and structurally sound, moving cleanly from routine to crisis to resolution. The closure (saving the child and returning to the board) lands with a clear sense of earned stasis, though the flash-forward to the Bureau's future review ("later, when they reviewed her logs") slightly deflates the immediate tension of the protocol break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with "mist-clad" glass and "green silence" creating a vivid, pressurized environment that enhances the supernatural elements. The conservatory functions not just as a backdrop but as a resonant amplifier for the story's tone, grounding the magical mechanics in organic detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from a routine trace to a life-or-death intervention involving a child. While the pressure is coherent, the resolution—speaking into the void and achieving an almost instant sync—feels slightly too frictionless; the antagonist force (the dead signal) yields without a final escalation of resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "vulnerable voices" versus digital efficiency is woven smartly into the hearing aid mechanic. The concept of "incidental heroism" lands well at the end, recontextualizing her curiosity as a protective force without descending into heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the melancholic atmosphere. The POV stays firmly with Maren, filtering the world through her specific expertise and empathy without lapses in distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and precise, with high information density and strong rhythm ("bruised hour," "condensation wept"). The imagery is fresh and serves the story's mood without tipping into purple prose; line-level execution is publish-ready.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of "contact tracers for hearts" is a genuinely fresh synthesis of pandemic-era terminology and ghost story tropes. The specific mechanics—using analog tech to catch frequencies the dead use—adds a layer of ingenuity that elevates the concept above standard urban fantasy fare.</comment>
