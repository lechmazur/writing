<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Harmon is a consistent, mythic figure, but the reliance on narrative summary robs him of a specific "crucible" moment. He lacks internal contradiction or a dramatized micro-choice under pressure; his success is procedural rather than psychological.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story operates as a timeline montage ("for thirty years," "every evening," "by autumn") rather than a continuous scene, violating short-form scope defaults. While the closure is legible, the lack of immediate scenic pressure dilutes the cost and causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, acting as both resource and antagonist. Sensory details like "light the color of bruised fruit" and "tongues so old they tasted like iron" are vivid, specific, and functionally grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conflict is Man vs. Soil, resolved procedurally through competence over time. There is no sharp escalation, active opposition, or moment where failure feels imminent in a specific scene; the stakes are high in concept but low in dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "submerged concords" is beautifully woven into the mechanics of the story. The resonance is strong, though the narration occasionally explicitly explains the theme ("believing that smallness and enormity were the same thing") rather than letting it live solely in subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, confident, and perfectly calibrated to the fable-like tone. Narrative distance is controlled, moving smoothly from the broad scope of history to the intimacy of a seed pod.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional—dense, rhythmic, and purposeful. Sentences do double duty, advancing narrative and atmosphere simultaneously without scaffold or clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics, ornithology, and wasteland restoration is fresh and highly specific. The concept of "waking pacts" via dead languages offers a unique, non-obvious angle on environmental renewal.</comment>
