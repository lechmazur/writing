<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s motivation is compelling, rooted in a specific, high-concept profession and personal loss. However, her primary attribute ("sensitively perceptive") is delivered via diagnostic summary rather than dramatized through friction or specific difficulty in the moment. The internal conflict is clear, but the emotional cost is explained more than felt until the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, leading to a legible Decisive Change where Maren accepts the cost of obsession. The discovery sequence relies on the convenient trope of unburned diaries in a fireplace, which slightly weakens the causal chain, but the closure lands with genuine weight under a consistent hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with exceptional sensory specificity, particularly the acoustic details ("compression of silence," "layered whispers") which ground the sci-fi concept in physical reality. The environment actively shapes Maren's perception and pacing. A slight deduction only for the standard "ivy-covered ruin" visual tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Internal pressure escalates effectively as the discovery of the negatives reweights the stakes from mere mapping to existential choice. The cost of the final decision—isolation and shared madness—is legible and felt. The external conflict is largely static, serving as a backdrop for the internal turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central conceit of walls "dreaming" offers deep resonance, but the subtext is flattened by an explicit thematic summary ("The burden of legacy was not that it demanded continuation..."). This narratorial intrusion explains the meaning rather than letting the final image carry the weight alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is atmospheric and controlled, perfectly matching the melancholic, scholarly tone of the protagonist. The "corridor echo cartographer" terminology feels lived-in and distinct. Narrative distance is stable, zooming in effectively during the examination of the negatives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and high information density. However, the phrase "sensitively perceptive" is a weak, redundant modifier pair that acts as a tell. Occasional abstract metaphors ("frequency just below grief") border on purple but fit the genre's style.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core concept of "acoustic cartography" as a way to read architectural memory is highly original and imaginatively executed. It transforms the familiar "abandoned ruin" trope into something fresh and intellectually stimulating. The specific synthesis of sound, neuroscience, and architecture is excellent.</comment>
