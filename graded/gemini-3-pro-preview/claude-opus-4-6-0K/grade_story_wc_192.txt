<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's internal landscape is vivid, with the backstory of "tourniquet" affection sharply defining her motivation for isolation. The shift from recluse to mentor is earned through the specific, shared language of the scars, though the bond forms rapidly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A clean, resonant arc where the arrival of the girl acts as a precise catalyst for a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure—Maren turning the ring and imagining a door to open—effectively reweights her stance on connection with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary is exceptional, functioning as both setting and central metaphor; the "absent roof" allows the thematic resolution of learning to breathe. Sensory details like the clicking iron and settling ash are tactile and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (suffocation vs. breath) is signaled early and effectively tightened by the girl's admission. The pressure is coherent, forcing Maren to confront the limits of her curated emptiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "ruin as space" is handled with sophistication, avoiding simple binaries. The "negotiations" of self-harm offer a nuanced take on pain, though the final dialogue line leans slightly into a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is assured and lyrical, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that mirrors Maren's initial guardedness. The modulation of tone as the emptiness "grows warm" is handled with control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic ("affection became a tourniquet," "broken fingers"). Minor redundancy in "ashen charcoal" (tautology) prevents a higher score, but the imagery is otherwise striking and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the burned church setting with the specific trauma of "suffocating love" feels fresh. While the "shared scars" trope is familiar, framing them as "negotiations" rather than wounds adds a distinct layer of ingenuity.</comment>
