<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vael's desire is clear, but the emotional trajectory is frictionless; she moves from isolation to connection without significant internal resistance or behavioral fallibility. The "boldly sympathetic" attribute feels inserted as a thought label rather than demonstrated through difficult action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist gets exactly what she wants with minimal cost. The closure is a happy reconfiguration lacking the "felt cost" required for higher bands; the obstacle dissolves upon contact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the "obsidian arbor" and "crystalline orchard" actively shaping the light and the artwork. The sensory details ("glass-bright silence," "violet and molten gold") effectively establish a distinct atmosphere that supports the thematic metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conflict is the story's weakest element; the tension is theoretical (fear of rejection) but never actualized in scene, as Korin is immediately accepting. There is no escalation of pressure; the "tightening" of the arrival leads instantly to relief rather than a difficult trade-off or deepening dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of chosen kinship is coherent but articulated through explicit dialogue ("Tolerance is not kinship") rather than emerging solely from subtext. The ending image of the lamp is resonant, but the reliance on direct thematic statements limits the interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, fitting the "crystalline" aesthetic well without slipping into head-hopping. The narrative distance is maintained effectively, though the emotional articulation sometimes leans into poetic abstraction rather than grounded interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("rib cage... reaching hand"), though it occasionally tilts toward overwriting ("hurt the chest more than the eyes"). No major artifacts, though the insertion of prompt phrases is slightly visible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of the fantastical setting (marsh/crystal) with the street-art-tag plot offers a fresh aesthetic on the "found family" trope. While the emotional arc is standard, the specific synthesis of reed sculpting and obsidian light provides a memorable textural quality.</comment>
