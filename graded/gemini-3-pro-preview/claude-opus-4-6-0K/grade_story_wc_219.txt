<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sera’s interiority is defined by a compelling contradiction—the "luminous skeptic" who feels deeply but intellectualizes it as chemistry. The shift from clinical observer to believer is earned through the pressure of the scene, and her internal conflict is embodied in the physiological monitoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative drive is strong, with a clear inciting incident and a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's worldview. The "footprints" beat—implying she scouted the path in a fugue state an hour prior—strains credibility slightly against her hyper-competent "controlled variables" persona, but the thematic payoff holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the emotional arc; the "rainwashed" tower and the "bronze quiet" create a distinct atmosphere. The fly amber is an exceptional micro-setting that anchors the theme of preservation across time, charging the final image with necessary weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal but rigorously dramatized: her intellect vs. her physiology. The escalation of her cortisol levels serves as a tangible metric for the stakes, forcing her to confront the inadequacy of her reductive hypothesis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically, weaving the cosmic scale of the signal with the intimate scale of the amber and grief. The resolution—that understanding the mechanism doesn't diminish the meaning—is a profound, earned insight that avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending academic precision ("cortisol," "spatial memory") with lyrical sensitivity ("luminous skeptic," "artificial pilgrimage"). The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering the world through Sera’s specific intellectual lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high momentum; images like "the building had been crying carefully" are striking. There are no visible loops or artifacts, and the rhythm supports the contemplative intensity of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of a nostalgia researcher confronting first contact through the lens of localized grief is a fresh, specific synthesis. It avoids the common tropes of sci-fi spectacularism in favor of deep, character-driven inquiry.</comment>
