<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sael is a compelling focalizer whose professional competence drives the narrative choices. Her "strange honesty" is dramatized effectively in the interaction with the pilgrim, grounding abstract philosophy in character traits. The internal conflict between reception and filtration is visceral and embodied through the mask mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving from disruption to a tangible, mechanic-driven resolution via the kinetic parapet. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned; the compromise between new revelation and old wisdom is physically enacted on the page, not just debated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is treated as a physical force that constrains and enables the protagonist's choices. The description of sound as "pollen" or "sediment" provides a consistent, vivid sensory logic that grounds the magical elements in concrete experience, satisfying the high-band requirement for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes—erasure of history—are clearly established and escalated by the prophet's growing influence. While the personal cost is primarily exertion and vigilance, the conceptual cost of permanently altering the archive to survive is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The exploration of memory versus revelation is sophisticated and nuanced. However, the final paragraph explicitly articulates the thesis ("Wisdom... was the space"), which triggers the deduction for explicit moralizing and flattens the resonance of the preceding imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is disciplined and authoritative, perfectly matching the protagonist's role as a line walker. The shift from internal technical focus to the brief, guarded dialogue with the pilgrim demonstrates excellent control of narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic, utilizing metaphors of physical matter to describe sound without confusion. The line-level craft supports the story's ethereal tone while maintaining narrative momentum, with no visible artifacts or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic physics, architecture, and religious allegory creates a genuinely fresh concept. The "kinetic parapet" as a tool for preserving sound is an inventive and memorable element that elevates the premise beyond standard fantasy tropes.</comment>
