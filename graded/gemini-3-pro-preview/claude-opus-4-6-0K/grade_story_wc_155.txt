<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Internal grief is vivid ("pressing the number like a bruise"), establishing a strong baseline. The pivotal shift to joy feels slightly rapid, relying on a metaphor ("something unlock") rather than a dramatized struggle or trade-off, but the emotional logic holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A clean, linear arc with excellent orientation and closure. The "stumble" works effectively as an inciting incident, and the final image (resetting the counter) offers a resonant reconfiguration of the opening hook.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional; the "calcified stumps" and "exposed film" murals create a unique, tactile environment. The setting is not just backdrop but active memory that constrains and triggers the protagonist's internal change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the resolution comes with relatively low resistance; the weight of seven months of grief dissolves quickly upon finding the object. A distinct sense of cost or what must be left behind to laugh again would heighten the impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory and light cohere well, though the text occasionally explains its symbols explicitly ("fog was... memory made visible") rather than letting them resonate subtextually. The ending lands the theme effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical voice matches the magical realism tone. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Luma’s perception while managing the exposition of her artistic technique smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density and strong imagery ("broken teeth," "breathing amber"). The phrase "knowledge network" feels slightly jargon-heavy for the established poetic register, but the rhythmic repetition in the memory sequence works well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "exposed film" mural technique—capturing light over time—is a genuinely fresh concept that elevates a familiar narrative of grief and rediscovery. The synthesis of medium and memory feels specific and original.</comment>
