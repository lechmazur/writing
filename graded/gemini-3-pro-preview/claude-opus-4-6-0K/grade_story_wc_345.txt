<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on summary and archetype ("altruistic ghost," "leader") rather than dramatized complexity. The protagonists, Pascal and Tuva, lack internal conflict or agency; they function as passive executants of the ghost's instructions rather than active agents making difficult choices with visible costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a timeline summary of three years rather than a scenic story with immediate pressure; the "now" of the story is vague until the very end. Closure ("WELL DONE") is a validation of obedience rather than a result of a costly decision or reconfiguration, lacking the required narrative tension for high-band placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific imagery ("lavender sky," "floating rock arches") that effectively establishes atmosphere. However, the description often leans on "soft sci-fi" visual tropes (gravity as a suggestion) rather than tactile, constraint-driven environmental details that force character adaptation in real-time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Conflict is entirely external (survival) and resolved by an external force (the ghost's instructions) rather than protagonist agency. There is no escalation of difficult choices; the characters merely obey a trusted authority, removing the friction and risk required for genuine dramatic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The themes of stewardship and communal grief are coherent but delivered with a sentimental, fable-like simplicity that lacks subtextual depth. The "Brambled hope" concept and the final message ("WELL DONE") resolve the narrative too tidily, avoiding the moral complexity or ambiguity usually found in top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The collective/omniscient voice is consistent and successfully evokes a mythic, oral-history tone suitable for a fable. While functional, the distance inherent in this POV prevents deep emotional resonance with any specific character, keeping the reader at arm's length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally relies on clichéd formulations ("gravity... was a suggestion," "sugar in rain") and "telling" summaries. The density of information is low due to the overview structure, though the line-level craft is generally competent and free of jarring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise of a benevolent ghost guiding a colony is a familiar trope executed here without significant subversion or fresh specificity. The story plays it safe with a heartwarming resolution that lacks the bite or unexpected synthesis required for high originality scores.</comment>
