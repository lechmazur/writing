<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable’s internal state is rendered with exceptional precision; the shift from fevered avoidance to clarity is embodied in the "post-fever eyes" looking at the smudge. The motivation to "calibrate" her emotional state against the oracle’s logic is a unique, character-specific driver that justifies the introspection. Her acceptance of "fault tolerance" as a model for human love is a profound, earned evolution of her worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from the physical fever break to the conceptual "break" of the thermal inversion metaphor. The oracle’s answer functions as a high-impact Conceptual Repricing (CR), instantly converting the abstract weight of silence into the concrete danger of stagnant air, forcing the decision to descend.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the isolation allows the "old snow" and "wind instruments" to act as the only other characters. The "frost on the corner" and the specific botanical detail (Gentiana algida) ground the speculative oracle in a tactile reality that mirrors the protagonist's fragile state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are internal but feel massive due to the thermal inversion metaphor, which creates a "breathless" pressure on the page. The conflict between the desire for precision and the necessity of "fault tolerance" escalates clearly, resolving not by solving the lie, but by changing Sable's tolerance for it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The thematic integration of mechanical "fault tolerance" with human forgiveness is masterfully executed. The story avoids moralizing; instead, it uses the station's logic to reach a resonant conclusion that "survival was not the same as restoration," perfectly distinguishing between fixing a relationship and merely keeping it functioning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined consistency, filtering all emotional realization through the lexicon of meteorology ("pressure differential," "calibration"). This distinct perceptual signature ensures that even the flashback to the inheritance feels like a data reading rather than an exposition dump.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with standout images like "breath frozen on paper" and "occupying margins the way lichen occupies stone." The rhythm controls the pacing well, though the phrase "sorrow of all dawns" leans slightly toward abstraction compared to the concrete sharpness of the rest.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The concept of a "fault-tolerant oracle" that offers continuity rather than truth is a brilliant, fresh take on the divination trope. Combining this with a mountaineering survival narrative creates a unique synthesis that feels inevitable rather than forced.</comment>
