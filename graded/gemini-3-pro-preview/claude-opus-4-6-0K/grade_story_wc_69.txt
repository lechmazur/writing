<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marguerite’s motivation ("braid diverse voices") is actively dramatized through her unique pedagogy. The "brothers from Donegal" shard provides a potent, compressed emotional arc that earns the story's climax through a single shared look, effectively grounding the collective "unlearning."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens functions perfectly, building from the gathered silence to the release of the hymn. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the brothers' connection and the final image of the leaf, paying off the "vanishing" theme with a felt, resonant cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "velvet library" is not just backdrop but a constraint; its "accidental and perfect" acoustics dictate the choir's existence and method. The zither rosette functions as a micro-setting element that physically embodies the theme of fragile, patient beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but high: the preservation of human connection against the erasure of time ("vanishing art"). The tension is successfully located in the singers' bodies, and the release—via the brothers' eye contact—is a genuine earned turn under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "vanishing arts" is inextricably linked to the plot (the rehearsal) and the central symbol (the rosette). The ending refuses a tidy moral, instead offering a resonant image ("falling was not the same as being lost") that reweights the fear of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical elevation that suits the "sacred" atmosphere of the library. Transitions between Marguerite’s interiority and the collective experience of the choir are smooth and authoritative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("slant of October light... turned the burgundy curtains to embers"). Sentence rhythm mirrors the musical subject matter, and there is zero scaffold or synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While the "healing power of music" is a familiar trope, the specific framing of "subtracting noise" and the "vanishing art" context gives it a fresh, specific intellectual weight. The execution elevates the premise significantly.</comment>
