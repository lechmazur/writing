<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character interiority is exceptionally rendered through the specific constraint of the proprioceptive enhancement, merging sci-fi concepts with trauma psychology seamlessly. The shift from involuntary bracing to the calculated measurement of "two degrees" earns the emotional arc through concrete, embodied detail that feels specific to Sera.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a precise accumulative lens where the protagonist actively tests her trauma response, leading to a closure unit of Resonant Reconfiguration. The "two degrees" measurement offers a specific, quantitative victory that validates the "asymptotic" thematic drive without creating false resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting actively mirrors the protagonist’s internal state; the "ultraviolet penance" and "beauty made entirely from damage" elevate the forest from backdrop to thematic partner. The environment constrains the protagonist's attention and validates her perception of the world as a place of altered/contaminated beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s active agency to trigger her own trauma response (touching the strap) to measure the result. The cost is visceral and immediately felt in the physical seizing of the muscles, creating high tension within a quiet, internal scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of measuring recovery is explored with sophistication; the "mathematics of mercy" concept anchors abstract healing in concrete physical degrees. The ending resists a tidy cure, settling instead for a resonant, asymptotic improvement that feels intellectually and emotionally honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice perfectly embodies the protagonist's enhanced condition, utilizing clinical, coordinate-based language to describe internal feeling. The distance is controlled masterfully, merging the scientific with the emotional to create a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly specific, with high-impact phrasing ("proprioceptive enhancement," "ultraviolet penance") that serves the story's logic. The line-level execution creates a distinct texture without scaffold or loops, supporting the "precise" nature of the protagonist's mind.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of proprioceptive enhancement as a burden of hyper-awareness rather than a superpower is a fresh, specific subversion of tropes. The synthesis of this sci-fi element with a rigorous, mathematical approach to trauma rehabilitation creates a unique and memorable emotional landscape.</comment>
