<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is a clearly drawn, obsessed artist whose internal state matches the gothic atmosphere. His motivation is distinct (decoding the damage), though the lack of on-page hesitation or contradictory impulses lowers the dramatic tension of the choice; his compliance with the "ghost" feels somewhat inevitable rather than a hard-won decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent under a Situational lens, moving from investigation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the environment shifts in response to the music. The causality of the ghost/water logic holds within the story's rules, and the closure (the baton lowering) is a strong, concrete image of resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both antagonist and collaborator; the water is not just scenery but the agent of the composition (watermarks) and the judge of the performance. The flooded orchestra pit provides a unique, constraining physicality that charges the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and atmospheric, escalating as the building "flinched" and the water stains moved. However, the stakes remain largely abstract and aesthetic—appeasing a spirit—without a tangible, high-cost alternative or risk to Marcus beyond general safety, limiting the visceral impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of art surviving in "in-between" spaces is woven well through the imagery of the pit and the watermarks. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes this theme ("understanding that some music exists only..."), triggering the penalty for moralizing/explaining the resonance rather than letting the final image speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent reverent and slightly eerie tone that suits the subject matter. The focus remains tightly anchored in Marcus's artistic perception, translating physical damage into musical potential without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("restless copper waves," "cathedral and a shipwreck") with strong rhythmic control. The polysyndeton in the climax ("lanterns swayed and the water held still...") works well to build momentum. No significant artifacts or loops were detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a flood narrative with musical notation—specifically water damage acting as a score—is a fresh and inventive take on the "ghostly unfinished symphony" trope. The specific execution elevates a familiar premise into something distinct.</comment>
