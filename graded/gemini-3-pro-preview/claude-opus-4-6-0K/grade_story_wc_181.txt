<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s specific background as a curator motivates the resolution (choosing to "tend" rather than "keep"), turning a job title into a thematic key. Her internal progression from bewilderment to acceptance is charted clearly through her interaction with the cameo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the bathroom breakthrough effectively as a pivot point for the climax. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts the burden of the lineage with a clear shift in stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "small green skulls" and "stone palms" vividly ground the surreal premise. The orchard feels "impossibly present," effectively using the environment to pressure the protagonist's realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal—understanding vs. overwhelming legacy—but the "forbidden knowledge" adds necessary texture. The cost is subtle but felt: the surrender of possession in exchange for the servitude of tending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The distinction between possessing and tending offers a sophisticated take on inheritance. The final image of the composite portrait successfully reweights the concept of ownership into one of nonlinear participation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a poised, lyrical control that prevents the whimsical elements (asteroid orchard, outhouse epiphany) from feeling farcical. The transition from the mundane to the revelation is handled with consistent tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic; "democracy of a locked door" is an excellent line that elevates the potentially awkward bathroom prompt. Minor cliché in "luminous and terrible," but overall density is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a space-based setting with a 19th-century style inheritance mystery is highly original. The concept of the "nonlinear inheritance" is executed with fresh, specific imagery rather than generic tropes.</comment>
