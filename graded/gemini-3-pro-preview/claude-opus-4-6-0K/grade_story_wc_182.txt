<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sable is a competent and distinct protagonist, but she functions primarily as a facilitator for Maren’s arc; while her empathy is clear, she lacks a deeply embodied personal stake or cost that would elevate the emotional resonance beyond the role of a witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is structured well with a clever deductive turn (using the diary as a topographical map), though the climax—persuading the Custodial Silence—resolves with atmospheric ease rather than the friction of a hard-won victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thornspire is a vividly realized setting, grounded by specific details like the "living document" catalog and "acoustic fossils"; the environment actively shapes the investigation method and the narrative tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conceptual stakes are high (saving human wisdom), but the conflict is largely intellectual; the obstacle of the Custodial Silence yields to argument without exacting a concrete price from the protagonist, limiting the sense of peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "rescue as frequency" offers a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure; the metaphor of the "unheard symphony" elegantly reframes the central conflict from force to attention without descending into heavy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, managing the transition from summary to scene smoothly; the "proto-Enochian" and linguistic details enrich the POV’s specific expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with standout lines like "a negative shape, like a missing tooth the tongue keeps finding"; minor didacticism in the list of lessons is outweighed by the strength of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of time travel, botany, and linguistics creates a fresh narrative texture; the concept of a botanical diary functioning as an altitudinal map is a particularly ingenious invention.</comment>
