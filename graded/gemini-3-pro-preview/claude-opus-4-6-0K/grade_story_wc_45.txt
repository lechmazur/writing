<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Maren is a superbly realized protagonist whose internal contradiction—doubting miracles but forgiving believers—creates immediate depth. Her transition from skeptic to believer is earned not through plot convenience but through the specific, traumatized logic of her grief and trade. The "bone-setting" worldview provides a unique, character-specific lens for processing the supernatural.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and causally tight, moving from the inciting discovery to the conceptual breakthrough in the garden. The closure is a "Charged Poise" that reconfigures the protagonist's reality with visible cost (surrendering certainty). The transition into the maze is slightly compressed ("passage took an hour"), but the structural integrity remains high.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are evocative and precise, particularly the "honey and chalk" scent and the tactile "wrongness" of the changeling tooth. The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant that challenges Maren's rational understanding. The contrast between the clinical village and the impossible garden is handled with deft economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are deeply personal and clearly escalated; the external search for the child mirrors the internal search for redemption. The pressure tightens effectively when the physical evidence (the tooth) forces Maren to abandon her safe skepticism. The cost of admission—the fracture of her world's logic—is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of "setting" fractured reality like a broken bone is masterfully integrated, elevating the story above a standard changeling tale. The theme of healing through faith emerges organically from the protagonist’s specific skill set. The ending resonates powerfully, turning a physical trade into a metaphysical resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Maren’s tactile, diagnostic perspective. The tone balances the folkloric atmosphere with the protagonist’s grounded, practical nature. Narrative distance is managed perfectly, staying close to Maren’s internal processing while maintaining a fable-like authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density and no scaffold. Images like "roots surfaced and dove like the backs of sea creatures" are striking. The final paragraph leans slightly into thematic summary ("She chose to believe it"), but the preceding imagery earns this crystallization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the changeling trope is familiar, filtering the encounter through the specific, tactile lens of a bone-setter offers a fresh and compelling angle. The story avoids the cliché of an immediate physical rescue, opting instead for a more sophisticated internal reconfiguration of belief.</comment>
