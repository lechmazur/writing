<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict (pride vs. longing) is well-drawn and embodied in the "unsent letters." However, the emotional risk of the climax is undercut when the supernatural messages provide forgiveness ("I forgive you anyway") *before* she makes her decisive move, mitigating the cost of her choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (turning the boat to deliver the letters) is legible. The causality relies heavily on the "magical answering machine" mechanic, which solves the central tension externally rather than forcing Lira to act blindly into the silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and specific, acting as a constraint on the action (poling through roots, following sound). Details like "Spanish moss made of sound" and the "gargoyle’s rainspout... dark with age" effectively ground the supernatural elements in sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as relational and internal. The escalation is steady, but the climax lacks "felt cost" because the ghost removes the fear of rejection prior to Lira's final commitment. The tension deflates slightly too early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "healing in the right light" is resonant, though stated explicitly in the text. The final image of the letter in the stone throat successfully externalizes the internal shift without needing a moralizing summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "fierce tenderness" throughout. The prose texture effectively mirrors the humid, dreamlike quality of the swamp without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("fingers of something that had forgotten how to let go"). A few similes border on overwrought ("shattered mirror still reflects but only in pieces"), but the rhythm generally supports the atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mangrove swamp setting with gothic gargoyle imagery creates a fresh, memorable aesthetic. While the "unsent letters" trope is standard, the specific execution via the healing stone elevates it.</comment>
