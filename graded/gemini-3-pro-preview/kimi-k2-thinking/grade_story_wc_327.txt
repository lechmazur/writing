<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a mythic archetype rather than a psychologically grounded character, fitting the fable mode but limiting intimacy. While her motivation is clear, her internal landscape is static; she moves from desire to action without contradictory impulses or hesitation, making her more of a vessel for the concept than a living agent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a convenient arrival of the birds to solve the central problem, followed by a summary-heavy epilogue ("In the years that followed") that narrates the cost rather than dramatizing the transformation in scene. This distance dilutes the immediate impact of the closure, turning a potential resonant reconfiguration into a reported event.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with evocative, textural details like "fossilized thunder" and "polished calcium" that ground the surreal setting. The physical environment actively shapes the narrative logic, though the specific "canyon of endless echoes" concept does the heavy lifting for the plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Escalation is linear and somewhat low-pressure; the obstacle (sensation is not sound) is resolved almost immediately by the coincidental appearance of the spinebirds. The protagonist’s success comes too easily through sudden realization rather than struggle, and the ultimate cost—her death/oxidization—is buffered by the summary narration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "persistence beyond meaning" is poignant and well-integrated into the diamond’s function. However, the narrative tends to explicate these themes directly ("The storyteller knew the curse was not malice but memory") rather than letting them emerge solely through subtext and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone that suits the subject matter. The distance is controlled, though at times it risks becoming too detached, prioritizing lyrical abstraction over immediate sensory immersion in the protagonist's physical decline.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense and often beautiful, but suffers from repetitive phrasing (the attribute "quietly articulate" appears twice as a label). Some descriptions border on purple ("sun that remembered no names"), and the reliance on "And [phrase]" sentence starts creates a slightly monotonous biblical cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis of translating geology into sound via avian flight patterns is highly imaginative and distinct. The concept feels fresh and creates a unique textural experience, elevating the familiar trope of the "dying language" into something strange and new.</comment>
