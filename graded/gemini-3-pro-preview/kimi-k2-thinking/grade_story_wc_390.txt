<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist is competent and active, but the central trait ("logically emotional") is delivered via diagnostic telling rather than dramatized behavior. The internal conflict is stated as a thesis ("duality defined her") rather than felt through a difficult choice or contradictory impulse, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causality is clean and the narrative arc is structurally sound with no major breaks. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) works well, though the solution (humming at 7.8 Hz) feels like a competence-based procedural fix rather than a hard-won victory born of struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively blending the "drift-ice" reality with the "fleshly ethereal" tone. Sensory details like "tasting bronze" and "frozen kelp" ground the mystical elements, though the density of description occasionally slows momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and the protagonist's victory feels largely inevitable due to her specialized knowledge. The cost is somatic ("flesh felt the sound") rather than a meaningful sacrifice or trade-off, keeping the tension in the mid-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily didactic, with the text explicitly explaining the symbolism ("device that turned grief into music") and the character's nature. This over-articulation robs the subtext of its power, leaving little room for reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "fleshly ethereal" prompt well. However, it leans toward the baroque ("crystalline fist," "sorrow's geometry"), which sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical density and adjective stacking ("fleeting golden sunset dripped," "molten coin"). The "logically... emotionally..." parallel structure feels mechanical, and the high concentration of figurative language occasionally obscures the scene's geometry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic engineering and spectral exorcism offers a fresh take on the lighthouse keeper trope. While the plot beats are standard, the specific blending of physics terms (Hertz, resonance) with the supernatural creates a distinct identity.</comment>
