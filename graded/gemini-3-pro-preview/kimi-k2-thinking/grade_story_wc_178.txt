<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael is a consistent focalizer with a clear worldview, but his defining trait of "frugality" feels asserted via labels rather than dramatized through a high-cost choice under pressure. The characterization is competent but lacks the visceral interior contradiction required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the Conceptual Repricing at closure (magic reconfigured as math/pattern) lands clearly. However, the reliance on summary to bridge the "seven nights" and "tenth day" creates a distance that softens the causal tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using specific details like "lapis-inlaid floor" and "Pabilsag" to ground the scene. The physical environment successfully mirrors the intellectual transition between regimes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clear but remain abstract and intellectual; the threat of the "new priests" provides timeline pressure, but Kael faces no immediate, visceral peril or personal sacrifice, resulting in a low-heat conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story explicitly articulates its theme in the final paragraphs ("uncloaking not magic, but a truth," "patterns persist when regimes fall"), converting subtext into text. This on-the-nose explanation diminishes the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately elevated for the setting, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("ghost-scent," "measure infinity"). The tone is consistent, supporting the "scholar amidst ruins" aesthetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the forced insertion of required phrases ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony") creates awkward rhythmic stumbles. The repetition of "dusky harmony" and "frugal/frugality" feels mechanical rather than motivic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy and magic squares is handled competently, though the "magic is actually advanced science" trope is played straight. The concept is solid but the execution stays within safe, expected boundaries.</comment>
