<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is compelling and drives the narrative pressure, anchoring the abstract goal of "witnessing" in visceral physical cost ("closing fists," "primal panic"). The internal conflict between phobia and duty is well-sustained and pays off in the decision to endure the final seven seconds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, utilizing the tidal window as an effective ticking clock to force closure. However, the mechanics of the "phase transition" blur the line between physical drainage and metaphysical state change, creating slight orientation drag regarding the facility's rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is excellent; the "crashing hush" and "bloated" leather codex create a distinct, pressurized sensory environment that feels physically dangerous. The setting actively constraints the protagonist, grounding the sci-fi elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalate effectively with the rising water, forcing a choice between safety and the goal. The climax relies on endurance rather than a complex causal reversal, but the physical and psychological cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of erasure vs. memory is poignant but slightly repetitive, with the phrase "unremembered" appearing four times. The final contrast between the tragedy below and the "cat videos" above effectively reweights the narrative stakes at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical terminology with melancholic introspection in a way that suits the setting. The shift to a broader perspective in the final paragraph is handled well, avoiding a jarring break in tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong but suffers from a high density of figurative language (e.g., "swallowed by the crashing hush," "language... architect") that occasionally obscures clarity. The mix of abstract and concrete metaphors slows momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tracking digital ghosts in undersea cables via an analog codex is creative and feels fresh. While the "phase transition" physics are slightly hand-waved, the core concept provides a unique lens on the haunted-facility trope.</comment>
