<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chaplain's motivation—seeking redemption by proxy—is clear and consistent, anchoring the narrative. However, his epiphany is largely passive, triggered by Marlowe's lecture rather than a high-stakes personal choice or struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a legible Resonant Reconfiguration of the chaplain's purpose. However, the resolution relies on a linear "sage teaches lesson" structure rather than active protagonist agency or causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "vibrant hush" establishes atmosphere, but the description relies on shopworn imagery ("dust motes... tiny galaxy," "silence louder than any scream"). The setting provides mood but does not uniquely constrain the characters' choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are legible but the conflict remains low-pressure and abstract; the tension is resolved by watching a craftsman work rather than through interpersonal conflict. The external storm adds "pathetic fallacy" urgency that isn't inherent in the scene's dynamics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme is consistent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism ("This is how we turn an apology into action"). The ending explicitly explains the metaphor ("The light through storm clouds wasn't just metaphor"), which collapses subtext into a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, reverent tone appropriate for the subject. It occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought phrasing ("matters of forgiveness that his collar couldn't quite unravel") but avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose flows rhythmically but is marred by a high density of clichés ("silence louder than any scream," "precision of a surgeon," "patience of a saint"). These artifacts flatten the imagery and reduce line-level freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story competently executes the "healing repair" trope but adheres strictly to a standard inspirational template. It lacks a subversive angle or specific, gritty detail that would distinguish it from a generic parable.</comment>
