<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("harvest lessons from loss") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional arc feels smoothed over by the ritual, lacking the contradictory impulses or friction required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear ritualistic structure (carving while kettle boils), but the causality is somewhat magical, relying on the "crystallized time" device to force resolution. Closure is distinct but feels mechanically derived from the prompt's magic system.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sensory environment is vivid (ash, rain, steam), but the recurrence of the specific phrase "rust-hued peace" as a descriptive label breaks immersion. The setting successfully anchors the mood but feels slightly checklist-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The conflict is internal (grief vs. peace) but lacks sufficient resistance; the ritual resolves the tension without a palpable cost or difficult choice. The stakes are stated ("harvest lessons") rather than dramatized through risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story explicitly explains its theme to the reader ("She understood that the lesson was not to hold on..."), removing ambiguity and resonance. This didactic approach flattens the subtext entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric but is undermined by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases. The narrative distance is stable, yet the prose feels more constructed than organic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Significant deductions for repetitive artifacts: "rust-hued peace" (3x), "here-and-gone" (4x), and "hauntingly practical" (2x) create a loop effect. These forced repetitions disrupt the rhythm and make the prose feel algorithmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The combination of lion carving and time crystallization is imaginative, but the execution relies too heavily on stating the prompt elements. The potential for a unique magic realism piece is dampened by the repetitive and explanatory prose.</comment>
