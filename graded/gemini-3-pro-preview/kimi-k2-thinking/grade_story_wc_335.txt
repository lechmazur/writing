<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is explicitly stated ("Lin is the reason") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the "combative tenderness" is applied as a label rather than enacted. The choice to stay is pivotal, but the archivist's interiority relies on stock phrases ("bend, not break") rather than specific, embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is legible as Earned Stasis with a clear cost (remaining in exile) that validates the "reversible exile" premise. The causal link between the tea leaf geometry and the annotation is established early and pays off, holding the drive lens effectively through the final decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric but relies on "purple" descriptions ("dust motes seem to hold their breath") that feel cliché. While the "shard-mirror" concept is interesting, sensory details often serve the prose style rather than constraining character choice or creating tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (return vs. remain) is clear, but the escalation is low-pressure; the choice feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost of staying is felt conceptually, but the opposition is minimal, making the final decision feel like a gentle affirmation rather than a crucible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The theme is didactic, with the narrator explicitly defining resilience ("not about never falling, but about rising") multiple times. This sermonizing ("In the heart of that silence, resilience is annotated...") flattens subtext and replaces earned resonance with a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the meaning of actions ("a lesson in motion and stillness") instead of letting them stand. The tone is consistent but overly guided, lacking the distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but laden with clichés ("blade wrapped in silk," "dust motes hold their breath") and abstract metaphors ("labyrinths of hesitation") that distance the reader. These artifacts obscure the immediacy of the scene and reduce the emotional impact of the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "shard-mirror archivist" and "reversible exile" are inventive concepts that elevate the standard mentor-apprentice trope. However, the execution relies on familiar "fable" rhythms and stock wisdom, preventing the story from feeling truly fresh or surprising.</comment>
