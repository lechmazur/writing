<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is distinct, blending professional expertise with personal regret. The internal conflict (legacy vs. truth) drives the scene effectively. Moira serves as a catalyst but her dialogue occasionally drifts into functional wisdom rather than organic character expression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight; the inciting tooth leads directly to the confrontation and resolution. The backstory is integrated efficiently without stalling the present action. Closure lands with a clear Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's life work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze serve as excellent constraints and symbols, charging the final image. Specific details like the "rusted trellises" and "final wall of yew" ground the metaphor in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are high and personal; Elena's entire career is the cost of the truth. The pressure escalates from the initial forensic evidence to the face-to-face dismantling of her theory. The resolution feels earned through her willingness to accept failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of narrative repair ("bone setting") is resonant and well-developed. However, the score is capped by a Thematic Echo in dialogue; Moira articulates the thesis ("certainty is a kind of cruelty") too explicitly, reducing subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and intelligent. Moira's dialogue feels slightly stagey and aphoristic ("Failure is just the first draft of memory"), which detracts from the naturalism of the encounter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and strong imagery (morning glories as points of light). A few metaphors border on overwriting ("cleft in certainty wide enough to swallow..."), but the rhythm and clarity generally hold up well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of "folklore forensics" being scientifically applied—and then proven wrong by mundane tragedy—is a fresh, ingenious subversion of changeling tropes. It grounds the fantastical in human error effectively.</comment>
