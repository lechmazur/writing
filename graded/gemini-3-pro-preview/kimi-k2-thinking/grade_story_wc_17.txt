<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined almost entirely by the repeated label "sensitively perceptive" rather than enacted complexity or distinctive interiority. Her emotional arc—from observer to activist—is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices under pressure. The motivation is stated clearly but functions more as a tagline than a source of deep internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the ending dissolves into a broad summary ("Mira spent weeks," "reclamation movement") that diffuses tension. The inciting incident works, but the resolution lacks a specific, dramatized scene of confrontation or high-cost decision, relying instead on a montage-like conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "sonic fossil" concept creates a distinct atmosphere, and the ivy-choked university is visualized with some clarity. However, the setting details often feel like static dressing rather than obstacles that constrain action, and the specific phrase "ivy-veiled passage" is repeated mechanically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic rather than immediate; there is little external resistance to Mira's discovery or her subsequent actions. The conflict resolves too easily—finding the data leads directly to a successful global movement without on-page struggle, cost, or opposition, reducing the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the walls literally articulating the theme ("Remember, but act") and the narration explaining the "legacy's burden" directly to the reader. This didactic approach flattens the subtext, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Voice is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of multi-word prompt phrases ("sensitively perceptive," "film negative strip"). This mechanical insertion creates a stuttering, artificial rhythm that distances the reader and prevents a natural narrative voice from emerging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is marred by extreme repetitive phrasing; "sensitively perceptive" appears five times, "film negative strip" five times, and "half-burned diaries" four times in a short space. These text artifacts act as scaffolding that was never removed, obscuring the otherwise competent grammar and imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "corridor echo cartographer" premise is inventive and offers a fresh lens on post-apocalyptic exploration. However, the execution falls into standard tropes (finding the scientist's ignored warning, the math that could have saved us), and the "rebuilding society" ending feels familiar and unearned.</comment>
