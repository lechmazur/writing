<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Malach is a distinct, focused protagonist with clear motivation (method over myth). However, his defining trait ("rationally rebellious") is told rather than shown via explicit labels, and his survival relies on a passive reaction from the antagonist rather than his own active agency or cunning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setup and orientation are strong, but the closure suffers from a causality break. The patrolman's decision to spare Malach solely due to "confusion" and "absence of sentiment" contradicts the established high stakes (executions of archivists) and feels like a convenient soft reset to ensure survival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's standout feature, with visceral details like "corpse-bloat" and "phosphorescent fungus." The stratification of the city is woven beautifully into the physical action, though the patrol's visual presence is slightly less vivid than the sewer itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tension builds effectively with the approaching footsteps and the race to encode the data. However, the climax deflates rapidly; the antagonist's unexplained leniency undercuts the life-or-death stakes established early on, robbing the resolution of its earned cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "truth as method" vs. "mythology" is intellectually compelling and tightly integrated with the cog artifact. The resonance is slightly dampened by heavy-handed exposition ("The seafarer's chronometer represented method"), but the final image remains conceptually strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a precise, detached consistency that mirrors the protagonist's worldview. The shift to the patrolman's perspective ("confused by...") is a slight POV wobble, but the overall control of tone and distance is effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally dense and evocative ("stories written in silt and bones"). However, the repetition of the phrase "rationally rebellious" as a descriptor creates a text artifact, and several moments rely on telling ("preached their single narrative") where showing would have been stronger.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central concept of stratigraphy as a counter-narrative and the use of the cog as a data-storage device are ingenious and fresh. The intellectual nature of the rebellion offers a unique angle on the post-apocalyptic genre.</comment>
