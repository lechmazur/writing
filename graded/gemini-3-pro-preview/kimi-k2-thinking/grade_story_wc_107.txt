<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek is a vividly drawn, specific protagonist whose internal contradiction—using fire to understand frost, crafting vessels for unanswerable questions—drives the narrative. The performative trait of narrating to the machinery grounds his loneliness without slipping into melodrama. The grief is embodied in action (glassblowing) rather than just internal monologue, meeting the high standard for characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure effectively utilizes a compressed timeline (Track B Mosaic) to mirror the accelerating thaw, moving fluidly from the inciting leak to the nocturnal creation and final morning ritual. Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the bookmark's destruction ("soaked and darkened") into a tool for healing carries a legible, felt cost. The logic holds firmly under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting acts as a second protagonist; the "groaning" reservoir and the "sweating" concrete walls actively pressure Marek’s choices. The integration of the glassblowing equipment into the industrial decay creates a unique, tactile atmosphere where the physical leak mirrors the internal release. Specific details like the "bird's-nest wiring" and the gauge frozen at "forty-two" anchor the metaphor in concrete reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The internal stakes are high and clearly defined: the struggle between preserving grief (the frozen state) and allowing the messy thaw of acceptance. The escalation is subtle but distinct, moving from passive observation of the leak to the active creation of the "Reservoir" bowl. The cost is visible in the further cracking of the cherished bookmark, a necessary sacrifice that validates the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "safe zones for inquiry" is resonant and beautifully woven through the glassblowing metaphor. However, the explicit labeling of the "Reservoir of Unasked Things" and phrases like "unclenching of the valley's collective heart" verge on being too on-the-nose, slightly reducing the subtextual power. The final image of the gauge flickering is a masterful, understated thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately "contemplative," matching Marek’s trade and temperament. The shift from the technical language of the dam to the poetic register of the glassblower feels organic and earned. The pacing controls the release of information well, mirroring the slow thaw described in the text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong and rhythmic ("creased like the palm of a hand"), but occasional lapses into abstractions or clichés ("rusted bolts of old resolve," "weighty lightness") mar the otherwise high-density writing. The "collective heart" line feels slightly overwrought compared to the sharper, more grounded imagery of the silica and the kiln.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glassblower occupying an abandoned dam control room is strikingly original and visually compelling. The concept of "question jars" and the specific ritual of floating the bookmark provide a fresh, non-obvious approach to the familiar trope of grieving. The story takes a specific, risky premise and executes it with serious artistic intent.</comment>
