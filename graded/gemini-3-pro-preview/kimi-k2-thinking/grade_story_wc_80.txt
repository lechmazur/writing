<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation is driven by sudden epiphanies ("motivation crystallized," "method came to him whole") rather than earned struggle or pressure. The emotional climax feels slightly melodramatic ("mortar mixed from his own tears"), and the shift from surveyor to mystic archaeologist lacks sufficient on-page grounding in his prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and the closure—lying to the council to buy time—is a valid Resisive Change with professional cost. However, the central turning point relies on a convenient download of inspiration (the method arriving instantly) rather than causal derivation from the scene's constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric ("green-filtered light," "coral fingers"), effectively establishing the drowned district. The setting actively constrains the character, though the specific era and rules of the world (steampunk vs. historical) remain slightly ambiguous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>External pressure is low; the isolation functions more as a timeout than a ticking clock with immediate threats. The conflict is primarily internal and resolved through industriousness rather than difficult trade-offs, until the final professional deception adds a layer of genuine stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "interlaced absence" is poignant and shapes the resolution, but it is articulated through explicit narration rather than emerging organically from subtext. The concept of preserving abandoned dreams is emotionally resonant but borders on sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the "stoic" character. However, it relies occasionally on "telling" internal states ("He moved stoically sensitive") rather than demonstrating them through distinct perception or reaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A significant tense error in the climax ("he wrest the cornerstone" should be *wrested*) undermines the prose quality. Additionally, awkward phrasing like "moved stoically sensitive" and purple descriptors ("hushed blaze," "mortar of memory") detract from the otherwise solid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept—embedding memorial notes in the mortar of structural repairs—is a highly original and poetic synthesis of the surveyor and archaeologist roles. It elevates the familiar "ruin explorer" trope into something fresh.</comment>
