<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—reclaiming lost time—is clear and poignantly grounded in the postpartum context. However, the emotional experience often filters through high-concept metaphor ("weight of a gaze," "luminous burden") rather than visceral embodiment, creating a slight mythic distance that keeps the character archetypal rather than specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ritualistic progression provides a solid structure, moving from inquiry to resolution. However, the climax relies on an external force ("voice like wind") explicitly explaining the lesson to the protagonist, rather than forcing her to earn the realization through the pressure of the scene itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "midnight glade" and "invisible tablecloth of mist" create a cohesive, ethereal atmosphere that suits the fable mode. The use of the dolls' tea set as a grounding artifact amidst the abstract magic is excellent, anchoring the surreal setting in tangible memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The internal stakes of motherhood and identity are well-established, but the conflict resolution feels intellectually gifted by the narrative voice rather than wrestled from the antagonist (time). The pressure remains contemplative, lacking a moment where the protagonist must make a difficult trade-off under stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly decodes its own symbolism ("This was her cloudbound repentance: to accept that..."), converting potential subtext into text. This didactic approach, where a voice whispers the thematic thesis directly to the character, flattens the resonance into a moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lyrical, fable-like voice is consistent and confident, effectively maintaining the magical realist tone. However, the register occasionally tips into overwrought description ("liquid obsidian," "pregnant and full"), and the integration of prompt phrases feels slightly mechanical within the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the imagery is dense, distinct phrases repeat noticeably within the short word count ("choking" x3, "willingly perplexed" x2, "cloudbound" x2), creating a looping effect. The prose tends toward adjectival stacking ("perfect memory," "silver light," "pink fingers") that slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of the body as a tablecloth recording the "phantom hands" of experience is a striking and original synthesis of the elements. The story successfully blends the prompt constraints into a unified, if slightly formulaic, fable about postpartum transformation.</comment>
