<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lina serves primarily as a passive observer ("witness") rather than an active agent under pressure. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("silent scream," "ghost") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. While the motivation to solve the puzzle is clear, she faces no difficult choices or meaningful costs in pursuing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, linear path from discovery to realization, but the "delayed revelation" is delivered through exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The causality is intellectual—she reads data and understands—lacking a visceral turning point or a moment where the outcome was in doubt. Closure is achieved, but it feels like a low-stakes conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting of the floating station is established with some solid details ("mildewed charts," "steel railing"). The environment functionally supports the isolation theme but does not actively constrain Lina's choices or force a trade-off. The sensory details are consistent but often lean into standard climate-fiction tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the conflict is between a woman and a data discrepancy, with no immediate consequence for failure. There is no escalation of pressure; the mystery is solved simply by looking at the files, and the "cost" is a philosophical acceptance of loss rather than a paid price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is heavily didactic, with the narrative explicitly explaining the meaning of the corals and the shipping lanes ("paths disappear because the underlying assumptions had changed"). The prompt phrase "periodically eternal" is repeated five times, bludgeoning the reader with the motif rather than allowing resonance to emerge organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("Lina [verb]...", "She [verb]...") that create a monotonous rhythm. The overuse of the specific phrase "periodically eternal" disrupts the narrative flow, making the voice feel mechanical and prompt-bound rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prose is marred by severe repetition of the phrase "periodically eternal" (five occurrences), which acts as a jarring text artifact. Additionally, the writing relies on clichés ("silent scream," "heartbeat of the ocean," "white shroud") and filter verbs ("She noticed," "She wondered") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise of a post-fossil-fuel world where legacy damage persists is sound, but the execution falls into a standard, contemplative vignette style. The "mystery" of the shipping lane feels like a logic puzzle rather than a fresh narrative turn, and the resolution offers a familiar message about resilience without a unique twist.</comment>
