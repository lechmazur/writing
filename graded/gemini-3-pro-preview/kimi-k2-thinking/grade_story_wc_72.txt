<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Petra is distinct as a POV, and the shift from guardian of dogma to guardian of doubt is legible. However, the motivation relies heavily on explicit labeling ("Petra's incisively kind nature... compelled her to act") rather than dramatized struggle, and the internal conflict is resolved somewhat easily by the "cascading" memories rather than a difficult choice between equal pressures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal line from the diver's arrival to Petra's decision. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (the city's purpose recontextualized). The "decades later" time jump, however, dissipates the immediate scene tension and summarizes the consequences rather than keeping the pressure in the dramatic present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like "green twilight," "limestone bones," and "foxglove-stained ampoule." The environment actively informs the theme (stone vs. water, rigid vs. fluid).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stakes are high abstractly (the soul of the city) but low concretely; there is no active antagonist or immediate time pressure beyond the diver's initial death. The conflict is largely internal and philosophical, lacking a moment where Petra faces external resistance or a visceral trade-off beyond the conceptual loss of "certainty."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story suffers from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("learned the one truth that mattered: that no truth was ever singular"). The theme is stated directly in the narrative voice rather than emerging through subtext, which flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, elevated, and mythic, fitting the "stone statue" persona well. It stumbles occasionally into adjective-heavy phrasing ("beautiful, dangerous gift," "crushing clarity") that feels slightly overwritten.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose has strong moments of imagery but relies on abstract telling for key emotional beats ("revelation detached something," "compelled her to act"). The use of prompt terms as explicit labels ("incisively kind nature") disrupts the immersive quality, and clichéd pairings like "beautiful, dangerous" detract from the freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of a statue curing a city with doubt is sound, but the execution leans on familiar tropes of hubristic drowned civilizations. The resolution feels safe and somewhat fable-like rather than offering a sharp, unexpected human (or statue) insight.</comment>
