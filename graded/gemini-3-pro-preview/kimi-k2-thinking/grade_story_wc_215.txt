<question>1</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies entirely on explicit labeling ("astonished," "tranquilly perceptive") rather than embodied action. Motivation is stated directly in exposition ("Her motivation was to preserve...") rather than emerging from desire or conflict. There is no internal contradiction or felt cost to her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative reads as a summary or outline rather than a dramatized scene. Causality is driven by authorial assertion ("She realized the covenant was broken") rather than logical progression or on-page discovery. The ending is a soft resolution where the ghost simply dissolves without a decisive, costly action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The setting is established through generic adjectives ("scorched," "rusted," "fractured") rather than specific, sensory interaction. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resources that shape the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>There is no meaningful resistance or escalation; the protagonist identifies a problem and resolves it immediately without obstacle. The stakes remain abstract ("unspoken words") and the resolution involves no sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The theme is hammered home through verbatim repetition of the phrase "weight of unspoken words" rather than subtext. The story tells the reader what it means instead of allowing meaning to emerge from the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The voice is mechanical and distant, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The narration relies on repeating prompt phrases to bridge gaps, resulting in a robotic texture that prevents immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Severe repetitive artifacts render the prose unpublishable; key phrases ("mute eloquence," "tangled covenant," "tranquilly perceptive") are repeated 3–5 times each in a short space. The prose tells rather than shows ("Through contextual clues she sensed..."), violating basic craft standards.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The story is a formulaic assembly of the required elements without synthesis or fresh insight. It reads like a checklist completion rather than a creative work, lacking risk or genuine emotional specificity.</comment>
