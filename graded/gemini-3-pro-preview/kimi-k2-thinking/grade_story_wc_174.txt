<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Adrian is a distinct, urbane presence, and his motivation is clear, though primarily expository ("quiet obsession"). His interiority is stable, but he functions more as a catalyst for the audience than a protagonist undergoing high-stakes internal conflict himself; he ends the story largely unchanged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing the single scene to build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration of the audience's reality. The "un-telling" mechanic provides a strong causal spine that lands a legible conceptual cost at closure as the characters confront their stripped-down truths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "Dish" is an excellent, specific setting that actively constraints the atmosphere and thematically amplifies the "silence" and "glare." The physical details—rusted girders, the cracked parabolic ceiling—effectively ground the abstract nature of the performance in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent, but the conflict is largely unidirectional—Adrian acting upon a passive audience—rather than a contested struggle. While the stakes for the audience are high (existential realization), Adrian himself faces little opposition or risk of failure, limiting the tension of the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is potent but is articulated too explicitly in the narrative ("This was the core he sought: that every story is a series of erasures..."). This overt "telling" of the subtext deflates the narrative tension by explaining the meaning via a thesis statement rather than letting it resonate implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story utilizes rapid, unmotivated head-hopping mid-scene ("the trucker saw," "the dealer saw," "a woman... saw"), violating the standard for controlled narrative distance. This omniscience feels convenient rather than structural, blurring the focalization during the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is lush and atmospherically dense, though it leans into repetitive stylistic artifacts ("un-died, un-betrayed, un-lived"). The rhythm is generally strong, but the reliance on the "un-" prefix becomes a noticeable scaffold, and the phrase "meteor hush" is reused to diminishing effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a calligrapher using reverse puppetry in a radar dome to deconstruct narrative truth is highly original and executed with specific, non-generic details. The synthesis of setting, action, and character vocation feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
