<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Iyana’s internal landscape is vivid, and her motivation to find belonging drives the narrative logic. However, the transition from exile to fatal transformation feels less like a struggle and more like a surrender to inevitable poetic logic; the epiphany resolves the conflict instantly rather than through a series of escalating micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from investigation to realization to decision within a single scene. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change (transformation/death), satisfying the rubric. Causality is somewhat soft, relying on the magical properties of the feather ("ghost-maps") rather than mechanical pressure, but it holds under a Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and strictly constrains the protagonist's options (oxygen, pressure, waterlock). Details like "rust-flowers" and "coral reefs of brass" effectively merge the industrial with the organic, supporting the central theme of transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are high (survival vs. transcendence) and the ticking clock (oxygen/submersible) provides clear external pressure. However, the external pressure remains static—a countdown—rather than evolving dynamically to force tactical shifts before the final binary choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of belonging is central, but the story relies on a direct thesis statement ("Belonging was not a place you occupied, but a waveform...") to articulate it. This explicit telling in the climax flattens the subtext and triggers the penalty for thematic sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the "astrologer" persona. However, the integration of required phrases like "softly ingenious" disrupts the voice's natural rhythm, creating momentarily jarring notes in an otherwise smooth delivery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high metaphor density ("dying leviathan," "breathing shadow," "geometry ghosts") that occasionally obscures clarity. The usage of "softly ingenious" to describe a feather is a semantic category error that breaks immersion, and the text relies heavily on filter verbs ("Iyana knew," "Iyana felt").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of "landscape astrology" with an underwater setting offers a fresh visual aesthetic. While the "transcendence through drowning" trope is familiar (reminiscent of *The Abyss* or *Bioshock*), the specific execution through the lens of geometry and resonance adds a distinct flavor.</comment>
