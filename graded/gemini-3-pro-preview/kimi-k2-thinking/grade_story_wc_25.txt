<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marek is a competent, active protagonist with distinct skills, but he functions as a static archetype who faces no internal doubt or genuine cost. The "competence porn" dynamic means he executes a plan perfectly without emotional struggle or character growth, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The resolution relies on a "technobabble" mechanic (a tuning fork transmitting a complex spoken sentence through disconnected containers) that breaks verisimilitude in a grounded setting. Additionally, the closure lacks a "visible or felt cost," resolving the conflict too neatly via this magic trick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, acting as both instrument and obstacle; the "acoustic architecture" of the container yard is vividly rendered. The atmosphere of the storm is tactile and shapes the action, though the zodiac overlay feels slightly less integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the antagonist is a straw man who is defeated instantly by the protagonist's pre-established skills. There is no moment of "deepening" where Marek must sacrifice something or adapt painfully; the victory feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("whispers carry further than screams") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending devolves into sermonizing ("silence builds better bridges"), triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic for the fable-like tone. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally relies on filtering ("Marek knew," "He identified") rather than direct immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear but marred by "explainer" sentences ("The key... was a tuning fork in disguise") and abstract labels ("calculated spontaneity"). Some jargon ("harmonic node") clutters the description without adding sensory clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a container yard as an acoustic instrument is inventive and fresh. While the execution leans into magical realism to solve the plot, the premise itself offers a unique angle on the industrial setting.</comment>
