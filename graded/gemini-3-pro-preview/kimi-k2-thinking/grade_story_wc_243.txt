<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks specific interiority or agency, serving merely as a vessel for prompt terms. Emotions are delivered via repeated diagnostic labels ("haunted euphoria") rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Causality breaks at the resolution; a private act of journaling inexplicably triggers a public social phenomenon ("Whispers spread"). The ending relies on unearned magical healing rather than logical consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Setting details like "cedar shelf" and "night-blooming jasmine" are generic clichés that do not constrain the character. The environment is decorative rather than a source of pressure or resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The story lacks meaningful conflict or stakes; the "steep path" is a minor physical detail, not a dramatic obstacle. The protagonist faces no opposition, difficult choices, or potential for failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("When context changes...") in the final line, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is replaced by summary statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The voice oscillates awkwardly between flowery melodrama ("salt-kissed") and jarring legal/technical jargon ("proximate cause," "context"). The tone is inconsistent and artificial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The text suffers from severe repetitive artifacts ("proximate cause" is used three times in identical template phrases). Clunky puns ("steep of the tea/hillside") and diagnostic labels degrade the prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The narrative reads like a mechanical assembly of prompt constraints without organic synthesis or fresh insight. The "archivist healing the world" trope is executed without novelty.</comment>
