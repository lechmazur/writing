<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's "inadvertent stubbornness" is a strong conceptual anchor that pays off in the closure's realization of entrapment. However, agency is diluted in the middle section; the solution to the lens's repair arrives passively via "dreams" rather than through active ingenuity or struggle, slightly dampening the character's competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary ("Days blurred into weeks") to traverse the central action of rebuilding the lens, which deflates immediate scene tension. The "dream" mechanism used to provide the repair instructions functions as a convenient shortcut, bypassing the causal friction of solving the puzzle on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "impossible architecture" of the drowned library grounding the surreal elements effectively. The physical integration of the environment (shelves groaning, waterlogged histories) consistently pressures the tone and supports the "eternal occupation" theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the cost of the undertaking—physical transformation and eternal service—is palpable and high. While the escalation is somewhat smoothed over by the summary middle, the final realization of the trap provides a satisfying crystallization of the conflict under an accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The thematic arc from seeking release to accepting an "eternal occupation" is resonant and well-executed. The closure reconfigures the protagonist's initial goal (leaving) into a permanent state of duty (staying) without stating a simple moral, achieving a strong Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and elevated tone suitable for the genre. There is a slight tendency toward overwrought phrasing ("wrinkles of silt and sorrow"), but the narrative stance remains stable and the internal texture aligns well with the protagonist's weariness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent but marred by some "literary" clichés (e.g., "bypassed ears and spoke directly to marrow," "dying heartbeat") and mixed metaphors ("wrinkles of silt"). The use of summary ("Days blurred into weeks") creates a rhythmic lull that saps momentum during the pivotal construction phase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater undertaker repurposing a lighthouse lens to guide souls is imaginative and distinct. The synthesis of the library setting with the lighthouse function feels fresh and offers a unique angle on the "restless dead" trope.</comment>
