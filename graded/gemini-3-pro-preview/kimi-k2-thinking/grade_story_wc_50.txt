<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent archetype rather than a complex character. He faces a technical puzzle but no internal contradiction, doubt, or difficult choice that reveals values under pressure. He works "without haste" and succeeds through mastery, lacking the vulnerability or conflicting impulses required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and logical, following a clear problem-solution structure that leads to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The inciting incident (silence) and climax (releasing the echoes) are causally linked, though the linear progression lacks significant setbacks or complications to test the design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the cavern's acoustics and the "wounded season" actively constrain and guide the mechanics of the solution. The sensory details of the tuning forks interacting with the marble veins are vivid and functional, grounding the magical elements in concrete physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic rather than visceral, and the conflict lacks urgency or personal risk. The protagonist works "without haste," removing time pressure, and faces no antagonist or potential for failure. The resolution comes through patience rather than sacrifice or a high-stakes trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of processing grief by releasing rather than hoarding memories is coherent and lands with a satisfying conceptual turn. The pivot from "harvesting" to "sharing" resonates well with the "wounded season" motif, though the "cellar of reason" phrasing leans slightly toward abstract telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fable-like, atmospheric voice is consistent and suits the magical realism genre. The narrative distance is appropriate for the reflective tone, though it occasionally drifts into slightly elevated or purple registers that distance the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but relies on some clichés ("world held its breath," "autumn's final gasp") and expository characterization ("peripherally focused by nature"). While the imagery of the mechanism is strong, the "cellar of reason" metaphor feels overwritten and abstract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic chronomancy—using sound reflections to map time—is imaginative and fresh. While the "craftsman fixing a magical device" setup is familiar, the specific execution involving the "wounded season's" overload adds a distinct and poetic layer to the premise.</comment>
