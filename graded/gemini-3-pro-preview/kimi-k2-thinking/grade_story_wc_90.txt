<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional; the contradiction between the pacifist ideal and the specific act of violence (withholding medicine) drives the narrative engine. The Boddhisattva parallel is earned through action, culminating in a closure that perfectly embodies the character's internal logic. The emotional physiology (gravity linked to guilt) offers a unique, character-specific constraint that shapes every move.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong, with a clear causal chain leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist achieves the goal but renounces the reward. The closure is definitive and costly. A slight deduction for the "method came to her in a dream" beat, which feels like a convenient shortcut to connect the clues rather than active discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and tightly integrated with the character's psyche; the ship breathing through "lungs of salvaged alien tech" and the gravity bonding with her emotions creates a unified experience. The micro-setting of the photographs serves as the physical terrain for the climax, effectively constraining the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through the specific mechanism of the "shadow work" stitching, deepening from a physical task to an emotional reckoning. The cost is palpable—the weight of admitted guilt pressing her to the deck. The final reconfiguration of the dominant stake (from escape to service) is earned by the deepening process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of integrated pacifism ("absorbing violence... to transform it") is inextricably linked to the plot mechanics and the final image. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, avoiding a simple moral in favor of a complex, embodied stance (the Bodhisattva vow).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending high-concept sci-fi with a mythic, elegiac tone that suits the subject matter. The perspective remains tightly controlled within Maya's unique sensorium. The voice successfully carries the weight of the backstory without drowning the present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and propulsive, with strong rhythm in the stitching sequence. However, reliance on stock literary phrasings like "curled like grief itself," "stars hung like unanswered prayers," and "terrible beauty" detracts slightly from the otherwise specific imagery, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a high level of ingenuity by synthesizing spiritual concepts (Bodhisattva, shadow work) with hard sci-fi mechanics (gravity, warp cores) in a fresh way. The central metaphor of stitching photographs to weave a soul is distinct and memorable.</comment>
