<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to restore her sister is clear, but her characterization relies heavily on the repeated tags "reckless idealist" and "fiercely gentle" rather than dramatized complexity. While the sacrifice is a significant choice, the emotional interiority feels constrained by these recurrent labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows a solid Causal trajectory with a clear transaction and closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the aftermath—where she feels her sister's pulse and love despite surrendering the memories required to define that bond—slightly blurs the established cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "catacomb orchard" where roots intertwine with bones is a vivid, atmospheric concept that effectively grounds the scene. Sensory details like the "waxen smear" and "rustling leaves" establish a strong, distinct sense of place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (destiny vs. memory) and the Keeper provides effective external pressure. The escalation is linear and functional, though the climax resolves quickly with a single action, lacking a deeper complication of the trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of "memories for miracles" is central and legible. However, the resonance is dampened by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which makes the emotional conclusion feel more like a checklist completion than an earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is severely compromised by the verbatim repetition of specific phrases ("fiercely gentle," "inlaying meaning," "trammel") multiple times within a short word count. This creates a stilted, artificial rhythm that breaks immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant text artifacts act as a drag on the prose; complex phrases like "inlaying meaning everywhere" and "fiercely gentle" are repeated 3–4 times each. This extreme redundancy signals a failure to integrate required elements organically, resulting in visible scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the setting of the bone orchard is imaginative, the core narrative of an imperfect resurrection via a memory trade is a familiar trope. The execution does not sufficiently transform the premise, hindered further by the repetitive phrasing.</comment>
