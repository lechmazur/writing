<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is delivered through diagnostic label-speak ("My motivation surges") rather than embodied action. The transition from ghost-listener to rescuer feels mechanical, driven by prompt compliance rather than internal coherence. The protagonist lacks a distinct internal life beyond the functional role of the "contact tracer."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The central twist relies on a causality break: the hearing aid decodes the specific name "Lila," but this is later dismissed as the pulse of an unrelated dying man without explanation. The inciting incident (the photo/name) and the climax (the heart attack) are linked only by coincidence, not organic narrative drive. Closure is weak, relying on a rapid, low-stakes rescue by arriving paramedics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The setting relies heavily on atmospheric clichés ("ghostly sentinels," "shroud," "mist-clad") rather than specific, tactile details. The environment serves as a generic backdrop for the mood rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices. The "atrium" feels indistinct, lacking a specific geography that influences the rescue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Stakes are external and resolved too easily; the protagonist presses their hands on a chest, and professionals arrive "moments later" to solve the problem. There is no felt cost or difficult trade-off for the protagonist, making the "heroism" feel unearned. Escalation is abrupt—a sudden crash—rather than a rising tide of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative explicitly states its themes and prompt elements ("My incidental heroism blooms"), destroying subtext. The story tells the reader how to interpret events rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. This meta-commentary flattens the emotional resonance of the rescue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently melodramatic, prioritizing "poetic" sounding phrases over narrative clarity. The narration distances the reader with overt explanations of feelings ("curiosity flares") instead of immersing them in the sensory experience of the contact tracer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from severe simile fatigue, with nearly every description relying on a comparison ("thin as fog," "like a struck match," "like glass chimes," "like a shroud"). Artifacts of prompt-forcing are visible in lines like "My motivation surges," which reads as functional scaffolding rather than literary prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the concept of a hearing aid for the dead has promise, the execution relies on the familiar "ghost is actually a living person" trope. The lack of a fresh twist or deep character work leaves the story feeling like a standard exercise rather than a unique vision.</comment>
