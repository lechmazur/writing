<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara is a competent and driven protagonist, though her defining trait, &quot;cautiously hopeful,&quot; relies heavily on labeling rather than purely organic demonstration. Her internal conflict is legible, but the &quot;power plays&quot; with rivals are delivered via summary rather than dramatized interaction, distancing the reader from her immediate social pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure is coherent, but the inciting incident relies on a significant knowledge leap where Mara interprets complex alien intent (&quot;tricksters embedding infra-linguistic commands&quot;) instantly from a spectrogram. This shortcuts the investigative process. The closure effectively resolves the immediate plot while acknowledging the lingering human cost, satisfying the requirements of a Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is established with strong sensory details—&quot;burnt coffee, ozone, and old vinyl&quot;—that ground the cosmic stakes in a tactile, lived-in reality. The physical constraints of the &quot;cramped broadcast booth&quot; effectively mirror the pressure of the situation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and high, blending personal career risk with community survival. However, the escalation is dampened by the summary delivery of the antagonistic forces (the Dean and Dr. Chen) during the middle bridge, making the pressure feel reported rather than felt in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The thematic resolution is the story's strongest element, avoiding a tidy &quot;fix-it&quot; ending by acknowledging that human division persists without alien interference. The shift from cosmic paranoia to mundane mistrust provides a resonant, earned nuance to the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately tense, though it occasionally slips into &quot;telling&quot; internal realizations to speed the plot (&quot;Mara saw the real chess match was cosmic&quot;). The perspective remains tightly anchored to Mara, maintaining a stable filter on events.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is functional and clear, with some vivid imagery (&quot;paint peeled... like dead skin&quot;), but momentum drags during the summary bridge (&quot;Mara spent three sleepless nights&quot;). Some phrasing feels slightly forced to accommodate prompt words, creating minor textural hiccups.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of aliens feeding on human negative emotion is a familiar sci-fi trope (reminiscent of Star Trek's &quot;Day of the Dove&quot;). While the radio station setting adds a nice analog texture, the &quot;counter-frequency&quot; resolution is a standard technobabble solution that lacks a fresh twist.</comment>
