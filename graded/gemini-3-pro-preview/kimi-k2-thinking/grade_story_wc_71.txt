<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a functional cipher defined solely by the prompt label "creeping normality noticer," which acts as a repetitive title rather than a name. He faces no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or struggle, performing a magical service that succeeds instantly without cost or character growth. The motivation is stated as an abstract desire rather than a felt drive under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear list of successful actions without resistance, complication, or causal tightening. Closure is a summary of total success ("story... becomes a legend") without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that carries a felt price. The plot lacks a turning point, as the protagonist's plan works perfectly from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting details rely on the verbatim repetition of "quiet bay in spring" and "streetlights daydream" (appearing four times) rather than specific, evolving sensory work. The atmosphere is generic and fable-like, lacking the concrete grounding or spatial specificity required to make the environment feel lived-in or crucial to the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>There is no conflict, antagonist, or internal barrier; the protagonist faces no opposition in his quest to sanctify the houses. Stakes are declared ("to understand") but never threatened or tested, and the story proceeds without escalation or trade-offs, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("he realized that the act of noticing... was a prayer") rather than subtext. The story repeatedly tells the reader the moral ("silence can be a living thing") instead of allowing meaning to emerge from dramatic action or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is mechanical, marred by the clumsy insertion of prompt phrases that disrupts natural rhythm. The constant use of the full title "creeping normality noticer" (seven times) and the refrain "streetlights daydream" prevents immersion and creates a drone-like cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition of prompt phrases triggers major artifact penalties; "creeping normality noticer" appears seven times and "streetlights daydream" four times. The prose lacks syntactic variety, relying on abstract assertions and repetitive sentence stems ("He [verb]...") that flatten the momentum and texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story reads like a checklist of constraints pasted into a generic magical-realism fable without organic synthesis. The interpretation of "creeping normality" is counter-intuitive and unexplained, serving only as a label, and the narrative lacks a fresh or specific angle on its premise.</comment>
