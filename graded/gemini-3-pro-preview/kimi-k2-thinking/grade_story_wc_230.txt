<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies on label-speak ("rational truffle forager," "cultivate psychological safety") rather than embodied traits. The protagonist's "rational" nature disappears immediately upon finding the artifact, and the motivation is stated as an abstract concept rather than a felt drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The narrative is a summary spanning days ("One dawn," "In the days that followed") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default. Closure is a synopsis of a new status quo rather than an on-page decisive change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting functions largely as a pathetic fallacy ("echoing my own inner turmoil") rather than a concrete place. While the "sap of the storm-scarred trees" integrates into the resolution, the environment generally lacks sensory specificity beyond generic storm tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Conflict is resolved through a low-stakes reversal where the feared consequence (truth destroying the community) simply fails to materialize ("truth did not destroy; instead, it peeled away the armor"). The resolution creates safety without exacting a dramatized price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("truth did not destroy... instead it peeled away the armor") and diagnostic jargon ("psychological safety") inserted verbatim. The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The voice suffers from high narrative distance, reading more like a fable synopsis than an inhabited perspective. The tone is consistent but melodramatic, keeping the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense with mixed metaphors ("taste of truth," "splinter I could not swallow") and clichés ("glinting like a forgotten promise," "inner turmoil"). Frequent repetition of prompt terms ("occlude," "psychological safety") creates mechanical rhythm and artifacting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The disparate elements—truffle foraging, a glass eye, and corporate-speak ("psychological safety")—are stitched together without organic synthesis. The story feels like a checklist completion rather than a cohesive narrative vision.</comment>
