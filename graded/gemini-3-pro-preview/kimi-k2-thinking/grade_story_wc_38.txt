<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is hyper-competent and lacks internal conflict or flaws; her "spirit remained unbroken" from the start, leaving no room for an arc. The character feels like a vehicle for the concept rather than a person under pressure, with no contradictory impulses or costly choices on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The resolution relies on a significant causality break: the AI inexplicably interprets an interpretative dance of a circuit diagram as a legitimate maintenance protocol to unlock doors, which reads as "magic hacking." The ending dissolves into an "explain-everything" summary ("Later, when the rescue team found...") rather than an on-page closure with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "flickering diodes" and "jawbone of a whale" are vivid, but the setting largely functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint. The "sunken lab" trope is handled competently but does not force specific tactical trade-offs beyond the general threat of water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear progression of success without escalation or reversals; the plan works perfectly on the first try. There is no moment where the protagonist's agency is tested by failure or a new complication, and she pays no visible cost for her liberation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated ("encrypt her vulnerability into strength") rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The ending moralizes directly ("vulnerability, encoded, became the key"), reducing resonance to a lesson rather than an experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the "lyrical code-breaker" persona, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The narrative distance remains stable, though the stylized tone sometimes dampens the immediacy of the physical danger.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from overwriting and heavy metaphor use ("grim of fate," "baptism," "alchemy") that distances the reader. The final paragraph serves as a summary scaffolding that explains the plot, violating the show-don't-tell principle at the most critical moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core concept of "dance hacking" is inventive but executed with a lack of plausible grounding, making it feel like a checklist synthesis of prompt elements. The story synthesizes the required items well but relies on a "rule of cool" logic that strains credulity.</comment>
