<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal state (the healer who remains wounded) is clear but static; her choice to remain "unincised" is a backstory premise rather than a struggle dramatized in the scene. The customers function more as thematic props than distinct agents, and the vendor's emotional progression is steady rather than pressured by the encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative structure is competent, stacking interactions to build a portrait of the trade before the final reflection. Closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the vendor re-commits to her role. The narrative arc is legible, though the pacing is uniform.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and consistent ("swirling sea of clouds," "crystalline counter"), creating a distinct dreamlike mood. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop; the specific geography of the library or the clouds rarely constrains the vendor's tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic rather than immediate; the vendor faces no resistance from customers or environment, resulting in low narrative pressure. The "opening day" timeframe adds no urgency (no crowds, no performance anxiety), leaving the conflict strictly internal and contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of "beginning through subtraction" is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("Stories... start in the silence before them") rather than subtext. The characters frequently articulate the story's thesis to one another, reducing the interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is controlled but suffers from uniformity; the dialogue ("voice cracked as old leather") mirrors the narrator's high-poetic register, erasing distinction between characters. The relentless lyrical tone creates a distance that muffles the emotional grit of the "incision."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Metaphor density is excessive ("like glass birds," "like sand," "like frozen music," "like puncture wounds"), often obscuring action with ornament. Repetitive phrasing of prompt words ("incise," "glimmering parole") creates echoes that stall momentum. The prose explains metaphors immediately after introducing them.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "magical shop that trades in memories/abstract qualities" is a familiar speculative trope. While the specific imagery of light-incision is pleasant, the execution relies on standard genre beats without a subversive twist or deep emotional specificity to refresh the premise.</comment>
