<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle between the "void" of ego death and the "ghost" of emotion is compelling and well-dramatized. The transition from numbness to grief is earned through the specific action of the climax, though the "gift" that slices pretense feels slightly convenient as a trait. The emotional cost—the "tanto blade" of grief—is visceral and effectively embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is strong, with a clear inciting incident (timeline fracture) and a resonant decisive change at closure (reintegration). The pacing is tight, and the causality holds well under a hybrid lens where metaphysical actions have physical consequences. The resolution feels inevitable yet surprising in its imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is functional but relies on generic martial arts fantasy tropes ("floating rock dojo"). While the "jar labeled DUPLICATE" is a specific and grounding object, descriptions like "sun of causality" and "canyon of justification" veer into abstraction, weakening the physical immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are high (existence), but the external conflict is somewhat static; the clones merely argue and flicker rather than actively pressuring the protagonist. The urgency is driven more by the environmental "temporal storm" than by the antagonists, missing an opportunity for a more dynamic "custody battle."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of integration versus transcendence is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism. The ending relies on explicit summary statements ("survival meant integration," "duplication was never the problem") rather than letting the dramatic action speak for itself, which significantly flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, authoritative, and meditative, fitting the "sensei" archetype well. The shift in tone from detached observation to emotional vulnerability is handled smoothly, maintaining narrative control throughout the transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with mixed or abstract metaphors ("formaldehyde swirling like liquid time," "sun of causality"). These flourishes distract from the otherwise sharp imagery. The rhythm is good, but the tendency to explain metaphors ("stones melting like ice...") reduces density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi tropes (clones, timeline fracture) with martial arts philosophy is fresh and engaging. The "custody battle" for one's own consciousness is a clever conceptual hook that elevates the prompt elements beyond their standard usage.</comment>
