<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Maya is defined solely by her role and function; she lacks internal contradiction, distinct personality, or emotional cost. Her "weaving truth" decision is a plot mechanic rather than a character-defining choice under pressure, and her reactions are generic (kneeling, whispering, smiling).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the protagonist simply walks to the goal and retrieves it. Causality breaks at the end when a physical object materializes from a dream, undermining the "wreck-diver" reality established in the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting relies on visual clichés ("endless dark," "silver mist") rather than tactile, constraining details. The transition from the glacier shrine to the wreck is spatially vague, and the environment exerts no physical pressure on the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>There are no significant obstacles or stakes; the door opens easily, the ghost cooperates immediately, and the prize is found without struggle. The story lacks escalation, as Maya faces no risk of failure or meaningful trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through repetitive labels ("windows of connection," "pure memory") rather than subtext or action. The narrative explains its own meaning repeatedly, leaving no room for reader interpretation or resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The voice is flattened by the obsessive repetition of prompt phrases, creating a mechanical, template-like cadence. The relentless use of "borrowed starlight" and "windows of connection" drains the narrative of organic rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition artifacts: "borrowed starlight" appears seven times and "windows of connection" four times in a short space, creating a monotonous drone. Purple prose ("ribs jutting like broken promises") and clichés substitute for precise description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>While the "ghost whisperer wreck diver" concept is promising, the execution falls into standard sentimental tropes. The resolution relies on a magical realism convenience (dream object becoming real) that feels unearned.</comment>
