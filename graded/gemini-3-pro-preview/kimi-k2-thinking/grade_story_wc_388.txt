<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias is a competent vehicle for the plot, but his internal life is summarized rather than dramatized. The transition from discovery to high-stakes heroism relies on intellectual processing ("Elias understood now") rather than visceral, embodied struggle or doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, moving from the anomaly in the roots to the realization and final decision. Closure is a functional "Charged Poise" ending (the decision to confront), though the investigative middle relies heavily on summary to bridge the gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the "impossible greenness" of the orchard and the radioactive wasteland is vivid and grounds the story well. Specific details like the "mulberry roots" and "blue flicker of a salvaged LED" add necessary texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high (survival vs. truth), but the antagonist (the council) remains abstract until the final paragraphs. The escalation is logical, though the emotional pressure is often stated ("cost him friends") rather than felt in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus comfortable lies is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("The truth he'd excavated wasn't just about survival..."). The story tends to explain its subtext rather than letting it emerge from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," summarizing complex realizations to speed the plot. The distance is often too great to feel the immediate danger of the radiation or the social ostracization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by "telling" shortcuts ("As he pieced together... a pattern emerged") and awkward prompt insertions ("Sharply observant, he collected..."). These structures flatten the tension of the investigation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a "conspiracy debunker" finding a real conspiracy is strong, but the "bunker for the elite" and "people as shields" reveal is a familiar trope. The execution is competent but doesn't offer a deeply fresh angle on the genre.</comment>
