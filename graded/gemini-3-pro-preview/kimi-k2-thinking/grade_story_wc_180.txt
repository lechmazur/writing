<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is clearly drawn, but the "endearingly feisty" trait acts as a told label rather than a demonstrated behavior; her actions are largely gentle and reflective. The daughter functions as a prop for the thematic resolution, her sudden shift from anger to acceptance lacking earned psychological progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies on convenience (the daughter appearing exactly at the climax) and concludes with a summary that spans years, dissipating the scene's tension. The ending resolves via a "tied up with a bow" explanation rather than a dramatized closure unit with immediate cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of an orchard within cathedral rafters is vivid and anchors the story effectively. Sensory details like the "quartz eyes," "resin," and "moss" create a distinct atmosphere, though the logistics of the soil contract remain slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>External stakes are established, but the internal conflict resolves too easily through dialogue rather than costly action. The daughter's resistance melts instantly upon hearing a moral statement, robbing the climax of genuine friction or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly through the found note and the protagonist's dialogue, leaving little room for subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the lesson ("accidental wisdom") rather than letting it emerge organically from the narrative beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and successfully evokes a fairy-tale tone suitable for the setting. However, the narration occasionally slips into expository "telling" to ensure the reader grasps the emotional significance of the props.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable, though it leans on similes that feel slightly constructed ("tongue as sharp as her chisels"). The forced insertion of the prompt phrase "endearingly feisty" disrupts the natural rhythm of the character description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The central image of the quartz-eye mender in the rafters is imaginative and fresh. However, the mother-daughter reconciliation arc follows a standard, predictable path that relies on familiar sentimental tropes.</comment>
