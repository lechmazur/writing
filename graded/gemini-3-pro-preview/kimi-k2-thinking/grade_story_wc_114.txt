<question>1</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined almost exclusively by abstract labels ("fault-tolerant," "swallowed truth") rather than dramatized psychology. The central realization is unearned; she simply decides to feel peace without a credible internal struggle or contradictory impulse acting in the scene. The emotional arc relies on "therapy-speak" diagnostics ("forgiveness she can finally allow herself") rather than embodied reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Causality is broken by a "soft reset" epiphany; the transition from smudging ink to hallucinating the word "forgive" acts as a magical resolution to the conflict. The action of weighing a piece of paper to find the weight of a secret is a metaphor treated as a literal plot mechanic, which shatters the scene's reality. Closure is achieved by fiat, not consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The setting consists largely of atmospheric lists ("barometers and anemometers") and "aurora" descriptors without constraining the character's choices. The environment feels like a passive backdrop for the character's internal monologue rather than a source of pressure or resources. The "snowfall scale" is used, but primarily as a prop for a metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>There is no escalation or true opposition; the character desires an answer, performs a ritual, and is immediately granted a comforting epiphany. The stakes are purely abstract ("weight of a swallowed truth") and the resolution is painless, lacking any visible or felt cost to the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Subtext is non-existent because the narrative explicitly explains every symbol and theme to the reader ("truth's weight cannot be found in grams, but in the forgiveness"). The story effectively sermonizes its moral in the final paragraphs, reducing the narrative to a delivery vehicle for a platitude about letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is overly helpful, constantly interpreting the character's feelings and the story's symbols for the reader. The tone is consistently melodramatic ("bleed across the peaks," "weaving sorrow") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on high-minded abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Severe repetition artifacts damage the prose; "swallowed truth" appears six times, "auroral sorrow" four times, and "swaying certainties" three times in a short text. The prose is heavy with "purple" descriptors and abstract nouns, lacking the concrete density required for this band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story feels like a mechanical assembly of prompt requirements rather than an organic narrative. The central metaphor of "weighing a secret" is executed with a literalness that feels cliché rather than ingenious, and the "fault-tolerant" concept is never explored beyond its initial mention.</comment>
