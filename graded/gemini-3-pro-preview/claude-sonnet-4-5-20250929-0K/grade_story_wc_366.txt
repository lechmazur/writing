<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera is a coherent focalizer with a clear arc, but her interiority relies on summarized realization ("learning the hidden geography") rather than active contradiction in the moment. The transition from reticence to confession is mechanically earned by the crisis, but the self-diagnostic nature of her letter ("protecting everyone's truth but her own") flattens the psychological complexity into a label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, moving from the supply run to the rescue and the decision to join the letter chain. Orientation and pacing are effective. However, the plot relies on the convenient timing of the lamp failure to force the epiphany, and the mechanism of the letter chain feels slightly contrived as a plot device.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("bone against the sky," "frozen chrysanthemum," "hollow socket") that establishes a strong atmosphere. The sensory details of sardines, oil, and the sea glass ground the abstract emotions in physical reality, effectively constraining the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The external stakes (Marcus’s collapse) are established, but the escalation is undercut when Vera pauses to write a reflective letter while the keeper is in medical distress. This choice prioritizes thematic symmetry over plausible crisis behavior, acting as a soft reset of tension rather than a tightening of the screw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is articulated too explicitly. Vera’s letter functions as a summary of the story’s thesis ("protecting everyone's truth but her own"), which violates the "Thematic Echo" guardrail by stating the moral rather than letting it emerge from subtext. The emotional resonance is forced through explanation rather than earned through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controls the distance well, maintaining a suitably melancholic tone. It leans occasionally into sentimental register ("luminescent ache," "whispered to him"), but the POV remains stable and the focus is disciplined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and readable but suffers from "literary" adjectival clustering ("weathered perfection," "luminescent ache") that feels slightly ornamental. The triad "flickered. Stuttered. Died." is a cliché rhythm that reduces the impact of the moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise relies heavily on well-worn tropes: the lonely lighthouse keeper, the dead wife, the healing sea glass, and the reticent observer. While the "letter chain" offers a slight variation, the execution follows a predictable sentimental template without subverting expectations or offering a fresh perspective.</comment>
