<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s internal arc from desperate searching to acceptance is distinct and drives the ritualistic action effectively. However, the interiority occasionally leans into abstract thematic summaries ("grief no equation could solve") rather than consistently embodied emotion, creating a slight distance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist accepts the "unsolvable" nature of her loss with a felt shift in perspective. The causal chain from the discovery of the prime numbers to the ritual and final vision is consistent and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the stalactites acting as a metronome and the orchard fueling the conjuring in a way that constrains the ritual. Specific details like the "taxidermist's glass eye pair" anchor the surreal environment, though "silver milk" leans slightly purple.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The internal conflict is resolved through a clear moment of renunciation—choosing not to call out to the figure—which earns the shift in stance. The stakes are personal, though the climax remains quiet and internal without a sharp external snag to test the choice further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "ambiguous loss" is resonant, but the story relies on explicit thesis statements ("love could be quantified... by the shape of its absence") rather than letting the imagery do the work. The final paragraph summarizes the moral, reducing the implicit power of the closing image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending mathematical precision with lyrical description to match the protagonist. The register occasionally drifts into abstract density ("dovetailed quantum uncertainty") that briefly obscures the physical immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("silver milk") and weaker constructions ("literally and figuratively"). The use of abstract nouns in action beats ("equations that dovetailed...") slightly muddles the line-level causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematics, subterranean botany, and grief conjuring creates a fresh, specific atmosphere. The use of the glass eyes as a dimensional lens provides a memorable image that successfully elevates the familiar trope of processing loss.</comment>
