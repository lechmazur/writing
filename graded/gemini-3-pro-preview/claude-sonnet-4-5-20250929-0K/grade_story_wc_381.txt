<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct, competent, and driven by a clear burden. The cost of her vocation—eternal loneliness and lack of recognition—is palpable in the closure ("No one would thank her"), satisfying the Earned Stasis model. The "trembling fingers" effectively ground the high-concept stakes in physical vulnerability, though the internal struggle during the ritual itself is resolved relatively quickly through expertise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation and causality are precise; the "magic fix" (the wing) is properly established as the result of months of labor, avoiding a deus ex machina feel. The closure—an Earned Stasis where the threat is neutralized—lands effectively with a conceptual cost (the burden of silence). The narrative arc is tight and economical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the magic system (the brook's ripples allowing the "mapping of silence"). Specific details like "pressed starflowers" and "meteor dust" elevate the fantasy elements without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (chaos vs. silence) is clear, and the tightening occurs when the prophecy actively resists suppression. However, because the summoner is highly competent, the on-page struggle feels somewhat one-sided; the victory is never truly in doubt, lowering the immediate dramatic tension slightly despite the high global stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The thematic inversion of the standard fantasy trope—silencing a prophecy rather than fulfilling it—is excellent and thoroughly explored. The motif of "mapping silence" resonates through the ending, creating a cohesive argument for the value of peace over glory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, fable-like distance that suits the material well. The tone manages to be elevated without becoming archaic, though occasional filters ("she thought of as") slightly distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and lyrical ("silence, like any garden, required constant tending"). However, a few phrases lean into cliché or standard rhetoric ("riddles wrapped in metaphors wrapped in lies"), which detracts slightly from the otherwise fresh imagery of "mapping silence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of an "anti-adventurer" using gentle crafts (origami) to suppress world-shaking events is highly inventive. It offers a fresh, specific angle on prophecy tropes that feels intellectually and emotionally satisfying.</comment>
