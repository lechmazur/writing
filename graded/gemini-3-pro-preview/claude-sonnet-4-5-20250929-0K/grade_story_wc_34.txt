<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Moth is a competent archetype who performs her role without internal friction or contradiction; she lacks a dilemma that would force a character-defining choice. Her interiority is summarized in backstory rather than embodied in the immediate pressure of the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the accumulative structure works, but the resolution arrives without meaningful obstacles or failure risk. The ending feels like a standard procedural completion rather than an earned reconfiguration of the status quo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details ("cloud-condensation," "copper surface") that effectively ground the fantasy concept. The atmospheric pressure of the storm integrates well with the pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active antagonism or internal resistance, and the "ghost" is entirely cooperative. The absence of a visible or felt cost for the success makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of connection is consistent but delivered through on-the-nose statements ("I exist... I am alone") and sentimental resolutions. Subtext is largely replaced by explicit declaration of the ghost's needs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone, though it occasionally drifts into distancing abstraction ("world holds its breath"). The narrative distance feels slightly too remote to fully engage with the urgency of the storm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally functional with some strong images, but marred by awkward prompt-mashing ("driftingly alert awareness") and some cliché ("rolling across the sky like a drum"). Information density is moderate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blend of solarpunk and fantasy elements is imaginative, but the execution remains safe, relying on familiar tropes of empathetic magic without a fresh subversive angle.</comment>
