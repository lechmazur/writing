<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and the backstory integration (Alice/Amelia) effectively shapes the protagonist's worldview. However, interiority relies frequently on diagnostic summary ("broken something fundamental," "hollow recognition") rather than embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound, moving cleanly from discovery to a resonant closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) that feels earned. The causal link between the Earhart discovery and the current resignation is strong, though the "equilibrium" physics are slightly distracting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific, vivid details ("verdigris like underwater flowers") establishing a haunting mood. The setting actively pressures the protagonist's reflection, though the mechanics of the "swaying shelves" and snow globe physics strain credibility slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear (the need for closure vs. acceptance), but the pressure remains low-stakes and purely internal. The resolution comes through intellectual processing rather than a forced choice under pressure, limiting the sense of risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but undercut by explicit moralizing in the climax ("The physics of letting go... was about accepting"). This "telling" of the epiphany flattens the subtext and resolves the ambiguity that the story worked to build.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, sophisticated, and suitably melancholic, matching the protagonist's "quietly analytic" nature. The POV remains stable, filtering the environment effectively through Elena's specific obsession with loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good density and momentum. A few phrases lean toward cliché ("cathedral of loss") or melodrama ("true and insufficient"), but the line-level craft is generally high-quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Combining the Earhart mystery with a personal sunken-ship narrative offers a fresh entry point to the genre. However, the central metaphor—a snow globe representing suspended time—is a familiar trope that limits the story's ingenuity.</comment>
