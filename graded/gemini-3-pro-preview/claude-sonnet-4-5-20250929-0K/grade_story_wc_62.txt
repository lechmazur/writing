<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is largely passive, functioning as a vessel for the ghost's instruction rather than an active agent navigating resistance. The realization ("She understood then") is summarized rather than earned through a high-stakes choice or struggle on the page. Marcus serves as a didactic device to explain the character's flaw and solution, removing the potential for internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a summary montage ("Marcus spent the remaining light teaching her... weeks later") to bridge the inciting incident and the resolution, dissipating immediate scene pressure. This "soft reset" via time compression avoids dramatizing the actual moment of change or difficulty. The closure lands, but the path is paved by summary rather than scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively mirroring the themes of growth and decay ("tomato vines grew wild among cracked Victorian planters"). The sensory details ("pools of copper light") ground the scene well. The setting actively supports the mood, though the time jump dilutes its immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the obstacle is a lack of understanding that is immediately resolved by the ghost's explanation. There is no significant resistance, antagonist, or cost to the protagonist's acquisition of wisdom; she simply accepts the lesson. The stakes remain intellectual and abstract without a concrete test of the protagonist's resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("grief was actually a continuous thread"), leaving little room for subtext. The ending poem ("We are the carvers of each other's remembering") functions as a moral summary, triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing/thematic echo at the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished, with a lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the dialogue leans heavily into "writerly" exposition, with characters speaking in thematic thesis statements rather than natural speech. The POV remains stable, though the interiority is often expository.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with clear imagery and good rhythm ("migration patterns written in orange and black"). While "thundering calm" feels like a forced oxymoron, the general prose quality is high. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("She felt him," "She understood") that distances the reader slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost teaching a living relative about grief in a ruin is a familiar trope executed here with standard sentimental beats. The "collective grief" angle provides a slight variation, but the execution follows a predictable path of supernatural instruction and immediate acceptance.</comment>
