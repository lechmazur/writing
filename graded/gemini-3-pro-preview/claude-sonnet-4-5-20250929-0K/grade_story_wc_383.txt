<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is distinct and compelling, particularly the definition of "Cognitive Contagion" as excessive empathy. Her motivation (preservation over recognition) is challenged and strengthened by the climax, leading to a choice that feels authentically rooted in her "skeptic" characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is excellent; the act of writing the refusal and burying the shell constitutes a Decisive Change with clear conceptual and social cost (loss of legitimacy). The drive lens (Hybrid Causal/Situational) holds firmly from the envelope's introduction to the dawn deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden is a vivid, constrained setting that actively pressures the protagonist. The sensory details ("jagged edge," "luminous," "whispering") support the tone well, though the specific repetition of prompt phrases slightly diminishes the immersive effect of the description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established via the envelope (independence vs. control) and escalated by the approaching dawn. The conflict is primarily internal but externalized effectively through the shell and the letter, forcing a definitive stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves high resonance by reframing "fragmentation" not as brokenness but as a survival strategy against "standardization." The ending offers a non-literal, emotionally potent answer to the central question of cure versus preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific terminology ("resonance structures") with lyrical melancholy. POV control is tight, staying firmly with Mira’s perception and biases throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative, but the verbatim repetition of three distinctive prompt phrases ("velvet garden," "tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") within a short word count reads as a structural artifact rather than a purposeful refrain, creating a scaffold/loop effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of "Cognitive Contagion" as a pathology of empathy is a fresh, sophisticated twist on memory tropes. The synthesis of gardening and archival science creates a unique and memorable premise.</comment>
