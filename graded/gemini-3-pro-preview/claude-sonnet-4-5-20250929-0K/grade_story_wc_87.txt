<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina is a distinct focalizer with clear internal conflict, but her pivotal change relies on a diagnostic realization ("Marina understood then...") rather than an embodied shift under pressure. The integration of prompt phrases creates slight inconsistencies in her internal voice, making some thoughts feel like authorial insertions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The arc is structurally sound with a clear inciting incident and legible closure that reconfigures Marina's stance. The pacing is effective, though the transition from refusal to acceptance is relatively quick and smoothed over by dialogue rather than a forced tactical choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The contrast between the metronomic certainty of the utility poles and the fluid indifference of the ocean excellently grounds Marina's psychological state in the physical world. The compass serves as a strong anchor prop that evolves from a symbol of guilt to a tool of integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established, but the escalation relies largely on Amy's verbal persuasion and shared trauma rather than escalating situational obstacles. The "weather turning" adds nominal urgency but does not force a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of integrating failure is coherent but heavily over-explained through direct statements ("broken navigators gravitate...", "to align heart and action"). The narrative articulates the subtext for the reader instead of allowing the imagery of the poles and compass to carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally stable and reflective, fitting the melancholic tone. However, the voice wobbles when accommodating required phrases, shifting from organic observation to somewhat stiff construction ("merrily melancholic in the way of all beginnings").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is competent but occasionally leans into cliché ("dawn paint the horizon," "sandcastle meeting tide"). Several required phrases are jammed into sentences without sufficient syntactic blending, disrupting the otherwise smooth rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a traumatized expert redeemed by a persistent novice is a familiar trope executed here with standard beats. While the specific detail of the utility poles adds freshness, the overall narrative arc follows a predictable path without significant subversion.</comment>
