<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vera is a competent, distinct protagonist with a clear voice and worldview. However, the pivotal choice to pivot from "obsession" with truth to "guardian of lies" happens too smoothly, lacking the visceral internal struggle required for higher bands. The resolution—planning to publish the science while claiming to leave the miracle intact—creates a slight character logic gap regarding her motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on a "video game log" device: finding shredded papers containing the exact plot explanation and coordinates sitting loosely in a windy wasteland. This contrivance significantly undermines the causal chain; it is implausible that someone trying to hide a secret would shred documents on-site and leave them to be easily reassembled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively blending the "wasteland" and "luminous" elements to support the tone. The sensory detail of the "stillpoint" (absence of nausea) effectively grounds the sci-fi concept in physical sensation. The environment feels distinct and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (truth vs. hope), but the escalation is dampened by the ease of discovery and the swiftness of the resolution. The protagonist faces little external opposition, and the internal cost of compromising her life's work is stated rather than dramatized through difficult hesitation or consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of Science vs. Faith is present but muddled by the resolution: Vera plans to "explain the science" yet "leave the miracle intact," two goals that contradict each other. The ending relies on a summarizing thought to tell the reader the moral ("comfortable lies") rather than letting the action carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, intelligent, and consistent with Vera's analytical nature. The prose texture effectively conveys her perspective, though the mechanics of the puzzle-solving scene feel slightly dry and functional compared to the atmospheric opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is solid, with strong imagery ("poisoned snow," "dark inclusions") and good rhythm. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops, though the exposition within the shredded letters is a bit heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of a flawed diamond creating a radiation "stillpoint" is inventive and fresh. However, the reliance on the tired "shredded document discovery" trope to explain the backstory lowers the ingenuity score significantly.</comment>
