<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Internal conflict is resolved through diagnostic labeling ("value wasn't in the extraordinary, but in attention itself") rather than dramatized struggle. The epiphany feels unearned, relying on abstract summary of emotion rather than embodied reaction, triggering the label-speak penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies on a "soft reset" ending where a single observation solves a thirty-year existential crisis with no visible cost or trade-off. The resolution feels symmetric and tidy, lacking the friction or consequence required for a high-band Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "prism atrium" and "mist" create a vivid, grounded atmosphere that anchors the abstraction. The setting details successfully filter through the glazier’s professional gaze ("fractures invisible to others"), adding necessary specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no external resistance and the internal obstacle dissolves instantly upon throwing a stone. The lack of a "meaningful tightening" or a choice that forecloses a path keeps the stakes abstract and low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("teaching a silent lesson about presence") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation in the final third flattens resonance, violating the "show, don't tell" principle for thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but drifts into authorial philosophy ("liminal hour," "grammar of ordinary things") that distances the reader from Martin’s distinct perspective. The transition from sensory observation to abstract essayism feels seamless but artificial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished but leans on clichés ("colors that had no names," "breath on glass") and metaphor stacks ("language of wave and particle"). The rhythm is smooth, but the imagery often prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over fresh observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "craftsman finds Zen in his trade via nature" trope is executed competently but without a fresh twist or subversion. The epiphany follows a predictable path, offering a safe, standard resolution to the premise.</comment>
