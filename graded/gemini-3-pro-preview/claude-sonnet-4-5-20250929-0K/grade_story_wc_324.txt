<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mira is a competent functionary rather than a dynamic character; she faces no internal opposition, pays no personal cost, and her backstory is summarized rather than dramatized. The "contact tracer" identity is engaging, but she operates as a flawless helper archetype who resolves the external problem without experiencing significant pressure or transformation herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on coincidence (Lily arriving exactly as the signal is decoded) rather than causal progression driven by the protagonist's choices. Closure is neat and administrative ("making calls") with no felt cost or sacrifice on the page, resulting in a low-stakes resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atrium is atmospherically rendered with specific details like the "corroded battery compartment" that ground the speculative elements. However, the opening relies on "bruised hour" and "spilled ink," which are stylistic clichés that detract from the otherwise sharp imagery of the "skeletal ferns" and the hearing aid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pressure is low throughout; the antagonist (the abuser) is a disembodied voice from the past, and Lily’s arrival removes the obstacle of distance immediately. There is no moment where Mira’s goal is genuinely threatened or where she must trade one value for another; she simply performs her job to success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit summation ("That was the thing about hearts...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text explains its metaphors ("not the medical kind") instead of trusting the reader to interpret the speculative conceit, flattening the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a melancholic, lyrical tone appropriate for the genre. However, the POV creates distance by filtering emotional resonance through professional competence, preventing the reader from feeling the raw edge of the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from "adjective-noun" overload in the opening ("bruised hour," "skeletal ferns," "spiderweb shadows") and sentimental abstraction. The sentence "incidental heroism was the only kind that mattered" acts as a scaffold to force the prompt element rather than letting the action speak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central conceit of a "contact tracer for hearts" using a hearing aid is a genuinely fresh and imaginative synthesis of pandemic imagery and ghost story tropes. The execution, however, reverts to a standard "ghost saves victim" structure that doesn't fully exploit the uniqueness of the premise.</comment>
