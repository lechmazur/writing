<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is a coherent focalizer with a clear backstory that informs her worldview, but her internal landscape lacks active contradiction or struggle in the present scene. The transition from crisis actor to historian is intellectually engaging but feels summarized rather than emotionally embodied under pressure. The interaction with the archivist is frictionless; they align immediately without status dynamics or skepticism, resulting in a lack of interpersonal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative structure is a clean, linear vignette that effectively establishes the premise, but the closure relies on an additive "meeting of minds" rather than a decisive change with cost. While the collaboration is a logical endpoint, it feels low-stakes and inevitable; the "interregnum" offers a setting but not a pressure cooker that forces a difficult choice. The ending resonates thematically but lacks the "felt cost" required for a higher-band closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is rendered with evocative, sensory details ("stone ear," "dusty skylights") that ground the abstract concept of "walking words." The atmosphere of the "interregnum" is palpable, blending the decay of the old order with the quiet potential of the new. However, the "nomadic penumbra" remains a somewhat abstract description of the city outside rather than a tangible environmental pressure within the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a dominant stake with visible pressure; Mira’s practice meets no resistance, and the archivist’s arrival leads to immediate validation rather than conflict or complication. The stakes are thematic (memory vs. oblivion) rather than dramatic or situational, and no clear price is paid for the resolution. Without an antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental obstacle to overcome, the narrative drive feels flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of preserving "small gestures" against "grand narratives" is consistent and touching, though the execution leans heavily on explicit statement in dialogue ("Someone needs to remember the small things"). The symbolism of the chessboard is apt but slightly didactic. The story succeeds in creating a "luminous absence," but the subtext is often converted into text, reducing its resonant power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent literary register that suits the contemplative tone. However, the dialogue between Mira and the archivist feels unnatural and stagey ("You're walking words," "They don't capture what actually happened to us"), functioning more as thematic exposition than human conversation. The POV remains firmly with Mira, filtering the world effectively through her historian's lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery ("curved... like a stone ear"). There are moments of "telling" where showing would be more impactful (e.g., the summary of her "benevolently ruthless" documentation in the soup kitchen), but the line-level craft is generally high. No distracting artifacts or loops; the writing is dense and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a whispering gallery, a footstep-based language, and the "interregnum" setting offers a fresh, specific aesthetic. While the "archivist of the apocalypse" trope is familiar, the specific mechanic of walking the gallery adds ingenuity. The story takes few risks, settling for a gentle, affirmative ending rather than a more complex or costly resolution.</comment>
