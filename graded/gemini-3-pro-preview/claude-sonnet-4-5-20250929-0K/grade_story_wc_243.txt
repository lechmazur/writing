<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Maren functions as a passive observer rather than an active protagonist; she witnesses the climax but does not drive it through choice or struggle. Her internal state is summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the resolution is explained to her by other characters rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a linear sequence of arrival and explanation rather than causal pressure; the resolution (the return) feels coincidental to the scene's immediate action. The "why now" logic depends on a mystical schedule rather than the protagonist's agency or a clearly established rule set.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The specific details of the walnut ink and the atmospheric setting of the jetty are strong and grounded. The sensory environment supports the tone well, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes are low and opposition is virtually nonexistent; the central tension of loneliness is resolved by an external event without escalation or trade-off. There is no moment where the protagonist must weigh conflicting values or pay a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("We steep ourselves..."), reducing subtext to text and resulting in a lecture-like resolution. The story relies on characters explaining the meaning of the events rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Narrative and dialogue voices converge into a single poetic register; characters speak in written prose sentences that serve thematic exposition rather than natural speech. The uniformity of voice flattens character distinctness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from abstract labeling ("haunted euphoria") and occasional pathetic fallacy ("flowers... listening"). While the rhythm is generally good, the reliance on telling emotions rather than showing them weakens the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of an archivist grounding a community is promising, but the execution leans on familiar tropes of magical return without a fresh structural twist. The "ghost town coming alive" angle feels safe and lacks a sharp, specific edge.</comment>
