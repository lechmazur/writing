<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clearly established, but the "instant understanding" between her and the Guardian bypasses necessary interpersonal conflict. The lack of friction in their interaction reduces the emotional weight of her struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The resolution relies on a jarring anachronism ("photographed" in a torch-lit guild era) and dubious physics (shadows forming legible maps on moving water). These logic breaks undermine the causal chain of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric details ("cobalt dock," "bruised light") effectively set a moody tone. However, the spatial logistics of the shutter shadows are difficult to visualize, blurring the scene's physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>External pressure is absent from the scene; the Guardian complies immediately, and no antagonist or time constraint actively opposes their work. The "stillwater tension" feels declared rather than dramatized through obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative explicates its themes ("silent empathy made visible," "teach darkness the value") rather than allowing them to emerge from action. This heavy-handed telling flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("weaver of truths"). The perspective stays firmly with Marina, filtering the world through her concern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of "spiralingly calm" creates a distracting artifact. The mention of photography breaks the lexical and world-building consistency of the pre-industrial setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the dental mirror is a unique prop, the "symbolic art defeats political power" resolution is a standard trope. The execution lacks the ingenuity required to make the shadow-map mechanic feel plausible.</comment>
