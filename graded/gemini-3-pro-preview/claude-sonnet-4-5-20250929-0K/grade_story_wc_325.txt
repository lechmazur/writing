<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is a competent, motivated focalizer with clear interiority. However, her claustrophobia functions as atmospheric texture rather than a constraint that forces a difficult trade-off; her path is linear endurance rather than a complex decision under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The scene structure is functional, but scientific and historical logic breaks harm credibility. "Medieval monasteries recording... telegraph lines" is a jarring anachronism, and equating tidal movement with "phase transitions" (vapor/ice) strains the hard-science POV.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like the "exhaling" facility and specific lighting effects. The setting feels distinct, oppressive, and wet, grounding the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ticking clock provides solid external pressure, but the climax is observational rather than active. Mara witnesses the event and takes photos, but does not face a dilemma that costs her something significant beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of "unremembered labor" is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("monument... in understanding"), flattening the resonance that the image alone could have carried.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric. It falters only when the authorial hand intrudes to explain the science or history loosely, momentarily distancing the reader from Mara's expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally rhythmic, but precision suffers in key descriptions. The conflation of medieval history with telegraphs and tides with phase transitions indicates a lack of conceptual rigor at the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core concept of "information ghosts" maintaining physical infrastructure is imaginative and fresh. The framing device of vindicating a disgraced mentor is standard, but the central image elevates the piece.</comment>
