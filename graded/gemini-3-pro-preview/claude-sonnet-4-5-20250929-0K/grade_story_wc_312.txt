<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emris’s "lukewarm" limitation is effectively turned into the narrative's central asset, grounding the resolution in character-specific mechanics. However, his "earnest naivety" and "brittle devotion" are established primarily through summary exposition ("He believed that devotion could substitute...") rather than being dramatized through interaction or resistance in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal logic of the "oversaturated" ocean and the bell’s resonance is distinct and legible, holding the fable-like tone together. The closure is decisive and earned, though the protagonist's deduction of the cosmic imbalance ("He'd figured that much out") occurs in backstory summary, reducing the immediate dramatic weight of that discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The viaduct and the "condensation" are expertly integrated as active mechanical elements of the magic system rather than static backdrops. The specific drip rates (seven/eleven) anchor the fantasy in tangible observation, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly established, and the climax provides a meaningful tightening where the protagonist's specific limitations create tension ("magic guttered and flared"). The conflict is largely internal and technical; while effective, it lacks a dynamic external counter-pressure beyond the passive "imbalance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "lukewarm" competence finding its necessary niche is resonant and tightly woven into the resolution without feeling moralizing. The metaphysical concept of the ocean's debt ("trying to give something back") lands with earned conceptual weight and recontextualizes the setting details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the "plausible impossibility" tone ("frozen river of light"). The shift between the expository middle section and the immediate scene is handled smoothly, maintaining the fable-like distance appropriate for the genre.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively utilizing the "seven and eleven" motif to build cadence without creating repetitive artifacts. Imagery is dense and functional, though a few moments of "telling" in the character introductions slightly lower the density of the early paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inversion of the ocean's role (a full sponge leaking back) is a genuinely fresh concept that transforms a standard fetch-quest setup into something unique. The subversion of the "underdog mage" trope—where weakness is the specific key rather than a hurdle to overcome—feels inevitable and clever. (Capped by Q2).</comment>
