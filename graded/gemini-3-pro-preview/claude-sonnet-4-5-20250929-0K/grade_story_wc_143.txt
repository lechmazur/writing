<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen’s motivation—to preserve the ephemeral—is compelling and sustains the narrative arc. The transition from observer to witness is clear, though the pivotal realization relies on an external prop's inscription rather than purely internal pressure or struggle. The emotional embodiment is generally strong, anchoring the scientific context in human loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure creates effective pressure through the demolition countdown. However, the discovery of microscopic text on the sand grain acts as a thematic shortcut—a coincidence of light and angle that resolves the internal arc too conveniently. The closure is resonant, with the photo capturing the destruction effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the "condemned cathedral" and the moonflowers create a strong contrast between industrial erasure and organic fragility. The sensory details of the "dawning hush" and the specific lighting conditions ground the scene well. The integration of technical details (helium-3, chemical timers) enhances credibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stakes are palpable and escalate naturally as the countdown progresses. The conflict between preservation and inevitable destruction is handled well, with the chemical timing system adding a layer of tactical urgency. The cost—the loss of the mountain—is felt, satisfying the requirement for closure with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing is powerful, but the execution leans toward the didactic. The inscription on the grain ("What we witness, we carry forward") explicitly states the subtext, reducing narrative ambiguity and resonance. The final sentence further over-explains the significance rather than trusting the image to speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, balancing scientific precision with elegiac reflection. The tone matches the "dawnlit melancholy" requirement without slipping into melodrama. The pacing aligns well with the ticking clock mechanism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative ("sky pearled toward dawn"). There are minor lapses into "telling" emotions ("purposefully curious gaze") and a slightly cliché simile ("understanding bloomed like the moonflowers"). The rhythm effectively supports the building tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "crater inspector" memorializing a site before destruction is a fresh take on the preservation trope. The chemical photography method adds a unique, albeit scientifically soft, layer of ingenuity. The synthesis of elements feels organic.</comment>
