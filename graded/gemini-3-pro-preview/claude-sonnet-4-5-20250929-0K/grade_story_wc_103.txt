<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s internal shift from resisting her condition to accepting the "recursive existence" is compelling and well-motivated. However, the exposition of her "retrocognitive" state via a memory of "physicians" feels slightly explanatory rather than dramatized in the present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative creates a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end, recontextualizing the protagonist's trap as a navigable geometry. The cause-and-effect flow from the catalyst (fragment) to the climax (disintegration) is clear, though the pacing of the realization is rapid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "living bridge" setting is visualized with specific, tactile details ("moss-slick spans," "roots... geometric patterns") that actively support the central metaphor. The environment feels essential to the plot rather than just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central stake—stability vs. understanding—is resolved with a tangible cost: the destruction of the photographs. The escalation is coherent, though the moment of decision happens quickly; the trade-off is felt and changes her tactical relationship to time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story successfully marries the abstract concept of "hyperbolic geometry" with the emotional reality of memory and loss. The theme of time as a non-linear architecture emerges organically from the specific imagery of the mazes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly melancholic and analytical tone that suits a surveyor of time. POV control is stable, effectively filtering the surreal events through Lyra's specific expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative and rhythmically sound ("stone skipping across water"). However, the phrase "hands trembling in quaking reverie" creates a tautological stumble during a pivotal beat, slightly marring the climax's precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, living architecture, and hyperbolic geometry creates a distinct and memorable conceptual framework. The story avoids generic time-travel tropes by grounding them in specific design principles.</comment>
