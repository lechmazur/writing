<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sera’s transition from defensive tension to "bracing against peace" creates a strong, character-specific emotional arc. The "math of mercy" is well-integrated into her worldview, driving the conflict between her past logic and present bodily reality without devolving into stock trauma tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative traces a clear arc from isolation to connection, ending with a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's stance. While the mentor's explanation is slightly expository, the closure lands with the tangible cost of surrendering her defensive mask and accepting a new, terrifying peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The proprioceptive description of the forest ("sap moved through cambium") creates a unique, visceral atmosphere that specifically leverages the sci-fi conceit. The setting is not just a backdrop but the active mechanism for the protagonist's perceptual shift and final choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Internal stakes are high, but the external conflict is resolved somewhat easily by the mentor's convenient presence and readiness to explain the solution. However, Sera's final choice to unclip the mask provides a necessary moment of active agency and vulnerability to anchor the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central question of quantifying mercy is compelling, though the dialogue "Mercy has no formula" tilts slightly into explicit moralizing. The ending image successfully grounds this abstract theme in the physical act of rooting, offering a resonant answer rather than just a statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice successfully filters the world through Sera's mathematical and traumatized lens, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature. The shift from calculating pain to calculating growth is reflected in the observational texture without breaking the established POV distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose achieves high information density with strong imagery ("bioluminescent veins," "symphony of proportion") that serves the story's logic. Rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the protagonist's shift from jagged pain to harmonic perception.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical obsession, torture recovery, and botanical geometry creates a fresh, specific narrative frame. The "old master" trope is elevated and transformed by the unique proprioceptive context of the characters' shared experience.</comment>
