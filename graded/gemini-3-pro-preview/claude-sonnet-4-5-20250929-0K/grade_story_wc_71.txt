<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, but her obsession is diagnosed via a "therapist" mention rather than dramatized through costly behavior. The epiphany feels intellectually delivered rather than emotionally earned; the internal shift is stated ("Mara understood then") rather than shown through a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The structure is coherent and linear, functioning as a "just-so" story of magical ritual. However, the resolution relies on a convenient magical response from the house rather than causal pressure, making the closure feel like a gift rather than a consequence of struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are strong, particularly the "hedges creeping" and the specific smells of the orris root. The setting actively contributes to the mood, though the "dreaming streetlights" borders on pathetic fallacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretical; there is almost no opposition or friction. Mara wants to wake the house, performs the ritual without obstacle, and succeeds immediately. The lack of a visible price or risk keeps the narrative tension flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily didactic. The penultimate paragraph explicitly lectures the reader on the story's meaning ("houses didn't need people... They needed witness"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent—reverent, quiet, and observational. It occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("inadvertently profound," "sanctify these hollow spaces") that feels slightly precious but fits the protagonist’s worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished but relies on filter verbs ("She felt it," "Mara understood") and explicit telling during key moments. The phrase "inadvertently profound" is a clunky adverb-adjective stack that distances the reader from the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of "healing houses with trash" is charming but executed with extreme safety. It reads as a gentle, low-stakes vignette that avoids the complexity or weirdness that could make the concept memorable.</comment>
