<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina is clearly motivated and her internal conflict (dual allegiance) is well-defined. However, her pivotal decision to "reorganize everything" occurs in narrative summary rather than as a dramatized micro-choice under pressure, which distances the reader from her agency at the crucial moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on exposition and summary to bridge the gap between the inciting incident (developers) and the resolution (successful resistance). The middle section ("Within weeks...") summarizes the conflict rather than dramatizing it in a scene, violating the rubric's preference for scenic causality and reducing narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with specific sensory details like "brackish waters," "fried dough," and "artisanal coffee floats" grounding the world. The environment meaningfully constrains the characters and shapes the method of resistance (graffiti on interconnecting platforms).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the stakes (cultural survival) are clear, the central conflict is resolved through summary narration ("the community began to shift") rather than on-page struggle. The lack of a dramatized confrontation or a moment where the plan nearly fails makes the victory feel inevitable and low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of living culture vs. preservation is coherent but stated explicitly by the narrator near the end ("culture wasn't something to be preserved in amber"). This didactic explanations flattens the subtext and reduces the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the raft city. It maintains a stable POV, though the reliance on internal explanation ("Marina understood," "she knew exactly") creates a slight psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic on the sentence level. However, the heavy use of filter verbs and summary telling ("That's when Marina decided," "She felt the hopeful desperation") drags on the momentum and reduces immediate immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a raft city carnival resisting gentrification through coded graffiti is fresh and imaginative. The specific synthesis of these elements feels original, even if the structural execution relies too much on summary.</comment>
