<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, but her internal landscape lacks the friction of contradictory impulses; she functions more as a benevolent archetype than a flawed individual. The client’s breakthrough feels smoothed over, lacking the resistance or behavioral setbacks that would make the resolution feel earned rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent but lacks a "felt cost" or decisive turning point; the resolution (Thomas speaking) arrives as a gift of the setting rather than a hard-won consequence of choice. The closure is a "pure win" without the necessary sacrifice or trade-off to satisfy the rubric’s requirement for high-stakes literary closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting is established with effective sensory details like the "sharp perfume" of sage and the "twilight" quality of the eclipse. While the atmosphere supports the tone well, some descriptors (e.g., "hush of dreaming roots") lean towards the flowery, slightly distancing the reader from the physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Conflict is low-voltage; the obstacle of selective mutism dissolves without significant struggle or complication, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral. The protagonist’s agency is limited to "holding space," which results in a lack of narrative propulsion or meaningful escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated ("teaching others to notice when the world revealed its hidden frequencies") rather than allowed to emerge organically. The ending relies on moralizing summary ("Perhaps that was the real magic"), which flattens the resonance and violates the rubric’s guardrail against sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately mellow, fitting the therapist persona, but suffers from "therapy-speak" and sentimental abstractions ("space between notes where ordinary magic breathed"). The POV filters the world through a lens of soft acceptance that dulls the dramatic edge of the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but overly reliant on abstract metaphors ("wonder lived in subtle frequencies," "pocket of possibility") that tell rather than show. There is a lack of muscularity in the key beats, with the writing leaning into safe, adjectival descriptions ("delicate curl," "fragile emergence") rather than concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story follows a predictable "healer cures wounded child" trajectory without subverting the trope or offering a fresh structural angle. The execution is competent but adheres to a standard, sentimental formula that lacks the risk-taking required for high-band scores.</comment>
