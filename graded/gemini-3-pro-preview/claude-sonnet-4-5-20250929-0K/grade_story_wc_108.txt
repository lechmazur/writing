<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya is a functional protagonist, but her interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("claustrophobia," "adaptive survival instincts") rather than dramatized experience. The connection between her backstory and the present crisis is stated explicitly rather than felt through subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot pivots on a phone call where the antagonist explains the entire twist via exposition ("I encrypted the truth..."), which deflates tension. The pivotal decoding moment is rushed with a convenient "suddenly" realization rather than a process of discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "children's medical library" is a specific, atmospheric setting that grounds the scene well. The physical details of the cast and the rusted beams create a solid sensory environment, though the "dying beast" simile is slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the "consortium" remains a vague, abstract threat that never applies direct pressure in the scene. The resolution—calling the authorities—feels bureaucratic and low-cost given the established danger of the enemy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Vulnerability wasn't just power..."), which flattens resonance. The parallel between Maya and Emma is explained to the reader rather than allowed to emerge organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a thriller tone, though it occasionally slips into melodrama. The dialogue carries too much expository weight, sounding like plot conveyance rather than natural speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by abstractions ("adaptive survival instincts") and convenience transitions ("suddenly"). The "dying beast" imagery borders on purple prose, and the pacing drags during the phone exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core conceit of encrypted data on a child's cast is inventive and memorable. However, the "stunt double turned PI" and the "evil research consortium" are standard tropes that aren't sufficiently transformed.</comment>
