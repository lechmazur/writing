<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren functions as a consistent vessel for the premise but lacks internal friction or contradiction; her "brazen calm" is static from the inciting diagnosis to the end. There is no "crucible" moment where her values are tested against her mortality; she simply accepts and executes. The emotional arc is flat because the character enters the story already fully resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies on a six-month summary montage ("She rewired seventeen oak branches," "By her final week") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. This violates the short-form scope default (single scene or two shards) and distances the reader from the stakes. The narrative summarizes the transformation instead of showing the difficulty of the work in real-time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "pillars of living limestone" and "mycorrhizal networks" are specific, vivid, and causal. The physical properties of the temple dictate the protagonist's actions and the logic of the resolution. The environment effectively constrains the work Maren must do.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The conflict is linear and lacks obstacles; Maren faces no setbacks in her rewiring, and the ecosystem responds immediately and perfectly to her efforts. The stakes (death) are established early, but the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs makes the escalation feel inevitable rather than earned. The "brazen calm" removes the tension of the ticking clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final diary entry ("The temple taught me that we don't care for nature..."), reducing the narrative resonance to a direct moral lesson. This violates the subtext rule; the story articulates its thesis rather than letting it emerge from the dramatic action. The ending tells the reader exactly what to feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a tone of reverence. However, the reliance on summary ("Maren noticed changes," "she understood") keeps the narrative distance too high for deep engagement. The voice describes the experience rather than embodying it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and descriptive but leans heavily on filter verbs and summary reporting ("Birds... suddenly appeared," "The pillars seemed to pulse"). The phrase "brazen calm" is repeated as a label rather than demonstrated through distinct micro-choices. The density is good, but the lack of scenic immediacy flattens the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of biological science (mycorrhizal networks) with sacred architecture is a fresh and compelling concept. However, the "dying caretaker" trope is executed conventionally, and the lack of narrative risk-taking or structural ingenuity limits the score. The story plays it safe with a linear, fable-like structure.</comment>
