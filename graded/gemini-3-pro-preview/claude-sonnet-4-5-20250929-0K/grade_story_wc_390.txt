<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meris is competent and drives the action, but her internal state relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("logically assembling," "fleshly ethereal knowing") rather than embodied complexity. The shift from engineer to mystic feels abrupt, and the final emotional certainty is stated rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient with a clear causal chain and high-stakes closure that lands with the cost of guardianship. The arrival of the boat is a functional if slightly convenient pressure mechanism, but the resolution—locking the key to her heartbeat—provides a legible Decisive Change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The acoustic/ice setting is vivid and distinct, grounding the magical realism in pseudo-technical detail ("resonance chamber," "iron teeth"). The atmosphere is strong, though the physical geography of the marina itself is less distinct than the lighthouse interior.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established early and escalate with the arrival of the antagonist. The cost is felt—Meris binding her physical rhythm to the lock—though the antagonist remains a faceless device to force the timing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory and protection is coherent, but the execution leans toward explicit moralizing at the end ("held back the darkness of forgetting"). The resonance comes more from the concept than the character's specific emotional journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("groaned its twilight song," "fleshly ethereal knowing"). The use of "literally" in narration to emphasize a physical sensation disrupts the established elevated register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from reliance on adjective-noun pairings and abstract summaries of state ("logically committed, emotionally certain"). These telling artifacts flatten the immediate physical experience of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering with sonic absolution is a fresh, engaging premise. The resolution (heartbeat as key) is a familiar trope, but it fits the established logic of the world well enough to satisfy.</comment>
