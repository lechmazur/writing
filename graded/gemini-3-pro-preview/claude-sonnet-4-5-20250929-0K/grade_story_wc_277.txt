<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Celeste’s internal logic is compelling, seamlessly blending her personas as astronomer and heiress to drive the narrative. The shift from doubt to admiration is earned through a specific intellectual process ("proof by contradiction"), though the emotional resolution feels slightly smoother and less costly than the "heaviness" of the setup implies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "proof by contradiction" method provides a sturdy causal spine, turning an abstract logic puzzle into a concrete investigation. The closure—deciding to publish based on the realization that the retraction was a strategic trap—lands with high clarity and repurposes the father's apparent failure into victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory is not merely a backdrop but the primary lens through which the protagonist processes the conflict; the copper instruments, the dome, and the "whispers" ground the abstract logic in tangible, atmospheric detail. The setting actively shapes the "orbit of regret" metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the intellectual stakes are high, the external pressure remains distant (a phone call three hours ago), making the conflict feel somewhat insulated. The resolution arrives via deduction without a moment of visceral risk or sacrifice in the present scene, though the conceptual repricing of the father's legacy is distinct.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "orbit of regret" metaphor successfully unifies the astronomical setting with the narrative arc. The final transformation of the circle to an ascending spiral offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the high-altitude, reflective setting. The transition from the memory of the call to the present investigation is handled smoothly, maintaining a stable POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and generally dense, though it occasionally dips into purple phrasing ("ink the color of midnight between stars," "creature waking from ancient sleep"). These artifacts slightly dull the otherwise sharp precision of the "devotedly observant" voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Synthesizing celestial mechanics with a journalistic cold-case offers a fresh angle on the "legacy of a dead parent" trope. The specific twist—that the retraction was a legal trap—is a clever, non-obvious synthesis of the story's elements.</comment>
