<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Keiko is grounded by specific details of her caretaking past ("spooning soup into cracked lips"), giving her motivation emotional weight. However, her internal arc is resolved primarily by the mentor figure explaining the lesson to her, rather than Keiko earning the realization through an active choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, with clear orientation and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the protagonist accepts a new paradigm. The causality follows a dream-logic typical of fables, which works for the genre, though the resolution relies heavily on a sudden supernatural reveal rather than cumulative narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is established with atmospheric specificity ("breathing mist," "bamboo leaves"), supporting the ethereal tone effectively. The physical details of the offerings and the grotto ground the metaphysical dialogue in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes of internal peace and unresolved grief are clear and escalate through the dialogue to the reveal of the mother's face. The resolution—accepting that seeking is the source—carries a conceptual cost (the loss of a final destination), though the emotional price is mitigated by the comforting nature of the wisdom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story relies on an explicit sermon to deliver its theme ("the source you seek is the seeking itself"), which triggers the penalty for summarizing the thesis in dialogue at the climax. This didactic approach flattens the subtext, replacing earned resonance with a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like content. The POV remains securely with Keiko, effectively filtering the supernatural elements through her specific emotional history.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery. A noticeable repetition of "impossible" (impossible place/impossible length) in early paragraphs and a template-cadence triple simile at the closure ("like a heartbeat, like a promise, like the next breath") detract slightly from the finish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story executes the "sage on the mountain who is actually a loved one" trope competently but follows a very familiar pattern. While the specific imagery of scalloping the bay adds freshness, the core narrative arc and lesson feel safe and standard.</comment>
