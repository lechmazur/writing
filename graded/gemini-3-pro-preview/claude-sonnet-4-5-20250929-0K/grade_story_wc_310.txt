<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on stated traits rather than conflicting impulses in scene. Kael’s swift transition from "stellar doubt" to "Teach me" removes relational friction too easily, missing an opportunity to test Mira's conviction against genuine resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal logic of "backwards prophecy" serves the drive lens well, and the pivot to "instruction" is a strong conceptual turn. However, the climax compresses the three-day countdown into a summary montage, flattening the tension just as the stakes peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "amber light" provides a strong, consistent atmospheric anchor that evolves with the narrative pressure. The tactile specificity of the coins and the auditory "static bursts" effectively ground the abstract high-concept setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the external stakes are existential, the interpersonal conflict evaporates instantly with Kael's conversion. The final cost—the loss of human form—is conceptual and high, but the lack of struggle to accept it makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parallel between extinct civilizations' currency and humanity's final transformation creates deep resonance. The shift from prediction to instruction offers a satisfying, non-literal answer to the story's central question about entropy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the sci-fi tone. However, dialogue is often stiff and expository ("Instruction for what?"), and the verbatim insertion of the motivation phrase ("wavelength align with purpose") feels unnatural in speech.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery is precise and evocative ("violent and clarifying," "death rattle"), with good rhythmic control. The prose is dense and avoids scaffold, though the awkward phrasing required by the prompt slightly disrupts the flow in dialogue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of divination (coins) with hard physics (entropy, static) creates a fresh angle on the cosmic collapse trope. The "backwards causality" mechanic is executed with specific, novel details rather than generic technobabble.</comment>
