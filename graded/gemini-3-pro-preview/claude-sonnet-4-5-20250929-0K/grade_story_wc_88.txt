<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict is clear, but the pivot from guilt to the decision to "try" happens rapidly without deep emotional friction on the page. The "cost" of abandoning his quest for the past is intellectualized rather than viscerally felt, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on a static dialogue block to deliver the time traveler backstory, stalling momentum. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, it hinges on an external anecdote rather than a pressure cooker created by the immediate scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively mirroring Marcus's internal darkness. The "delicately robust" description feels forced, but the bioluminescence serves as a functional metaphor for the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (identity/redemption), but the escalation is conversational rather than dramatic. The pressure comes entirely from the Interpreter's exposition, lacking a tightening of options through action until the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly written on the baseball ("Empathy isn't memory. It's choice."), violating the show-don't-tell principle for resonance. This "thesis statement on a prop" flattens the subtext into a moral lesson rather than an emergent truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and somber, fitting the noir-sci-fi tone. However, the Interpreter functions largely as an exposition delivery system, lacking a distinct voice beyond the "mysterious oracle" archetype.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good rhythm. "Delicately robust" is an awkward oxymoron that disrupts the description, likely due to prompt insertion. The ending image is strong, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into sermonizing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of noir amnesia and time-travel artifacts is imaginative but feels like a checklist of disparate elements. The "lesson from the future" is a familiar trope that isn't sufficiently transformed by the specific character dynamics.</comment>
