<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lena’s agency is distinct, driving the plot through professional risk-taking (chipping the plaster) that aligns with her established motivation. However, the "dreaming" aspect of her interiority feels slightly convenient as a bridge to the surreal elements rather than deeply embodied prior to the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from the acoustic anomaly to a decisive physical action with permanent consequences for the art. Closure lands effectively as a Decisive Change (destroying the surface to reveal the depth), though the final "wake or dream" ambiguity softens the impact slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not just scenery but a necessary tool that constrains the protagonist's method and catalyzes the discovery. The sensory interplay between the "dead pigment" and the "living sound" creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that grounds the magical realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tension between preservation (methodical documentation) and discovery (destruction) provides a clear internal stake. While the external pressure (authorities) is abstract, the immediate sensory pressure of the garden and the mystery successfully escalates the choice to damage the wall.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recursive theme is executed well visually, but the subtext is flattened by having the thematic thesis ("To know is to sleep...") written explicitly on the wall in gold leaf. This didactic moment resolves the ambiguity too neatly, telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a suitable distance that balances professional expertise with wonder. The shift from technical observation to surreal acceptance is handled smoothly without breaking the established POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally lucid, but relies on a few stock similes ("lodged... like a splinter," "nested like Russian dolls") that dampen freshness. The repetition of the tag "methodically playful" functions as a frame but feels slightly mechanical rather than deepening the trait.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic architecture and visual restoration offers a fresh, specific angle on the "hidden layers" trope. While the recursive "Droste effect" ending is a familiar device in this genre, the auditory catalyst gives it a distinct and memorable texture.</comment>
