<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("instrument of both her salvation and her enlightenment") rather than embodied emotion. The protagonist's self-awareness feels overly articulate and therapeutic for the crisis context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative is heavily unbalanced toward backstory and reflection (~60%+), violating the BRR guideline and reducing the present frame to a static walk. The "Decisive Change" at the end feels like a soft reset arrived at via summary rather than pressurized on-page choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is visually grounded with specific details ("aspens," "charred stumps"), though the "celestial bodies" description feels slightly ornamental. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conflict is largely retrospective; the present timeline lacks active resistance or escalation, relying on a "realization" structure. The stakes are declared in memory rather than tested against an immediate obstacle on the ridge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated ("The moon illuminated a truth he'd been avoiding") rather than emerging from subtext. The climax relies on an uncredited paraphrase of a Leonard Cohen lyric ("crack... where light got in"), which undercuts thematic originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, but the voice often slides into authorial poetry ("ancient choreography," "patient inevitability") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished but marred by significant clichés and borrowed phrasing (the "light gets in" line). The reliance on abstract phrases ("hard softness") weakens the line-level impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The arc of a scarred stoic choosing family over duty is a standard trope, and the execution offers few fresh subversions. The reliance on the familiar "cracked pot/light" metaphor feels derivative.</comment>
