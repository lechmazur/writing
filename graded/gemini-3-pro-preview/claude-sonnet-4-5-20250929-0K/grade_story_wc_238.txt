<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Margot's backstory as a gossip columnist integrates well, but the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I was just scared—of being ordinary") rather than embodied vulnerability. She psychoanalyzes herself to the ghost in the peak beat, which flattens the emotional reality into a transaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, but the resolution—instantly deleting an old article from "every archive" via a phone in a barn—strains plausibility and feels like a soft reset. The digital mechanics undercut the supernatural weight, resolving a fifteen-year haunting with a few taps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is excellent; the "dust and decades" and the specific sensory details (Brahms mixed with Billie Holiday) ground the scene. The perfume bottle serves as a strong micro-setting anchor that constrains the manifestation effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and the ticking clock (developers arriving tomorrow) provides effective pressure. The conflict escalates nicely from silence to the "paper storm," though the resolution comes a bit too easily once Margot decides to act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" and the weight of words resonates well in the final image of the out-of-season blossoms. The "frozen river" metaphor connects the protagonist's internal state to the external conflict efficiently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and confident, blending the technical language of the exorcism ("induced currents") with the lyrical tone of the setting. The POV remains tightly controlled on Margot throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong rhythm. There are minor instances of slightly purple phrasing ("grief made tangible," "jasmine and regret"), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal grit tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a gossip columnist turned exorcist who corrects "bad press" for the dead is fresh and engaging. The execution leans a bit on standard tropes at the end, but the core synthesis of ideas is original.</comment>
