<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's unique physiology (mercury-glass) is brilliantly integrated with her internal conflict of reflection versus refraction. Her motivation to find "the shape of home" drives the narrative clearly. The backstory of parents with "narrow minds" feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of her present condition, but the final choice to integrate the stone is a strong, earned character beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving from stasis to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist physically alters her nature. The causality of the feather "materializing" in her hand is a slight convenience that relies on the dream logic of the setting rather than active discovery, but the closure—pressing the stone into her chest—is a definitive, costly action that firmly resolves the central tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both a physical space and a psychological mirror that actively participates in the closure. The "mountain that breathed paper" and the "mercury-glass" skin are vivid, high-concept details that charge the final image of refraction. The environment effectively constrains and then reflects the character's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The internal stakes are high and palpable, escalating from the pain of remembering to the "exquisite pain" of integration. While the external opposition is minimal, the internal pressure is coherent and intensifies appropriately through the interaction with the stone and feather. The climax delivers a meaningful deepening of the character's state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "reflection vs. refraction" as a metaphor for self-actualization is effectively dramatized. The explicitly stated realization ("She had been trying to understand the shape of home") slightly undercuts the power of the imagery, which had already conveyed this idea more subtly. The thematic resolution is nevertheless resonant and complete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the surreal subject matter. The rhythm is generally strong, though a few descriptors ("colors that had no names") feel like placeholders rather than the specific, fresh observations found elsewhere in the piece (e.g., "dust that tasted of forgotten civilizations").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished but marred by several specific clichés ("narrow house with narrow minds," "more true than truth itself," "colors that had no names") that dampen the impact of otherwise strong imagery. These phrasing choices lower the distinctiveness of the line-level craft despite the strong rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a mercury-glass seer is a fresh and visually arresting take on the oracle archetype. While the "magical library" setting is a familiar trope, the specific synthesis of the protagonist's reflective skin with the book-filled mountain creates a unique and memorable aesthetic.</comment>
