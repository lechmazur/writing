<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is consistent but defined by labels ("dry wit," "subtly confident") rather than demonstrated action; the "wit" is a mild correction, not wit. Motivation is clear, but the lack of internal doubt or interpersonal friction leaves the character functioning as a plot device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible and the closure (departure to the ice) qualifies as a Decisive Change. However, the total lack of obstacles—the colleague agrees instantly, the data aligns perfectly—lowers the narrative pressure significantly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details (ice crystals, condensation patterns) ground the setting effectively. The environment feels lived-in, though the "worrying tranquility" is told rather than evoked through sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; Petrov acts as an enabler rather than an obstacle, and the environment presents no immediate on-page threat. The stakes are high in concept (redrawing maps) but low in dramatic execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of empiricism versus myth is coherent and fits the premise. It relies somewhat on explicit statements ("myths start somewhere") rather than emerging purely from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable but relies on distancing filter verbs ("Mira watched," "Petrov studied"). The verbatim repetition of descriptor phrases suggests a lack of control over the narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Significant prose artifacts: the phrases "worrying tranquility" and "subtly confident" are repeated verbatim within a short span, signaling a lack of revision. These loops distract from the imagery and break immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "single source of all rivers" concept is imaginative, pushing into magic realism, but the execution is a standard outpost-discovery procedural. The potential for a unique mythic tone is flattened by the repetitive prose.</comment>
