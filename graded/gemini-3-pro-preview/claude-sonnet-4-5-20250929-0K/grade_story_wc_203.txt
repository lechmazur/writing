<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus is a competent professional with a consistent voice, though his motivation ("daughter asked him") feels expository rather than dramatized under pressure. His interaction with the ghost as a "client" effectively establishes his worldview and character without needing excessive backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and linear, moving efficiently from the inciting incident to a clear resolution (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the protagonist accepts a new burden. The causality is functional, though the discovery of the hidden object feels slightly convenient and lacks significant obstacles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("exhaled must," "warped and split," "soft electric sigh"). The atmosphere of abandonment effectively mirrors the theme of forgotten histories, grounding the supernatural elements in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are relatively low; the conflict is primarily atmospheric rather than urgent or dangerous. While the protagonist chooses to help the ghost over his paid work, the lack of external pressure or a ticking clock makes the escalation feel gentle and "cozy" rather than tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory and preservation are coherent, but the story relies on explicit summarization ("Marcus understood that some burdens...") to convey its meaning. This didactic approach in the final paragraphs flattens the subtext, telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the imagery resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and appropriately reflective for the character's temperament. The narrative voice balances technical observation with supernatural acceptance well, maintaining a steady, melancholic tone throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with some evocative phrasing ("soft electric sigh"), though it occasionally drifts into overwritten abstraction ("weight distribute across his palms like a prayer"). The technical description of the dust patterns provides a nice, grounding counterweight to the spectral elements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of a blue-collar worker interacting casually with the supernatural is engaging but resolved through familiar tropes. The "hidden treasure in the ceiling" and the "ghost finds peace through a promise" beats are executed competently but lack a surprising or subversive twist.</comment>
