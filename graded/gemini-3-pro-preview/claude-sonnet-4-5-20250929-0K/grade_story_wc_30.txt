<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris functions effectively as a mentor archetype, though her internal conflict is largely resolved prior to the scene, making her somewhat static. Her backstory as a fisherman provides nice texture, but the emotional heavy lifting is outsourced to the visitor rather than the focal character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is sturdy, linking the visitor's distress to the library's function and the final resonant reconfiguration. The ending lands a clean closure effect, re-contextualizing the "loop" through the scroll, though the resolution comes with relatively low resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's standout feature, blending the mechanical (gears) with the organic (tides) to create a vivid, specific atmosphere. The sensory details of the melting IDs and the moon-silvered water are excellent, though the score is capped at 8.8 per the Q2 threshold rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and conceptual (wonder vs. routine), anchored by the physical cost of smelting the identity documents. While the pressure is coherent, the conflict is gentle; the visitor accepts the reconfiguration without significant struggle or reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme is beautifully illustrated through the mobile and the gears, but the dialogue explicitly articulates the thesis ("wonder needs only the unknown, not the future"). This thematic echo reduces the subtextual power of the ending, triggering a deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the magical realism tone well. There are occasional drifts into abstract adjectival description ("serenity of winter sunlight") that distance the reader slightly from immediate sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is strong and the imagery is evocative, particularly the description of the "migrating identities." The writing is dense and economical, with only minor reliance on slightly worn phrasings like "economical yet graceful."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "no-tomorrow" time loop with a tidal library and the smelting of future-identities creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. It successfully transforms familiar tropes into a distinct vision.</comment>
