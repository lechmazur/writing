<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naia’s agency drives the scene effectively, contrasting well with Cassius’s established ennui. However, Cassius’s internal state relies heavily on the "bored immortal" trope without fresh particularity until the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, using the storm and fragment to force a decisive climax. Closure is strong, offering a distinct conceptual repricing where Cassius moves from boredom to obsessive determination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "escondite" and magnetic visuals create a vivid backdrop that actively constrains options, satisfying the high-band requirement. The setting is integral to the mechanics of the exit, though some descriptors lean towards abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Conflict generates genuine pressure, forcing a permanent separation with visible emotional cost. The stakes are raised effectively by the time constraint of the solar storm, leading to an earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The exploration of immortality avoids simple moralizing, culminating in a resonant refusal of acceptance. The final image of Cassius plotting to tear reality apart recontextualizes his grief as a new, dangerous purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("hushed thunder"). Narrative distance is controlled, but the "ancient" tone sometimes feels slightly performative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Filter verbs ("Cassius felt," "he could see") repeatedly distance the reader from the sensory experience in key moments. While rhythmically competent, the prose relies on standard genre phrasing ("writhing serpents," "impossible geometries") that dulls impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "spatial mutiny" concept offers a fresh mechanic for the dimensional travel trope. While the setup is familiar, the ending's shift from mourning to destructive scientific ambition provides a satisfyingly original character turn.</comment>
