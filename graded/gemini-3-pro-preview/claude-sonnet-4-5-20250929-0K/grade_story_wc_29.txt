<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara’s competence is established early and drives the plot, but she lacks internal contradiction or genuine vulnerability; the victory feels earned by expertise rather than a difficult micro-choice with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The causal arc is clear and the closure—a shift from chaos to negotiation—is legible, but the resolution leans on convenience as the antagonist capitulates to the protagonist's first counter-move without a mid-climax complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory anchoring is strong, with details like "fillings ache" and "charts... suspended in a moment of weightlessness" effectively grounding the cosmic stakes in the immediate physical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>While the declared stakes (city-wide chaos) are high, the on-page pressure is low; the tricksters function more as a puzzle than an active opposition, reducing the tension of the final confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of reality-as-game is well-integrated, and the ending ("outwitting... one frequency at a time") offers a resonant, non-tidy image of ongoing maintenance rather than total victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally relies on expository summary ("They were ancient and bored, she'd concluded") rather than dramatizing the deduction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose manages density well ("ethereal grit"), but the climax is softened by filter verbs ("Mara felt," "she knew") that place distance between the reader and the physical sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of university radio culture with cosmic horror tropes is fresh, and framing the conflict as a playful negotiation rather than a war adds ingenuity to the premise.</comment>
