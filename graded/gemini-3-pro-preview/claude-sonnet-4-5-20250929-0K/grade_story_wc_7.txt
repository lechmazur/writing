<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mara functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal contradiction or flaws; her choices are low-stakes and her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a broad summary bridge to bypass the actual conflict of establishing the rebellion, resolving the central tension off-page without a dramatized climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and grounded; details like "rust-flaked soil" and "corroded glass" create a strong textural contrast with the celestial and magical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Escalation is mostly summarized; the antagonist (the authorities) remains abstract and is defeated by the "cannot arrest everyone" logic without exerting pressure on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Themes are articulated through explicit thesis statements ("industrialized even memory") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The fable-like narrative voice is consistent and clear, though it struggles slightly to integrate the required scientific jargon naturally into the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable, but relies on "telling" (e.g., "informally wise") and filter verbs that distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The solarpunk concept of growing memory-fruit to resist a gray dystopia is a familiar trope, and the "gentle victory" arc lacks a fresh or risky twist.</comment>
