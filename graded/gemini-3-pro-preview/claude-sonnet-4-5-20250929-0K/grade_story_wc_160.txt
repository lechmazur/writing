<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, active protagonist whose engineering skills drive the plot. While the grandfather memory serves as a convenient moral anchor and the internal reaction to the glue ("trembled... like voltage") feels slightly melodramatic, her final choice to leave the letter unsealed is a strong, character-specific exercise of agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the adhesive investigation to the engineering solution. The closure unit—leaving the letter unsealed—is a decisive, risky action that effectively forces a resolution, satisfying the drive lens with a distinct change in the status quo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater is a vivid, functional setting that constrains the central floodgate problem. The "breathing" motif (exhaled, breathe, expanding ribs) establishes a strong atmosphere, though its frequent recurrence verges on over-saturation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between preservation and safety. The resolution avoids a simple binary by utilizing the protagonist's specific skills, and the "unsealed letter" adds a necessary layer of social risk and cost to what might otherwise be a purely technical fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of harmonizing conflicting values is integrated well, though the grandfather's quote is somewhat didactic. The reprise of the phrase "encrypted compassion" at the end feels a bit heavy-handed, summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image speak entirely for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the setting. However, the reliance on repeating specific descriptors ("dappled," "trembling") makes the authorial hand visible, slightly distancing the reader from the character's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the sentence rhythm is generally good, the prose suffers from significant lexical looping. Distinct phrases like "dappled resolve," "encrypted compassion," and "trembled" are repeated verbatim or with slight variation within a short space, creating a formulaic echo effect that mars the polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of geothermal engineering and bureaucratic intrigue creates a fresh narrative frame. The specific tactical choice of the unsealed letter elevates the story beyond a standard puzzle-solving plot, adding a unique note of political savvy.</comment>
