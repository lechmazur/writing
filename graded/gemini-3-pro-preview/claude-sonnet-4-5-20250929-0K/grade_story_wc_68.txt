<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus’s internal definition as a philosopher is immediately tested by the reality of his "sewer rat" existence. The shift from isolationist to conspirator is earned via his specific worldview ("sedimentary layers"), though the label "rational rebellion" feels slightly more stated than dramatized until the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is excellent, with the handing over of the cog serving as a legible Resonant Reconfiguration that solidifies the alliance. The cost is distinct—he gives up his "most precious possession"—and the logic of the turn follows the established "sedimentary" metaphor perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary pressure; the rising water and "sedimentary layers" constrain choices and charge the final image. The physical reality of the drowned city integrates seamlessly with the thematic argument, elevating the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stakes (erasure of history) are high and clear, and the pressure tightens appropriately with Karin's news. However, the conflict remains largely intellectual and polite; while fitting for the tone, it lacks the visceral friction of a harder-fought negotiation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the theme is coherent, Karin explicitly articulates the story’s thesis in dialogue ("The real battles aren't fought in councils..."), which flattens the subtext. This didactic moment converts what could have been an earned realization into a lecture, triggering a Thematic Echo deduction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a meditative, slightly elevated register that suits Marcus’s philosopher persona without becoming purple. The distance is well-managed, keeping us firmly in his interpretive frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong image systems ("sedimentary layers," "candlelight catch its teeth"). A few phrases lean towards abstraction ("represented everything Marcus believed about truth"), but the rhythm and density are generally high-quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the post-apocalyptic archivist trope with the "sedimentary" metaphor creates a distinct texture. While the "secret society forming in the ruins" beat is familiar, the specific execution via the cog and the strata metaphor feels fresh.</comment>
