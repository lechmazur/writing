<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marianne’s internal landscape of grief and skepticism is rendered with precision, creating a strong emotional anchor. The transition from skeptic to believer is rapid but earned through the visceral evidence of the tooth and the prior trauma of the "straw man." The trait of being "shrewdly innocent" effectively contextualizes her past failure, adding depth to her current resolve. Her final choice to "learn" feels like a natural evolution of her character’s desire to fix what is broken.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and compelling, moving from the disruption of the fake body to the garden encounter without wasted motion. The inciting incident (the body in the millpond) provides excellent immediate pressure that justifies the scene's existence. Closure is distinct and definitive; the decision to "bridge the gap" represents a clear Decisive Change in her worldview and life path. The causal link between the tooth, the daughter's explanation, and the mother's choice is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "impossibly wrong" November garden contrasting sharply with the "clockwork certainty" of the outside world. Sensory details like the "violet-silver" roses and the "root still pink with blood" ground the magical elements in a visceral reality. The contrast between the cold maze and the warm, copper-scented garden effectively mirrors Marianne's internal shift. The environment actively supports the mood of discovery and transition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are intensely personal and clearly established: the possibility of retrieving her lost daughter versus the safety of her skepticism. The escalation provided by the physical evidence of the tooth forces a confrontation with her past denial. While the external pressure (magic breaking down) is delivered through exposition, the emotional pressure on Marianne is immediate and palpable. The cost of the choice—abandoning her "comfortable prison" of certainty—is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "bone setting" as a metaphor for healing trauma and reality is poignant and well-developed. However, the thematic delivery in the dialogue ("mistakes aren't endings—they're raw material") leans toward the didactic, explicating the subtext rather than letting it breathe. The motif of "constellations" ties the ending together nicely, though the explicit connection weakens the resonance slightly by over-explaining it. The emotional core remains strong despite the heavy-handed delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, balancing the analytical tone of a doctor with the repressed emotion of a grieving mother. The POV remains tightly anchored in Marianne’s perspective, filtering the magical elements through her skeptical lens effectively. There are moments where the voice explains her emotional state ("Marianne wanted to yearn") rather than showing it, but the overall tone is coherent and appropriate. The rhythm of the prose supports the pacing well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and competent, with some striking images like the "tooth pulsed... warm as a star." However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She found herself," "Marianne recognized," "Marianne wanted to") creates unnecessary distance in key moments. Some similes, such as "cracked open like an egg," feel slightly standard compared to the vividness of the garden description. Line-level momentum is good, but the filtering dampens the immediacy of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story offers a solid synthesis of changeling folklore with a more clinical, reparative approach ("bone setting" the world). The shift from a rescue mission to an apprenticeship ("Teach me") adds a fresh agency to the mother figure, moving beyond simple reunion tropes. While the "secret garden" and "hedge maze" are familiar elements, the specific application of the medical metaphor to the magical problem elevates the concept. It feels like a mature, well-considered take on the genre.</comment>
