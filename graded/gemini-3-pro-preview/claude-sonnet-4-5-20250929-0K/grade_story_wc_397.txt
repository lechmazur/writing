<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is rendered with vivid sensory detail ("holding water"), establishing a distinct psychological state. However, the pivotal shift from seeking euthanasia to volunteering happens with minimal on-page resistance or doubt, making the transformation feel slightly smooth and therapeutic rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure is sound, and the postponement of the consultation serves as a clear Decisive Change. However, the final transition ("stayed... through summer, then autumn") relies on summary to bypass the immediate aftermath of the decision, distancing the reader from the cost of living on.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting acts as a powerful mirror to the protagonist's internal dissolution; the "drift ice that never quite melted" is a precise objective correlative. The lighthouse clinic anchors the stakes physically, integrating the environment with the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>While the stakes are existential (life vs. death), the external pressure is low; the doctor serves as a gentle mentor rather than a source of friction. The resolution comes through steady accumulation of insight rather than a sharp escalation of cost, reducing narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story builds a coherent meditation on mortality, but the final sentence explicitly summarizes the lesson ("change wasn't death calling, but life insisting"). This explainer ending collapses the story's subtext into a diagnostic moral, triggering the penalty for thematic summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, perfectly suiting the "translucent" reality Vera perceives. Control over psychic distance is tight, filtering all observations through her specific, altered sensorium without slipping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and evocative imagery ("ivory tip worn smooth"). The prose rhythm supports the contemplative pacing without dragging, avoiding scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The speculative element of hearing "endings" adds a fresh layer to the familiar "healing through service" narrative arc. While the execution is elegant, the underlying structure follows a standard therapeutic template without subverting the expected emotional trajectory.</comment>
