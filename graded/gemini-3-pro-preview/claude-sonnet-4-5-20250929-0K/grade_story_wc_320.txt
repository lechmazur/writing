<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clearly stated ("find the beginning in every ending") but functions more as a thematic label than a source of visceral drive or conflict. The internal struggle between protocol and intuition is resolved too easily, with the transition from doubt to epiphany lacking the friction or error that characterizes deep characterization. Her emotional arc feels smoothed over, missing the contradictory impulses of a 9-band character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear Causal path: problem, memory, action, result. While coherent, the "turn" relies on a convenient memory of the mentor rather than active struggle or failure that forces a hard choice. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of resistance or complication makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric details ("iron prayers," "throat of darkness") effectively establish a mood of melancholy wonder. The setting is vivid and integrates well with the protagonist's internal state. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop for the epiphany rather than offering physical constraints that force specific tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; Mira faces no genuine threat of failure or loss, only a sense of professional ennui. The "tuning" moment, intended as the climax, encounters zero resistance—she changes the dial and immediately finds the prize. Without a felt cost or a credible risk of failure, the escalation remains flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing to convey its theme, particularly in the final paragraphs ("silence wasn't absence," "every ending was simply a beginning"). The subtext is suffocated by these explanations. A higher score would require the imagery and action to carry the resonance without the narrator stepping in to summarize the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "fantasy" aspect of the tone, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("mathematical poetry," "shard of hush"). The POV remains securely with Mira. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the tendency to over-explain internal realizations dampens the immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, but suffers from abstract metaphors that blur rather than sharpen imagery ("veins of frozen light," "blueprint of silence"). The phrase "guts of a gutted transmitter" is a distracting repetition. The writing is competent but lacks the dense, concrete precision of the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of listening to dying stars is engaging but treated with familiar genre tropes. The reinterpretation of "Hollywood" as a star is a clever pivot to fit the prompt but is delivered via clunky expository dialogue. The resolution—finding hope in silence—is a safe, standard choice for this genre.</comment>
