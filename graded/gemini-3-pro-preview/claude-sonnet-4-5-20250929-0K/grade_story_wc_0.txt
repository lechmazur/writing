<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary, fusing professional expertise with private grief to drive a unique worldview. The "preprocessing" attribute is dramatized through the specific action of creating an "island of order" amidst chaos. The internal shift from resistance to humility is earned via the tactile work of the scene rather than mere introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the wreckage from a site of loss to a site of "transformation observed patiently." The drive lens (Hybrid: Accumulative/Causal) holds perfectly, with the physical sorting of scales causing the thematic epiphany. Pacing is controlled and the "wreck" vs. "order" constraint shapes the protagonist's tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is outstanding; the "overlapping shingles of chitin" and "waterlogged tomato plants" ground the abstract themes in gritty reality. The microscope acts as a functional micro-setting that constrains attention and enables the epiphany. The interplay between the muddy ruin and the illuminated slide creates excellent atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively internalized; the pressure comes from the need to find meaning in destruction. While external conflict is minimal, the intellectual and emotional escalation—deepening from scavenging to scientific analysis to philosophical reconfiguration—is coherent. The cost is the surrender of her desire for "stripped drama," replaced by a heavier understanding of decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central parallel between neutron stars and butterflies is profound and well-developed through action. However, the final two paragraphs veer into explicit moralizing ("Helena understood... because," "Just like everything..."), articulating the thesis rather than letting the resonant image of the glowing scales stand alone. This over-explanation softens the subtextual power at the finish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and confident, maintaining a precise, analytical filter that matches the protagonist's background. The modulation between scientific observation ("decay curves," "light interference") and emotional resonance is seamless. POV distance is strictly controlled, allowing the reader to inhabit Helena's specific way of seeing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery ("glowed like stars," "tiny mirror"). The connection between the macro (stars) and micro (scales) is handled with linguistic precision. A slight reliance on summary descriptors for emotions in the latter half ("kindled humility") prevents a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes two disparate fields—astrophysics and lepidopterology—into a fresh, organic whole. The execution feels inevitable rather than forced, transforming the familiar "finding beauty in ruin" trope through specific, character-driven details. The intellectual rigor of the comparison elevates the emotional arc.</comment>
