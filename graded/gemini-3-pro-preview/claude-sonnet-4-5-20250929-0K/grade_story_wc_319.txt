<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maris is a compelling protagonist with a well-dramatized duality between feral instinct and scholarly intellect. Her internal conflict drives the narrative, though the "feral" side is filtered through a highly articulate internal monologue rather than raw sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and causally tight, moving from a clear objective to a decisive action with legible consequences. The closure lands effectively as a Return/Earned Stasis, resolving the immediate threat while re-establishing the character's permanent burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with evocative sensory details like "breathing wool" and "sickly phosphorescence." The frozen garden is anchored vividly, making the surreal geography feel tangible and pressuring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined—integrity of self vs. safety of the library. The escalation works well through the "homesickness" complication, though the resolution feels slightly safe; the cost is paid in a return to status quo rather than a new scar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, duty, and identity are coherent and resonate through the imagery. The explicit statement of "making friends with uncertainty" feels slightly imposed as a thesis rather than emerging organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and precise. It leans heavily into the scholarly aspect of the character ("interiorizing exteriors"), which slightly distances the reader from the "feral" physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong rhythm. A few phrases required by the prompt (e.g., "interiorizing exteriors") feel slightly abstract and jargon-heavy compared to the vivid physical descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a librarian guarding via dreams is engaging, and the "dimensional homesickness" adds a fresh, weird-fiction layer to the trope. The execution elevates a standard guardian-vs-thief setup.</comment>
