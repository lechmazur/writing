<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is rich, but her arc feels more like a verbalized explanation than a dramatized struggle; she interprets her father’s history with a certainty that lowers the stakes of the inquiry. Her "featherly determination" is stated rather than shown through difficult choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative structure is coherent, moving from observation to a valid Conceptual Repricing where she chooses to "build thresholds." However, the pivot relies heavily on dialogue exposition rather than active pressure to force the realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" and "chairs that existed in three states simultaneously" are excellent, high-density surreal details that effectively ground the abstract premise. The physical world serves the thematic logic well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely intellectual; the interaction with Thomas is gentle and supportive, lacking the friction or risk required to make the final epiphany feel earned by cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central metaphor of transforming confusion (mazes) into revelation (thresholds) is strong, but the final sentence explicitly defining the distance as "love" triggers a penalty for moralizing, flattening the story's resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent "fractured hush" that suits the surreal, melancholic setting. The tone modulates well between the technical (weather codes) and the lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled with high information density. Images like "oak rings compressed by decades" efficiently bridge the physical and the thematic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of refugees inhabiting the drift after a causality break is imaginative and fresh. The synthesis of pilot codes and corn mazes offers a unique lens on the theme of navigation.</comment>
