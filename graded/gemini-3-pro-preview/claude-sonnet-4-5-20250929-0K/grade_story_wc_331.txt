<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cordelia is a distinct focalizer with a clear objective, but her journey lacks internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her path is linear and unopposed, reducing the character work to enacting a ritual rather than navigating a dilemma with personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear "enactment" structure where a plan succeeds exactly as intended without complication or sacrifice. The closure offers "Symmetric Satisfaction"—a positive outcome with no visible, felt, or conceptual cost to balance the magical gain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific details like "treatises on thermodynamics rendered as sonnets" grounding the concept. The library’s geometry actively shapes the climax and charges the final image, fulfilling the high-band criteria for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; there are no obstacles, antagonists, or internal doubts that force a narrowing of options. The ritual is performed in a vacuum of pressure, resulting in a low-stakes progression that fails to test the protagonist's commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit thesis statements ("Stories weren't abstract") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending reinforces this stated philosophy without adding complex resonance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, scholarly, and slightly lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. It effectively manages the shift from observation to metaphysical realization, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, but relies on filter verbs ("She felt the building breathe") and abstract lists to convey the magic system. These artifacts distance the reader during the climax, telling the experience rather than showing the sensory shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry and literary theory is an engaging premise, but the "magical library" trope is executed safely. The lack of risk or subversion in the narrative arc keeps the story in comfortable, familiar territory.</comment>
