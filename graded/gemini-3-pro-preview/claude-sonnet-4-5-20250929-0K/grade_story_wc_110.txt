<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s internal state is well-rendered, moving from passive observer to active participant. Dmitri is viewed largely through Mira’s projection, but his fear is dramatized effectively via the voiceover. The transition from observer to actor is motivated, though the specific logic of the doodle-decoding relies slightly on a convenient realization rather than deep character pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete with a clear Decisive Change (the relationship shift). However, the central causal mechanic—using a projector lens to overlap doodles and find hidden meanings—strains credibility as a deliberate communication strategy by a "cowardly" character. It operates on poetic logic rather than strict causality, which softens the plot's backbone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustic property of the forecourt creates the inciting incident naturally. The sensory details ("wet stone," "suspended shard") effectively ground the scene and support the "resonant hush" tone required by the prompt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (romantic connection vs. isolation) and pressure is applied via the overheard confession. The escalation is linear and relatively low-risk until the final action. The cost is emotional vulnerability, which is felt, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once the secret is known.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of communication and clarity is consistent. The ending resonates with the concept of "honesty," but the final paragraph ("The quiet night registrar had finally stopped eavesdropping...") leans into moralizing summary rather than letting the image speak for itself, slightly dampening the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering observations clearly through Mira’s perspective. The narrative voice is polished and fits the slightly dreamlike, acoustic atmosphere of the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and atmospherically dense. There are minor filter verbs ("She recognized," "Mira saw") that distance the reader slightly in key moments. The final sentence is a scaffold summary that explains the theme, which detracts from the otherwise strong "show" of the hand-holding beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story integrates the prompt elements into a cohesive, if somewhat standard, romance arc. The use of the acoustic forecourt is a nice touch, though the "puzzle tickets" trope feels a bit familiar. It is a competent execution of the components without radical innovation.</comment>
