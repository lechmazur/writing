<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Maris is a compelling focalizer whose interiority ("hollow knowledge") perfectly motivates the surreal climax. The choice to sacrifice her physical existence for memory is earned by the clearly established emotional stakes of her grandmother's disappearance. The integration of her job (lantern lighting) with the resolution is masterful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and resonant; the final transformation (becoming a memory-crystal) is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost. The narrative arc from the gravity anomaly to the specific cause (whale heart) is tight and logically sound under the story's dream-logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the gravity fluctuations dictate movement and pacing effectively. The "salt crystal growing chambers" provides a vivid, textured backdrop that grounds the metaphysical concepts in physical sensory details ("gasoline-slick," "cold biting").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate from physical danger (gravity) to existential risk (entering the heart). The pressure remains coherent, driving Maris toward a singular, irreversible choice. The cost—erasure from the present world—is palpable and thematically fitting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of conservation of memory/matter is beautifully executed without feeling didactic. The narrative intertwines the physical anomaly (gravity) with the thematic core (weight of memory) seamlessly. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, melancholic, and confident, maintaining a consistent tone that suits the magical realism. Perception is filtered strictly through Maris's obsession and expertise, creating a strong perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density. Minor usage of slightly abstract phrases ("dimensions she couldn't name," "recursive and purposeful") prevents a perfect score, but the sensory imagery ("smell of lamp oil and lavender") is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of tropes; the combination of a beached whale, gravity distortions, and salt-crystal memory storage feels fresh and specific. The transformation of the grandmother's disappearance into a metaphysical mechanic is ingenious.</comment>
