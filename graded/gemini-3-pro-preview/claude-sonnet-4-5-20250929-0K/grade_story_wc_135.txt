<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marina functions effectively as a thematic vessel, but her internal landscape is largely summarized rather than dramatized through pressure. The "reactive vision" trait is explained in exposition rather than shown through a difficult choice, and her interaction with Thomas lacks friction or contradictory impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The structure is coherent and linear, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. However, the narrative path is frictionless; the "staggered intervals" method manages the scene too easily, and the resolution (Thomas accepting the valve) feels inevitable rather than earned against resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor is established with competent sensory details ("rain-darkened wood"), but the occupational title "ocean-spray archivist" conflicts confusingly with the reality of archiving solid objects (toys, buttons). The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stakes are emotional and declared (the weight of 17 years), but the on-page conflict is minimal. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or difficult trade-offs; the reunion and the handover of the object proceed smoothly without testing her resolve or "reactive" ability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of preserving meaning in absence is clear but delivered through explicit statements ("archive was a monument to empty spaces") rather than subtext. The ending articulates the moral ("To hearten those who returned") directly, reducing interpretive resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "aftermath" tone. However, it leans on abstract, writerly phrasing ("navigated absences") that distances the reader from immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with a strong opening. There are minor "purple" tendencies ("gleaming like promises kept") and some hedging ("Hope, perhaps, or something more complicated") that soften the impact of specific images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of archiving for exiles is poignant, but the execution follows a standard "healing reunion" template. The specific "ocean-spray" element feels like an unintegrated prompt artifact rather than a fresh organic invention.</comment>
