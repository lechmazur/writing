<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Margot's interiority is rich, but Sena's dialogue ("You've been looking for the pattern") feels expository, diagnosing the protagonist's motivation externally rather than allowing it to remain subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands, but a continuity contradiction undermines the setup: the opening states the letter "wasn't hers," while the climax reveals she wrote it "to herself," confusing the prop's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the temple and the nest installation are not mere backdrops but active constraints that frame the narrative and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Internal stakes are legible, but external pressure is gentle; the resolution arrives through an invitation and a guided realization rather than a high-pressure choice with sharper resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of connection through shared brokenness is handled with nuance, effectively anchoring the "sacred geometry" concept in the specific imagery of the nest and threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, mirroring the protagonist's profession as a ghostwriter, though the shift from observer to participant is slightly smoothed by the dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, evocative, and polished ("cupped palm holding silence"), with excellent rhythm and sensory precision; no scaffold artifacts or line-level drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of the ghostwriter trope with the art installation setting, though the structural slip regarding the letter's ownership dampens the ingenuity of the reveal.</comment>
