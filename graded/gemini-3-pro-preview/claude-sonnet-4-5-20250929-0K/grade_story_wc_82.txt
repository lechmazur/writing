<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mei is a compelling focalizer whose grief is active rather than passive; her "cunning" nature (bribing priests, reinventing the craft) adds distinct layers to the mourning mother archetype. The physical toll of the work (trembling hands) and the emotional contradictions (hope vs. bearable torment) are embodied well. The internal state drives the ritualistic action without lapsing into melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a strong Accumulative lens, using the process of the craft to structure the emotional arc. The backstory of the bribe is integrated smoothly without stalling momentum. Closure is an excellent example of Earned Stasis: the release of the crane doesn't magically fix the problem, but crystallizes Mei's resolve to continue the labor ("Eight hundred and fifty-two cranes remained"), landing with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vesper Isle is rendered with vivid, specific imagery that supports the story's logic; the "roots growing downward into clouds" and the "glass basilica" create a memorable, impossible geography. The setting actively constrains the action, forcing the release at the island's edge. The sensory detail of the tea garden mirrors the protagonist's internal state—beautiful but unbearable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Lin's restoration) is clear, and the countdown of the cranes provides a tangible measure of the protagonist's burden. The pressure is coherent and accumulative, tightening as Mei confronts the vastness of the task against the fragility of the memory. The cost is felt in the sacrifice of her possessions and the grueling physical repetition of the folds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into tangible labor is deftly handled, avoiding platitudes in favor of a complex mechanical metaphor. The paradox of "descending while ascending" resonates deeply with the nature of loss and hope. The final mantra ("Transform, polish, fold, release") successfully anchors the abstract theme in concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent atmospheric control that blends the lyrical with the technical. The integration of science-fantasy diction ("quantum space," "stratosphere") within a tea-garden setting creates a distinct, intelligent texture. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mei's perception throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like "stars emerged like pin-holes in black paper." The phrase "luminous torment" appears twice; while effective as a thematic bracket, its repetition in a short space risks feeling slightly heavy-handed. Otherwise, the line-level craft is polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-recording, origami, and a gravity-defying island creates a fresh, specific magic system. While "reclaiming a lost part of a child" is a classic trope, the "descending/ascending" physics and the bureaucratic element of the Dream Archive give it a unique, thoroughly realized identity.</comment>
