<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict—technical mastery versus spiritual blindness—is dramatized well through the tactile method. The choice to abandon the attempt at "recognition" in favor of "honesty" (the reflected stars) provides a solid character arc, though the initial reaction ("laughed") feels slightly staged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clean situational arc with a clear deadline (demolition) forcing a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is effective: she accepts the limitation and reconfigures the portrait's meaning, paying the cost of never truly knowing the subject.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the closure; the "open crown" of the doomed library directly inspires the final addition to the painting. The sensory details of the hollowed oak and the pre-dawn light ground the abstract internal conflict effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pressure is coherent, driven by the demolition trucks and the impossible task. The escalation moves from physical attempts (touching the coin) to philosophical resignation, which works well, though the external threat remains largely atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "limits vs. gifts" is resonant, supported by the empty book safe and the ghost-coin. However, the final sentence explicitly states the moral ("Some limits... define us"), which deflates the tension of the final image and triggers the thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The POV is consistent and controlled, filtering the world effectively through the artist's tactile focus. The narrative voice matches the melancholic, precise tone of the character without slipping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the flow is generally good, the root word "fractal" is overused (four times: "fractally precise detail," "measurements," "documentation," "stars fractaling"), becoming a distracted text artifact. This repetition dulls the impact of the description significantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of a face-blind artist using tactile methods in a fantasy setting is a fresh synthesis. The execution transforms the "demolished library" trope into a specific, character-driven moment.</comment>
