<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s "borrowed personality" trait is integrated well into the mechanics of the scene, driving the shift to the mathematician persona. However, the cost of her "dissolved self" feels more like backstory than an acute price paid in the present action; the emotional stakes are stated ("hearts break and mend") rather than viscerally felt through a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the messenger's arrival to the printing of the emotional map. The closure—an Earned Stasis where she continues working despite the dying stars—lands effectively. The link between "understanding the math" and "saving the stars" remains slightly tenuous, relying on soft magic logic rather than causal rigor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric grounding. The topaz workshop, bioluminescent veins, and the oppression of the vanishing stars create a vivid, unique setting that mirrors the internal melancholy. The environment actively pulses with the character’s mood, integrating setting into the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The external pressure (dying universe) provides a ticking clock, but the conflict remains largely internal and intellectual (solving a puzzle). The protagonist doesn't face significant opposition or a moment of potential failure that forces a trade-off; she simply applies her skills and succeeds at the task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of emotional unity is clear, but the execution relies on explicit "thematic echo" lines ("Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance"). This reduces subtext to a formula, explaining the insight to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate organically through the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable-like sci-fi tone perfectly. The shift in internal rhythm when she adopts the mathematician’s persona is a subtle, effective touch that demonstrates control over psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from simile density ("like a frozen lake," "sharp as broken glass," "viscous as honey," "like a dying flower"). While individual images are strong, the accumulation creates a slightly overwrought texture that occasionally slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics, empathy work, and a dying universe is fresh and engaging. While the "entropy/dying stars" trope is common, framing the solution as a typographical/emotional equation offers a distinct and creative angle.</comment>
