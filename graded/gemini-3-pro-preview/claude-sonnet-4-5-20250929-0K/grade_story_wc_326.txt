<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s internal state is well-rendered through the heartbeat motif, though the repetition of "one-two-three" borders on mechanical. The transition from guilt to peace is earned emotionally, though the absolution comes from an external source (Chen's note) rather than internal growth, slightly softening the character's agency in the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly, but the central mechanism—using spilled ink patterns to defragment digital server drives—strains plausibility in a hard sci-fi setting. While it satisfies the prompt, the causal link between analog chaos and specific digital data reconstruction reads as techno-magic, weakening the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the "opal observatory" and "cathedral silence" effectively ground the isolation. The cold is palpable and acts as a mild constraint on the protagonist, enhancing the mood of the vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (guilt vs. truth), but the escalation is primarily procedural (trying methods) rather than deepening personal cost. The resolution dissolves the conflict by revealing there was no failure to begin with, which lowers the retrospective stakes of the protagonist's struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding "wisdom from failure" is undercut by the twist that Mira’s math was actually perfect; she finds exoneration, not wisdom in error. The "static" metaphor works well, but the final message leans into explicit moralizing ("Some things don't need repair... They need reinterpretation").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, matching the snowy isolation. The shift to the "digital ghost" concept is handled with good tonal control, though the pacing feels slightly rushed during the climactic data recovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("pearl half-buried," "fractaling outward"). Minor tendency toward melodrama in moments ("tears freezing on her cheeks") and some standard phrasing ("deafening noise of failure") prevents higher banding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "it wasn't a mistake, it was a sacrifice" reveal is a familiar trope that reduces the novelty of the emotional arc. While the ink-as-algorithm concept is inventive, its implementation feels forced, lacking the setup required to make it feel like a genuine scientific insight rather than a plot device.</comment>
