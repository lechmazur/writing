<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina serves primarily as a witness to the statue's agency, reacting to revelations rather than driving the scene until the final beat. While her internal shift from "comfortable lie" to complex truth is clear, the transition feels smooth and inevitable rather than fraught with the "contradictory impulses" required for higher bands. The emotional cost of losing her historical certainty is stated ("reeling") more than dramatized through resistance or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The scene is tightly constructed with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the statue’s release marks a definitive change. The integration of backstory via telepathy maintains the present-moment anchor without dissolving the underwater tension. The pacing effectively matches the "ticking" oxygen gauge, creating a cohesive narrative unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is tactile, vivid, and causally integrated; the "marble lungs pulling brine" and "scales dressed in anemones" ground the fantasy in visceral reality. The environment acts as evidence, not just backdrop, with the foxglove ampoule serving as a critical micro-setting element that anchors the revelation. This category is the story's strongest asset.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The historical stakes escalate beautifully from accident to calculated sacrifice, deepening the narrative pressure. However, the immediate physical threat (the oxygen gauge) runs parallel to the choice rather than forcing a difficult trade-off; she decides to tell the truth and simply ascends, leaving the potential cost of that decision conceptual rather than felt in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story builds a compelling thematic argument about complicity but undermines it in the final paragraph with explicit moralizing. The dialogue "history lives in shades of gray" triggers a significant "Thematic Echo" penalty (-0.8 range) for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language at the climax, flattening the resonance into a lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent, successfully blending Marina’s perspective with the statue's intrusive thoughts. The distinction between the statue’s "incisive kindness" and Marina’s historian voice is handled well, avoiding confusion even during the telepathic exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("mortar," "colonize"). A minor deduction applies for the visible insertion of prompt phrases like "cascading revelations" and "welcome nuance" as summary labels, which occasionally disrupt the otherwise immersive prose texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inversion of the sunken city trope—poisoning the foundation to save the workers—is a fresh, specific synthesis that feels earned. The central image of a breathing statue acting as a witness to its own creator’s crime offers a memorable and original angle on the "living construct" archetype.</comment>
