<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara acts as a benevolent plot device rather than a character under pressure; she experiences no internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or personal cost for her intervention. Her motivation is stated in summary ("I’ve seen what happens") rather than dramatized through a struggle that tests her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The story relies on a summary montage ("At dawn," "After two weeks," "The recovery came slowly") to bypass the central conflict, resulting in a linear progression without causal friction. Closure is achieved through a thematic lecture rather than a decisive change or felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, with "serpentine shadows" and the "butterfly garden watering bell" effectively grounding the atmosphere. The environment is integrated into the narrative, though the "floating arches" feel slightly ornamental rather than constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("Separately, we're dying") but resolved via narration; the colony's fracturing and subsequent reunification happen in summary without on-page confrontation or trade-offs. The ease of the solution undercuts the stated severity of the crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story ends with a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly states the moral ("respite isn't a place") in dialogue. This didactic approach flattens the subtext and resolves the theme through assertion rather than resonant action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and fitting for a soft sci-fi fable, though the POV drifts into omniscience to describe collective settler feelings ("something in the messages felt strangely trustworthy"). The shift to Kessa's perspective at the end further distances the reader from Mara’s interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with some evocative phrasing ("brambled hope"), but the reliance on summary telling ("The recovery came slowly") reduces information density and immediacy. The narrative distance prevents the prose from doing heavy lifting during key emotional turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "benevolent ghost aiding a colony" is a gentle inversion of tropes, but the execution remains safe and predictable. The story takes few risks, resolving its central problem with a convenient method that meets little resistance.</comment>
