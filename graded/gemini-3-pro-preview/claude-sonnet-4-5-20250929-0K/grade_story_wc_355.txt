<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marlow's internal conflict—the desire to know versus the need to respect silence—is dramatized well. Her backstory feels slightly list-like ("radio archaeologists") to fit the prompt, but her final renunciation is a strong, character-driven choice that earns the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent fabulist logic where emotional frequencies affect physical locks. The closure (Renunciation) is distinct and meaningful; she succeeds in opening the lock but chooses not to violate the privacy, satisfying the plot while subverting the goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid, particularly the synesthetic descriptions of sound ("amber hum," "silver scratch"). The setting of the ruined workshop under the stars effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state—broken but open.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as relational recovery. The escalation mechanism (tuning through specific memories) builds pressure effectively, and the climax forces a trade-off between satisfying curiosity and honoring the sister's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme is central, but the ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the sister's note explicitly articulates the thesis ("You just didn't know my frequency"). This didactic confirmation reduces the interpretive resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately contemplative for the subject. It handles the magical realism elements with confidence, though the tone wavers slightly when inserting specific prompt phrases.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("locks... frozen conversations"). However, the forced insertion of prompt-mandated phrases like "intuitively descriptive" creates minor rhythmic stumbles and syntactic awkwardness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of using radio frequencies to unlock a diary is imaginative and fresh. While the emotional beats follow a somewhat traditional path to forgiveness, the specific mechanism and "radio archaeologist" framing add distinct ingenuity.</comment>
