<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc is largely summarized rather than dramatized. The pivotal shift ("The work changed her") is stated diagnostically rather than shown through a specific high-pressure choice or realization in scene. The emotional stakes ("hollow weight") feel generic and resolved too smoothly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on montage, summarizing weeks of wandering and excavation instead of sustaining tension in a contained scene. While the closure (deciding to stay) is legible, the lack of immediate scene pressure makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting concept—an orchard drawing life from catacombs—is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated. Details like roots coiling around skulls "like careful fingers" effectively ground the surreal premise in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; external obstacles are cleared via summary ("spent weeks clearing"), and the villagers offer help without friction. The lack of an antagonist, time pressure, or a difficult trade-off results in a low-stakes progression where success feels guaranteed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme is stated explicitly via the sundial inscription ("Time breaks all journeys...") and the narrator's final summary, leaving little room for subtext. This overt moralizing flattens the resonance, reducing the complex premise to a tidy lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive, reverent tone suitable for a fable. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard literary phrasing that keeps the reader at a slight remove.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and functional but leans on clichés ("drifting down like snow," "hollow weight") that dull the imagery. While technically clean, the line-level craft lacks the freshness and density required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central image of the bone-fed orchard is imaginative and striking. However, the plot trajectory—a returnee healing through restoration—is conventional and executes without significant narrative risk or twist.</comment>
