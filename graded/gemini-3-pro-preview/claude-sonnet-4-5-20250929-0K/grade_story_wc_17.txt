<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is clearly defined by her role and legacy, but her internal arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from the "burden pressing harder" to the "burden feeling lighter" occurs instantly upon discovery, functioning as an intellectual realization rather than an earned emotional shift with visible cost. The attribute "sensitively perceptive" is told as an expository label rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The structure is legible and the "dreaming forward" concept lands a coherent Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the plot relies heavily on the "magic bullet" coincidence of finding the exact film negative of herself to force the resolution, which shortcuts the need for protagonist agency in solving the mystery. The causal link depends more on the environment's magic than the character's choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "acoustic signatures" and "sodden ash" grounding the speculative elements. The environment actively mirrors the theme, particularly the ivy acting as a nervous system. The setting feels lived-in and distinct, though it stops short of constraining the character's tactical options in a high-stakes way.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely conceptual; while the mystery is compelling, there is no active opposition or time pressure forcing difficult decisions. The resolution comes as a gift—a discovery that validates her grandfather—rather than a victory won through sacrifice. Consequently, the "felt cost" required for higher bands is absent; she gains enlightenment without paying a price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of architecture as a living memory system is inventive and well-integrated into the plot. However, the ending drifts into explicit moralizing ("she wasn't trying to prove... she was learning to dream with them"), explaining the thesis to the reader rather than allowing the resonance of the final image to carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "drowning city" vibe. However, immersion is periodically broken by expository filtering and "helpful narrator" syndrome, particularly the clunky characterization of Maya's "sensitively perceptive nature," which summarizes her traits instead of trusting the reader to infer them from her actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is functional with some strong images ("ghost-pressure of thousands of hands"), but suffers from filter verbs ("She realized," "She thought of") that distance the reader. Occasional clichés ("roots that cracked stone like paper") and expository shorthand reduce the information density and immediacy expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core concept of a "corridor echo cartographer" mapping the dreams of buildings is genuinely fresh and engaging. While the execution leans on the familiar trope of a protagonist finding their own image in the past/future, the acoustic twist on the "stone tape" theory elevates the premise above standard speculative fare.</comment>
