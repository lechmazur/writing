<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clearly rooted in trauma, and her interiority is dense and specific. However, the secondary character (Dr. Vahedi) functions purely as a sounding board to explicate themes, lacking genuine friction or agency that would test the protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The framing device of the cooling circuit breakers creates a neat structural loop, but the narrative arc is static; Mira seeks validation and finds it without significant obstacle or reversal. The causal link between atmospheric physics and human grief relies on metaphorical fiat rather than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stratospheric setting is vivid and integral, effectively mirroring the protagonist's frozen isolation. Sensory details like the "frost-rimed window" and the "auroras writhe" ground the abstract scientific premise in a tangible, claustrophobic reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no external pressure forcing a difficult choice. The discovery of the anomaly feels inevitable and convenient, lacking the escalation or cost required to give the "hunt" narrative weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through on-the-nose dialogue ("You're treating reality itself like a geode") rather than subtext. This explicit articulation of the thesis—a "Thematic Echo"—reduces the ending's resonance by explaining the metaphor to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Narrative voice is distinct and lyrically controlled, fitting the mournful tone. However, dialogue often slips into unnatural exposition to accommodate prompt phrases ("Unfiltered awakening," she replied), breaking the scene's verisimilitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, successfully balancing scientific terminology with poetic imagery. However, the text relies on labeling emotions ("bleak exhilaration") rather than evoking them, and some phrasing leans toward the overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Synthesizing perturbation theory with the metaphysics of grief offers a fresh, creative angle on the "trauma survivor" trope. The central metaphor of the geode is clever, though its impact is slightly dulled by the heavy-handed explanation.</comment>
