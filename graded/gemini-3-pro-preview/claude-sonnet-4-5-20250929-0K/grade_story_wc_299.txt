<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus creates a compelling synthesis of roadie grit and antique expertise, grounding the conflict in a specific, lived history. However, the pivotal moment relies on diagnostic self-awareness in dialogue ("I brought facts to something that needs feeling") that reads more like a thematic summary than authentic character speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and efficient, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive internal shift at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively, earning the protagonist's new stance through the pressure of the scene rather than external coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "drafty quarry office" and "aluminum box" provide a stark, sensory-rich backdrop that mirrors the protagonist’s crumbling reputation. Specific details like the "rust holes" (despite a slight semantic slip regarding "puncture") and the limestone dust firmly anchor the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Internal stakes are high and clearly defined; the pressure from the recent public failure gives weight to the appraisal decision. While the external pressure from the attorney is mild, the internal escalation—from retreating into facts to risking instinct—is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of authenticity is well-integrated into the premise, but the story suffers from a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly articulates the subtext in dialogue. This over-explanation flattens the resonance of the final image, stating what should have been left to the reader's intuition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical vocabulary from two disparate fields effectively. The score is limited only by the dialogue in the middle section, which drifts into expository functionality rather than maintaining the naturalism established in the narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong imagery ("holy silence," "prayer flag") and no significant scaffolding artifacts. The metaphor of reputation crumbling like "sedimentary rock" is slightly overwritten, but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a roadie-turned-appraiser offers a genuinely fresh lens on the themes of value and authenticity. While the "trust your gut" resolution is a familiar trope, the unique specificities of the character's background elevate the execution above the standard.</comment>
