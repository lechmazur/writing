<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara functions as a competent focalizer with a clear motivation, but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance. The attribute "richly perceptive" is applied as a label rather than demonstrated through unique, difficult observations that drive choices. The emotional arc is linear, moving from grief to resolution without a moment of significant doubt or agonizing trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the central revelation is delivered passively via the seashell's monologue rather than earned through active deduction or struggle. The concept of "progressive disclosure" feels inserted as a pacing mechanism rather than an organic plot driver. Closure is achieved, but the "explain-everything" nature of the artifact deflates the mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus" is evoked with strong atmospheric detail and sensory specificity ("shadows pooled like spilled ink"). The setting actively supports the acoustic logic of the story. The physical environment feels tangible, though the petroglyphs appear somewhat conveniently to support the exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conflict is largely internal and lacks external pressure; the canyon does not resist Mara, and the shell yields its secrets readily. The stakes are felt (legacy/memory), but the escalation is low-resistance—she simply descends deeper and listens. The final cost—a hoarse voice—is relatively minor compared to the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism. The sister's recorded voice explicitly articulates the story's moral thesis ("Teach them that to be remembered..."), stripping the narrative of subtext. This sermonizing approach replaces dramatic resonance with instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally veers into purple prose ("curved like ancient spines"). The integration of technical prompt terms ("progressive disclosure," "webs of intrigue") creates jarring register clashes with the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but the prose suffers from "telling" over "showing," particularly with the "richly perceptive" label. The insertion of technical phrases required by the prompt disrupts the lyrical texture, reading as artificial scaffold rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core metaphor of echoes representing memory is a familiar trope, executed here with competence but little subversive flair. The resolution—singing to the rocks to heal the silence—feels standard for this sub-genre. The specific "webs of intrigue" concept is diluted to a background detail.</comment>
