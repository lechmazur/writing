<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira is a consistent focalizer with clear motivation, but she lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. Her journey is linear—confirming what she already knows rather than struggling through a difficult choice or cost. The emotional landscape is stable rather than dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well for this length, building from the dead rosebush to the neighborhood mirrors to the final integration of the gauge tooth. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible and valid, connecting the two strands of her heritage, though the stakes of the turn are modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The verticality of the fire escapes and the specific constraint of darkness forcing the mirror mechanic are excellent. The setting actively shapes the protagonist's tactics (using mirrors to catch harbor light), satisfying the "setting constrains choice" requirement for high marks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Conflict is largely environmental and low-pressure; the "suspicion" of the neighborhood is told rather than dramatized in the scene. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening moment where options narrow; instead, it follows a gentle progression of tasks without urgent opposition or high cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("Different methods, same purpose: finding the right combination...") rather than trusting the image to resonate. This explanation of the metaphor in the final paragraph reduces subtextual power and triggers the thematic statement penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the reflective tone. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally dips into slightly precious phrasing that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but suffers from adjectival clustering and label-speak (e.g., "wistfully pragmatic efficiency"). The repetition of "quivering hush" feels like a forced prompt insertion rather than organic description, and some imagery leans toward the sentimental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing and fire-escape gardening via mirrors is a fresh, specific concept. While the emotional arc is somewhat safe, the central mechanical metaphor offers a distinct angle on the theme of urban renewal.</comment>
