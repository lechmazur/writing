<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The thylacine memories are vivid and grounded ("concrete confines," "hollow ache"), offering a strong anchor. However, the protagonist's present-day interiority relies on abstract summaries ("translate isolation into independence") rather than embodied struggle, and her acceptance of the resolution feels unearned by on-page agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a deus ex machina (the book explicitly delivering the answer) to resolve the central conflict, nullifying causal pressure. While the Conceptual Repricing at the end is legible, it lacks a visible or felt cost, offering expansion without sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is highly distinct and tactile, with "atomically reflective walls" and the "tidal" nature of the books actively shaping the imagery. The physical environment (the sundial casting no shadow above the clouds) integrates tightly with the thematic realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and clearly declared, but the story lacks escalation; there is no "tightening" or narrowing of options on the page. The resolution arrives via an external object (the book) rather than a difficult choice or trade-off made by the protagonist under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly through the text of the book ("You are not broken. You are a bridge"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. This overt moralizing in the climax flattens the resonance, leaving little work for the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the surreal atmosphere, maintaining a steady meditative rhythm. It occasionally drifts into essayistic abstraction ("liminal space between presence and absence"), but the tone remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong sensory details ("verdigris-streaked," "white ocean") and good rhythm. Minor artifacting occurs in the final paragraph with repetitive abstract phrasing ("translating the untranslatable"), but line-level craft is generally strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of thylacine reincarnation with a floating, tidal library is a genuinely fresh and creative premise. While the plot arc (epiphany via book) is standard, the conceptual framework and specific imagery elevate the piece significantly.</comment>
