<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marta’s dual identity as a blithe gardener and chess player provides a solid foundation, though the "blithe" trait is stated more than shown in the scene's focused action. The shift from her defeat to the investigation feels consistent with her character, but the emotional connection between the chess loss and the sudden archival insight relies heavily on a convenient thematic bridge rather than deep psychological causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing the grandmother's legacy from simple gardening to an act of historical preservation. However, the pivotal epiphany ("something clicked") shortcuts the causal logic; the leap from realizing "intention" to reading coordinates is thematic rather than strictly logical, slightly weakening the satisfaction of the solve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo serves as a distinct, grounding anchor, described with sensory specificity that effectively establishes the "velveteen" atmosphere. The juxtaposition of the industrial silo with the delicate tapestry creates a memorable visual texture that supports the story's mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While there is internal intellectual pressure to solve the puzzle, the scene lacks immediate external stakes or urgency; Marta has ample time and safety to work. The chess clock metaphor frames the tension nicely, but the actual investigation proceeds without significant obstacles or active resistance, limiting the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The thematic braid tying chess strategy ("the shape of intentions") to the correction of historical records is the story's strongest asset. The ending successfully elevates the grandmother's work from decorative to subversive, offering a satisfying resonance that justifies the dual metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a close third-person distance that tracks Marta's mental state. At times, the tone veers into overwrought imagery (e.g., the silo as a "finger pressed to cosmic lips"), but it generally suits the reflective, nocturnal setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose flows with a good rhythm and manages information density well, avoiding unnecessary scaffolding. However, the climax relies on the cliché "something clicked," and occasional mixed metaphors distract from otherwise competent line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Synthesizing chess strategy with a cemetery archive mystery offers a fresh, specific take on the "hidden code" trope. While the "secret legacy" plot beat is familiar, the specific implementation through embroidery and coordinates feels distinct and creative.</comment>
