<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, but the introspection often feels intellectualized rather than embodied (e.g., the therapist's label "vigil in pause"). The "naked machinery of power" moment leans into abstraction, distancing the reader from the visceral cost of her trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative drive works well, anchored by the rhythmic constraint of the darkroom timer. The closure lands as a solid Earned Stasis, with the bus timetable plan providing just enough forward causality to validate her persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory provides a distinct, isolating stage that suits the premise. However, the descriptions occasionally rely on standard literary tropes ("city sprawled like a broken promise") rather than fresh sensory details that would sharpen the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (erasure vs. testimony), and the timer creates effective micro-pressure within the scene. The conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, which fits the scope, though it lacks a sharp, immediate external test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily over-articulated by the narrator ("That was how resistance survived..."). The text explicitly decodes its own symbols (storm as paradox, words as landmarks), leaving little room for genuine subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffers from a poetic affectation that occasionally breaks immersion. Phrases like "storm-kissed wonder" feel tonally jarring against the disciplined, gritty reality of the darkroom timer and the censorship.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While rhythmically competent, the prose is weighed down by a high density of purple metaphors ("lightning like a prayer," "electrical veins," "bureaucratic ink"). This persistent overwriting obscures the scene's immediate reality in favor of performance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the observatory setting with the mechanical darkroom timer offers a fresh specific container for the familiar "writer as resistance" trope. The procedural element of the timer elevates an otherwise standard setup.</comment>
