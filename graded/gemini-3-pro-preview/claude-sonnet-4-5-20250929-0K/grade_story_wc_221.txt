<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya is a distinct focalizer with clear internal logic, but she remains largely static. The "blessed pariah" identity serves as a label for immunity rather than a source of active struggle or choice in the scene. Her primary action is observation, resulting in a portrait of a state of being rather than a character tested by pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on reflection and summary (approx. 60% of text) to explain the premise, leaving the present-time scene thin. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, the momentum drags significantly due to the backstory load, which explains the transformation rather than dramatizing it in the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery of "temporal strata" and "warped titanium." The sensory details of the supernova and the "probabilistic ghost" of Andromeda effectively ground the abstract premise in concrete visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal and strictly internal; there is no external pressure, time clock, or opposing force to drive escalation. The stakes are philosophical—finding meaning in isolation—which results in a meditative vignette that lacks the tension or deepening required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is consistently developed but heavily explicit. The narrator explains the symbolism directly ("perfect metaphor for her existence") and the final sentence delivers a sermonizing moral that summarizes the thesis ("True north was wherever you stood...") rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative tone. The psychic distance is controlled, keeping the reader firmly in Maya's perspective, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly elevated abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though it occasionally leans on filter verbs ("Maya understood," "She saw") and adjectival phrasing. The imagery is dense, but the reliance on explanation over action prevents the line-level craft from reaching the next tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of an artist mapping temporal strata is a fresh take on the "last survivor" trope. However, the execution follows a safe, standard "observation leading to epiphany" structure without significant narrative risk or formal ingenuity.</comment>
