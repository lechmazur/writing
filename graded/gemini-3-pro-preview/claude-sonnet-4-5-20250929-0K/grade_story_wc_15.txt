<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a devoted archetype rather than a conflicted individual; she lacks internal contradiction or flaws that make choices difficult. The "sleeping intelligence" mechanic removes conscious agency from the central task, as her body solves the maze while her mind is absent, reducing the friction of the struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Each subsequent night," "By the third week") rather than dramatized scenes, which smooths over the causal friction of the task. Closure lands a clear Conceptual Repricing (ruin to reverence), but the accumulation feels inevitable rather than earned through overcoming specific on-page obstacles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details of vermillion walls and indigo thread anchoring the fable. The interplay of light (dawn/sunset) and the physical constraints of the labyrinth are effectively woven into the weaver's methodology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and pressure is low; the weaver faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure. The arrival of travelers validates her efforts immediately rather than complicating them, resulting in a linear progression of success without a "pinch point" or difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of tending ruin into sacred space is coherent and resonant, anchored by the central metaphor of sewing. While the thematic insights are sometimes delivered via narrator assertion ("retracing one's steps wasn't defeat but wisdom") rather than subtext, the final image successfully reweights the labyrinth's meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone that suits the fable-like structure. Control over narrative distance is steady, effectively managing the passage of time and the meditative quality of the weaver's work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density in descriptions ("silk threads that caught the dawn light like veins of precious metal"). A few phrases veer into abstraction ("grammar of possibility"), but the line-level craft generally supports the ethereal tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core concept—repairing a stone labyrinth with thread via sleepwalking—is imaginative and distinct. The execution is safer than the premise, adhering to a gentle healing arc without subverting expectations, but the central image is memorable.</comment>
