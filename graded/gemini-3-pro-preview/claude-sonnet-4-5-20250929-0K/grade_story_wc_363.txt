<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mariko functions effectively as a vessel for the ritual, but her internal landscape is relatively static; she accepts the "latent sacrifice" without a dramatized moment of hesitation or struggle. The forced descriptor "stoically sparkling dedication" severely undermines character credibility, reading as an artificial prompt insertion rather than an organic trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and leads to a definitive Decisive Change at closure, satisfying the causal drive lens. However, the plot relies heavily on grandmother’s expository backstory to establish the rules, rather than Mariko actively discovering the mechanics in the present moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The use of jigsaw puzzle edges to frame a magical absence is a distinct, high-specificity detail that effectively grounds the ethereal magic in the physical world. The atmosphere is consistent, though reliance on "mist" and "bamboo" leans toward standard genre tropes until the puzzle pieces appear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stakes are high (saving a brother vs. self-exile), and the cost is clearly paid on the page. However, the escalation lacks friction; because Mariko’s commitment is absolute from the start, the climax feels like the execution of a procedure rather than a high-pressure choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of sibling sacrifice is coherent and central, but the execution tilts toward sentimentality ("remembered songs and unbroken bonds") at the end. The "raveling silence" serves as an effective, if slightly repetitive, thematic metaphor for loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice aims for a lyrical, fable-like tone but is tripped up by jarring prompt phrases like "stoically sparkling" that clash with the established rhythm. The POV is stable, but the register drifts into purple prose ("reality wore gossamer") that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is competent but marred by significant artifacts; "stoically sparkling" is an adverb-adjective stack that degrades the prose quality. The phrase "raveling silence" is repeated three times in a short space, creating a loop rather than a resonant refrain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central conceit of weaving a portal through ordinary jigsaw puzzle edges is a genuinely imaginative synthesis that freshens the standard "rescue from the void" narrative. The execution is standard, but the core mechanic offers a spark of ingenuity.</comment>
