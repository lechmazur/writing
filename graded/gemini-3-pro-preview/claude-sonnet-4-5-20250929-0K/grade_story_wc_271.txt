<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character interiority is established through the specific "pearl" coping mechanism, but the reliance on diagnostic summary ("Dr. Reeves... explained somatic markers") creates a clinical distance. The protagonist feels static; her traits are often stated ("quietly talented") rather than pressure-tested in the brief scene with the couple.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The piece functions more as a vignette than a narrative with a causal arc; the transition from heavy backstory exposition to the couple's arrival is abrupt. While closure acts as Earned Stasis, the lack of a decisive present-action struggle weakens the structural drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the thriving arboretum against the obsolete lighthouse effectively mirrors the protagonist's resilience. However, some descriptions lean into cliché ("salt-kissed air") rather than fresh, sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Present-tense stakes are low; the primary conflict is internal and retrospective, managed through established habit rather than escalated by the couple's visit. The scene serves as a mirror for reflection rather than a pressure cooker for choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief is coherent but is undercut by the final paragraph, which explicitly defines the metaphor ("The pearl of stillness was this..."). This summary statement replaces earned resonance with didactic telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the reflective mode. It struggles slightly with "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the psychology behind the protagonist's actions instead of trusting the dramatization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose has momentum but is marred by "literary" clichés ("wearing hope like jewelry," "ocean sang its endless song," "salt-kissed"). These artifacts flatten the texture and reduce the impact of the otherwise competent imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise of a gardener healing from trauma through nature is a familiar trope. While executed competently, the story relies on standard emotional beats and metaphors (pearls, blooms) without a distinct, subversive angle.</comment>
