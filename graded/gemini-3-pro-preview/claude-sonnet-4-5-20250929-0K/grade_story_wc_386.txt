<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya is a competent, distinct protagonist with a clear worldview ("desperate arithmetic"), but the scene lacks significant internal conflict or a high-stakes choice beyond the successful execution of the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Causal drive with clear orientation and definitive closure (the decision to go to Halifax). The "melted" glass physics momentarily disrupts verisimilitude in a technical diving context, but the arc is solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric specificity ("glacier's heart," "bones of forgotten ships"); the unique shrine setting grounds the supernatural elements vividly and constrains the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation is linear and cooperative; the protagonist faces little opposition from the ghost or environment, resulting in a low-friction resolution where the "ache" is stated rather than felt as resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of enduring love is resonant, but the ending leans on a summarizing moral ("knowledge that some things survive even drowning") rather than trusting the final image to carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical voice suited to the atmospheric ghost story, though it occasionally drifts into purple description ("voice... settling into Maya's mind like snow").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Polished prose with strong rhythm, marred by physical implausibility (glass warping/melting in a cold wreck) and occasional overwrought metaphors ("strings of pearls").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The specific synthesis of glacier-shrine setting and wreck-diving medium is fresh and imaginative, effectively elevating the standard "unfinished business" trope.</comment>
