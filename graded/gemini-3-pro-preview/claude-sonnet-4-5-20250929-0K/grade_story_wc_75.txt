<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste is a distinct, proactive protagonist whose backstory on displacement solidly motivates her agency. While she drives the plot, the lack of significant internal conflict or personal sacrifice limits the emotional depth of her victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The transition from the inciting discovery (lens fractures) to the community resolution is efficient and fits the short form. However, the resolution relies on a rapid pivot where the physical challenge (melting a monumental waterfall) yields somewhat easily to the thematic solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and integral, creating a claustrophobic yet beautiful atmosphere that pressures the characters. Specific details like the "rosewater dread" and the "emerald-tinted" light ground the fable-like premise in sensory reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established via dwindling supplies and the trapped city. The escalation works, though the resolution feels slightly low-cost physically; the opposition of the ice is overcome more by a shift in perspective than by a grueling trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of cultural continuity through displacement is organically integrated into the plot mechanics (bread, tools). The ending offers a resonant answer to the premise without becoming overly moralistic or abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone that fits the protagonist's background. Interiority and description blend seamlessly to advance the narrative without expository lumps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is high-quality with strong rhythm and density. Imagery is sharp and functional ("cascading water crystallized," "carry your purpose like portable luggage"), avoiding scaffold and clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a museum in a frozen grotto city is fresh and vividly realized. The synthesis of baking traditions with a survivalist ice-thaw plot transforms standard tropes into something specific.</comment>
