<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is legible, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("built from her own cowardice") rather than dramatized experience. The resolution occurs via a summarized list of corrected past choices rather than a specific, high-pressure decision on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure is strong, delivering a Decisive Change with visible, felt cost (weight, ache) that clearly resolves the premise. However, the bridge to resolution relies on a compressed summary of timelines that bypasses immediate causal struggle in the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The viaduct anchors the narrative effectively with vivid sensory details ("wet stone," "amber glow"). The specific imagery grounds the abstract timeline concept, though the "cotton candy and regret" line slips into unearned abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (wholeness vs. fragmentation) is clear, and the cost is paid on the page. However, the escalation is dampened because the protagonist's struggle is narrated as a montage of past fixes rather than a singular, resistant test in the present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of accepting mortality and consequence is coherent and lands well at the end. The score is limited by the explicit statement of the theme ("labyrinth... built from cowardice") which preempts subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the magical realist tone. Control slips slightly with "writerly" phrasing ("defiant rays," "cotton candy and regret"), but the rhythmic cadence generally supports the gravity motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and rhythmically sound, with high information density. Reliance on stock adjective-noun pairings ("defiant rays," "dying sun") and the "noun-and-abstract-noun" structure prevents higher marks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of technological metaphors ("algorithm," "procedural generation") with a fantasy setting offers a fresh, specific lens on the fractured-timeline trope. The execution commits fully to this hybrid logic.</comment>
