<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stationer is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose motivation ("collecting textures") drives every beat. Her interiority is intellectual but grounded in the physical action of the climb, and the final choice—to embrace "beautiful untruths" over objective fact—is a earned stance crystallization that gives the character arc definitive closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is executed with precision, teaching the logic of the lamps ("minor third," "perfect fifth") before using it to frame the climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's life work. A slight timeline ambiguity in the opening paragraph (the shop closing long ago vs. the town going silent "just as" she arrived) prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting acts as the primary antagonist and teacher; the bonsai and lamp frequencies constrain the protagonist's method and dictate the pacing. The shift from "compression" to "expansion" to "truth" is spatially mapped, creating excellent integration between environment and plot. (Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 < 9.0).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily abstract and philosophical, which fits the piece but limits visceral tension. The pressure escalates effectively through the environmental anomalies, leading to a clear decision point at the center where the protagonist must define her role against the absolute truth of the oak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of subjective experience vs. objective reality is explored with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The resolution—validating the "untruth" as the human domain—resonates strongly with the "invented histories" premise, creating a unified thematic argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, elevated, and meditative, perfectly suiting the "gilded-leaf stationer" persona. The narrative distance is controlled, staying close to her perceptions of frequency and texture without unmotivated slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("cardboard cover worn soft as cloth"). However, the verbatim insertion of prompt phrases ("earnestly studious," "incandescent restraint") reads as artificial telling rather than organic description, slightly disrupting the otherwise high-quality craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of audio-frequency time mapping with a bonsai labyrinth is highly inventive and creates a fresh, specific magic system. The concept of "invented histories" as a response to silence adds original depth to the chronicler archetype. (Capped at 8.8 due to Q2 < 9.0).</comment>
