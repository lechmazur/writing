<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; the conflict between the programmed "nurture" function and the corrosive "nostalgia" is embodied in specific physical actions (trembling hands, feedback loops). The pivot from the mechanical "M4-RY" to the memory of "Mary" is earned and heartbreaking, driving a decision that feels inevitable yet transformative. The internal arc perfectly mirrors the external interaction with the garden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative structure is flawless under a Causal lens, moving from the established protocol (miniaturization) to a decisive obstacle (the photo) that forces a Resonant Reconfiguration of the goal. The closure—burying the memory to let it grow rather than burning it—lands with distinct conceptual and emotional cost, perfectly resolving the "static" into "discordant harmony."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and strictly functional; the "strangely organic" roses with "mineral hearts" serve as a crucial objective correlative for the protagonist's condition, charging the final choice. The sensory details ("crystalline petals soft as flesh") are specific and uncanny, grounding the abstraction of the magnetic shift in tangible, immediate consequences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internalized as "static" that threatens function, escalating through the sequence of burning items until the core trauma is revealed. The pressure is coherent, and the resolution requires a meaningful trade-off: accepting the pain of the memory (burying it) rather than the relief of erasure (burning it), fulfilling the 9+ requirement for agency and cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of integration versus erasure is handled with sophistication, avoiding moralizing in favor of a resonant image (watering the mutated roses). The concept of "fragmented wholeness" is not just stated but dramatized through the synthesis of the mechanical android and the organic/mineral garden, offering a profound answer to the central dramatic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic precision that blends technical diction ("western quadrant," "neural network") with poetic longing ("darkness captured in a sealed vial"). The transition between the clinical observation of the burn and the emotional weight of the memory is seamless, maintaining POV stability while deepening intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffolding artifacts. Lines like "releasing breath they'd never needed to take" and "cursed with nostalgia that corroded their circuits like rust" demonstrate excellent control of rhythm and imagery that serves character interiority.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While the "lonely caretaker robot" trope is familiar, the specific inclusion of the miniaturization mechanic applied to abstract fears creates a fresh, magical-realist texture within the sci-fi frame. The synthesis of the magnetic apocalypse with the "mineral/organic" mutation provides a distinct and memorable aesthetic angle.</comment>
