<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira is a competent professional whose motivation is clear and consistent, fitting the archaeological tone well. However, she lacks internal contradiction or contradictory impulses; her path is linear and enthusiastic without a moment of genuine doubt or personal cost to deepen the characterization. The emotional landscape is often labeled ("felt electricity," "resolve") rather than embodied through complex reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal chain where the blackout necessitates the method that leads to the discovery. The closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting her role from passive cataloger to active participant. A minor convenience—locating the exact page in the dark immediately—slightly weakens the investigative causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the physical tilt of the building and the mineral deposits actively constrain movement and ground the sunken city concept. The specific sensory details (listing table, water dripping as metronome) create a tangible atmosphere that shapes the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (historical truth) is clear, but the immediate pressure is low; the storm provides background texture rather than forcing difficult trade-offs. The protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a dilemma, and the decision to preserve the truth feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle against an opposing force or fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving erased history is coherent and integrates well with the plot. However, the execution relies on explicit statement ("Verum Ante Omnia," "proof that some had fought") rather than subtext, leaving little room for interpretive nuance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, studious tone that aligns with the protagonist's profession. The perspective is stable, though it occasionally slips into slightly elevated, romanticized diction regarding the "rebellion" that feels distinct from the indexer's logical baseline.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally functional but suffers from moments of overwriting and forced phrasing (e.g., "pulse with significance," "swallowed"). The insertion of specific prompt phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") creates grammatical awkwardness and mixed metaphors that disrupt the reading flow in otherwise clean sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sunken library concept is evocative, though the "secret history discovered in a dystopia" arc is a familiar trope. The story executes the premise with competence and good atmospheric detail, but lacks a sharp, unexpected turn or conceptual risk to elevate it beyond standard genre conventions.</comment>
