<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies on summary ("finding comfort," "became an obsession") rather than dramatized behavior in a specific scene. Miren lacks internal conflict; her transformation is passive, resulting from touching a magical object rather than a high-stakes choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story violates the scope default by summarizing months of time ("Each morning," "As months passed") instead of dramatizing a pivotal scene. Causality is external and magical; the climax occurs because a speck appears, not because the protagonist overcame a specific obstacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is visually distinct, but the setting remains a static backdrop rather than a source of tactical constraint. The sensory details are vivid but general, lacking the "micro-setting" specificity that pressures choices in the moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; Miren faces no opposition, and her "obsession" has no on-page cost to her health, status, or relationships. The resolution is unearned, as the "message revealed itself" simply because she found the magic object, bypassing struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Themes of severance and repair are coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("It spoke of the Severance... but also of repair") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending resonates conceptually but lacks emotional weight due to the summary delivery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but distant, reading more like a fable summary than a lived experience. There is little distinct perceptual signature; the prose often relies on passive constructions to insert prompt phrases.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Prompt-stuffing creates logical and syntactic artifacts, such as the oxymoronic "moonstone cabochon dust speck" (a cut gem the size of dust?) and the awkward "hummed with mossy delight." These insertions disrupt the otherwise competent flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The concept of a sky-arbor and a "severance" relies on standard fantasy tropes without a fresh subversion. The seed-sorting monument angle is promising but is treated as a plot point in a synopsis rather than a unique, explored reality.</comment>
