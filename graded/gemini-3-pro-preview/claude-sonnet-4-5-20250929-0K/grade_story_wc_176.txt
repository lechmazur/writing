<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve lost voices is poignant and drives the narrative effectively. Her internal state is well-rendered, particularly the burden of memory and the release of forgiveness, though the pivotal emotional shift (forgiving herself) occurs in backstory ("yesterday") rather than unfolding under pressure in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, linear Causal arc with strong orientation in the icebound sanctum. The closure—leaving the bells behind to ring in the silence—provides a resonant resolution, though the lack of significant obstacles or twists during the ritual makes the success feel somewhat inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, with the "green fire" of the aurora and the "icebound sanctum" creating a strong atmospheric container. The sensory details of the cold, the rope's faded colors, and the bronze casting process anchor the magic in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the ritual process and the atmospheric response of the ice walls, creating a "Situational" tension. However, the stakes feel somewhat low as the magic works perfectly on the first attempt without forcing a difficult trade-off or threatening failure on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory, loss, and the transformation of grief into art is handled with sensitivity and grace. The concept of "transcribed memory" integrates organically with the emotional arc, leading to a resonant, if slightly sentimental, conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the magical realism genre. The shift from technical description to emotional release is managed smoothly, maintaining a cohesive tone throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the integration of the required phrase "technically gentle" in the final paragraph ("touched each bell technically gentle") is ungrammatical and creates a minor jar in an otherwise smooth finish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The magic system combining lost wax casting, braided rope, and punch cards to capture sound is inventive and fresh. While the "grief resolved by magic" arc is familiar, the specific mechanics provide a unique textural quality.</comment>
