<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Marina is passive; the advisor Theo drives the plot, provides the technology, and solves the central problem. Her internal state relies on the "tragic disability" trope without specific, embodied nuance or contradiction. The emotional arc is linear and lacks the friction of genuine character agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "magic laptop" device to instantly resolve the central challenge of translating silence to music, bypassing necessary struggle. While the ending offers a resonant reconfiguration (the camera click), the path there is frictionless and lacks causal density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The setting is established with stock imagery ("scattered diamonds," "silver under the full moon") that feels decorative rather than pressure-inducing. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a constraining force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>There is virtually no external resistance; the crowd immediately understands and validates the project, and the technology works perfectly on the first try. The stakes of "erasure" are raised but resolved instantly by external applause, removing tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Your silence is singing") rather than subtext. The narrative leans into sentimental inspiration tropes regarding disability, offering a tidy resolution to complex isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable, but the voice tends toward breathlessness and melodrama ("orchestra of absence"). The narrative distance is consistent, though it frequently summarizes emotion rather than dramatizing it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on clichés ("bloom like flowers," "scattered diamonds") and abstract telling ("joyful sorrow," "transcendent"). High adjective density and "purple" descriptors ("luminous" appears frequently) obscure concrete detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise of "translating disability into art to be seen" is handled with familiar, safe tropes. The execution lacks a fresh, specific angle, relying on the romanticized "magic of art" to solve structural exclusion.</comment>
