<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena is a distinct focalizer with a clear "memory keeper" voice, but her final choice to upload herself feels sudden and lacks sufficient on-page resistance or internal conflict. The motivation to investigate is strong, but the leap from curiosity to abandoning her physical existence relies on an instantaneous "pull" rather than a dramatized dissatisfaction with her reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and linear, leading to a definite closure where the protagonist undergoes a decisive change. However, the pivotal moment where the encryption opens "as if expecting her" bypasses a crucial opportunity for agency and problem-solving, slightly weakening the causal chain of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric specificity of the "ghost-light" archive and the digital "mathematical residue" is excellent, grounding the sci-fi concept in tangible imagery. The setting actively contributes to the mood, though the physical logic of the digital realm ("warm despite existing only as photons") wobbles slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stakes are high (existential transformation), but the escalation lacks friction; the obstacles (like the encryption) yield voluntarily, removing the pressure required to test the protagonist's commitment. The story moves from mystery to resolution without a moment of genuine doubt or jeopardy to earn the final transcendence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of digital afterlife and the "spaces between deletion" is handled with consistent, resonant imagery. The "sensed absence" integrates well with the plot, though the concept of the "old songs" feels slightly more like a prompt insertion than an organic thematic upwelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, filtering the world effectively through Elena's obsessive, archiving mindset. The voice maintains a melancholic precision that suits the cold-case subject matter, with no slips in distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong phrases like "mathematical residue" and "cascading backups." A few moments verge on melodrama ("humanity's childhood") or technical redundancy ("photons and projection"), but the rhythm generally supports the story's contemplative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a memetic hazard in a lost spaceship signal is engaging, if not entirely novel in the genre. The execution is competent, but the "digital rapture" ending follows a familiar path without subverting the trope or adding a distinct, unexpected layer to the discovery.</comment>
