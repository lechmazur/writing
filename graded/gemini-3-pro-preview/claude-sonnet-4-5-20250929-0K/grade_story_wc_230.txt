<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict is clear, but her shift from isolationist to healer relies on diagnostic self-awareness ("isolation wearing a protective mask") rather than embodied struggle. The realization feels filtered through analysis rather than felt experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure (Resonant Reconfiguration), but the climax dissolves into summary ("Word spread quickly") rather than dramatizing the pivotal first test of the relic. This reliance on montage flattens the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the instability of the "hanging orchard" and "rope bridges" physically constrains the action and mirrors the psychological fragility. Specific details like the "hemp ladder" and "storm-churned soil" ground the speculative elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are established early, but the tension dissipates after the decision is made. The resolution comes too easily via summary, lacking a moment where the plan is genuinely tested or risks failure on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of "useful fictions" is intelligent, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("She understood now that rationality...") instead of trusting the image of the reconciled father to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and appropriately analytical, fitting Mira’s character. The shift in tone from clinical observation to guarded hope is managed well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric ("iris of impossible green"). Minor reliance on cognitive verbs ("realized," "understood") to advance the plot dampens the immediacy of the character's internal change.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of the "truth virus" trope with a specific, grounded setting and a rationalist twist on the artifact's power. The "placebo" resolution is a clever, character-driven subversion of fantasy expectations.</comment>
