<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kasimir’s internal conflict between his failed revolutionary past and his current obsolescence is compelling and well-drawn. The shift from shame to a new kind of "emotional archaeology" is earned through specific memories and the interaction with the shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Conceptual Repricing arc, recontextualizing the ruins from wealth to grief with a valid felt cost (admitting his revolution's error). Relying on the protagonist writing his epiphany in a journal renders the climax slightly static, but the internal logic holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque setting and the specific imagery of the embedded shard effectively constrain the protagonist's focus and charge the final realization. The atmosphere of "frozen music" and "time-light" supports the thematic weight of the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The intellectual stakes—defining the meaning of a civilization—are successfully personalized through Kasimir’s history. The conflict deepens naturally as he moves from rejecting Vhen’s theory to reconstructing his own worldview, though the antagonist remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of integrating brokenness into beauty is resonant, but the execution leans heavily on the character explicitly articulating the thesis in his journal. This direct statement ("This baroque excess isn't wealth display...") reduces subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately tinged with the protagonist's poetic sensibility. The close third-person perspective filters the environment through his specific lens of regret and revolution effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and atmospheric, though occasionally dense with adjectival metaphors ("frozen music," "golden pollen"). The line "It made everyone philosophical" stands out as a weak moment of telling amidst otherwise strong showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synthesizing a critique of revolutionary clean-slates with sci-fi archaeology offers a fresh perspective. The "time-light" concept, while decorative, adds a unique visual layer to the theme of historical passage.</comment>
