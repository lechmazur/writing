<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clearly dramatized through the tactile interaction with the inheritance; the choice to spend the "unlived years" carries tangible weight. The internal struggle against the fear of the vortex is resolved somewhat efficiently, but the emotional logic remains consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a definitive Decisive Change—the ice melts and the inheritance is spent—with visible cost. The causal logic of using temporal mass to reverse entropy holds the drive lens perfectly from the inciting incident to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as both constraint and resource; the ice distorting stars into "strange geometries" vividly grounds the entropy concept. The acorn cap serves as an excellent micro-setting anchor that bridges the grandmother's past to the present action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the survival of the seeds—is tightened effectively by the "entropy sink" pressure. The climax offers a meaningful deepening of the conflict, though the opposition is purely environmental and abstract rather than active.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of stasis versus chaos is well-integrated, but the penultimate paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("by understanding that borrowed time must always be returned"). This explanation flattens the earned resonance of the final image and triggers the deduction for explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending scientific concepts with lyrical interiority ("tasted like metal and memory"). The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the high-concept magic system through Mara's specific expertise as a seed saver.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("tears of glass"). The specific phrase "furiously tranquil" is repeated, drawing slight attention to itself as a text artifact, but the overall rhythm and sentence variety are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of heirloom seed saving with temporal physics offers a genuinely fresh angle on preservation tropes. The concept of "unlived years" as a textured commodity used to restore entropy is ingenious and well-executed.</comment>
