<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mara is defined primarily by her condition rather than active agency; she faces no internal contradiction or difficult choice in the scene, functioning largely as a vehicle for the concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a flat "proof of competence" beat that lacks a decisive turn; the ending promises future action ("We start tomorrow") rather than delivering a closure unit with felt or conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The light painting studio is vivid and integral to the story's mechanism; the environment actively shapes the "somatic marker" method and grounds the abstract concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible as Dr. Chen's skepticism dissolves immediately upon demonstration; the scene lacks escalation, opposition, or a moment where the protagonist must trade something to succeed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of "body-memory" is coherent, but the conclusion relies on a summary statement ("hope crystallized") that feels unearned by the preceding low-pressure action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone suitable for the subject matter, though occasional ornamental phrasing ("fragile as willow branches") slightly distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the repetition of "fractally precise" (once in narration, once echoed in dialogue/concept) and the generic "something permanent, something strange" reduce density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of long-exposure photography, electrical rewiring, and the telepathy recall is a highly original and visually arresting premise that feels fresh.</comment>
