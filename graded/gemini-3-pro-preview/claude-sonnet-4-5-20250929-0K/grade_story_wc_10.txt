<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal state is clearly defined, but her journey is presented through summary rather than a specific, pressure-filled scene where she must make difficult choices. The character arc relies on a passive acceptance of the healing process—success is narrated ("Visitors entered," "People came") rather than earned through a dramatized struggle against resistance or failure in the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure violates the short-story scope by relying on an iterative montage ("most afternoons," "As winter deepened") instead of a singular, causal scene. This "synopsis mode" flattens the dramatic arc, as events merely happen in sequence without a tight because/therefore chain driven by immediate urgency. Closure arrives, but it feels like the end of a summary rather than the resolution of a specific conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the frozen, shattered conservatory with the vivid colors of the thermal imaging creates a distinct and memorable atmosphere. The sensory details of the "phantom thunder" and the visual heat maps effectively ground the abstract concept of emotional translation in physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>There is virtually no active conflict or escalation in the present timeline; the protagonist faces no opposition, risks, or defining trade-offs while creating the installation. The story describes a successful project rather than a crisis; the "stakes" are retrospective (healing from past trauma) and resolved without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme of translating trauma into art is coherent but executed with a heavy hand, relying on explicit thesis statements ("Sound isn't the only language of music") rather than subtext. The emotional resonance is forced through descriptions of audience reactions ("Some wept") rather than emerging organically from the scene's action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" descriptions ("pink dawn across her temples"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Mara discovered," "Mara could see") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is polished and rhythmic, but the reliance on summary necessitates a high degree of "telling" rather than "showing." The prose is functional and clear, though marred slightly by stock phrasing ("ravaged the coast," "clinging to debris") and the didactic nature of the exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The central conceit of using thermal imaging to visualize emotion is an inventive twist on the "healing artist" trope. However, the narrative trajectory remains predictable, and the execution—healing through a successful gallery exhibition—lacks a fresh structural or emotional angle to elevate the premise beyond standard sentiment.</comment>
