<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lyra is a competent professional who faces no internal contradiction or meaningful risk. While her expertise is rendered well, she functions more as a camera than a protagonist under pressure; she makes no difficult choices and pays no personal cost, resulting in a static character arc that relies entirely on procedural success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative line—preparation leading to a final effect—but lacks a complication that forces a change in tactics. The closure is a form of "symmetric satisfaction" where the protagonist intends to do a job and succeeds perfectly; without a felt cost or a moment of doubt, the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, acting as a physical constraint (the "threshold of stillness") that dictates the pacing and mechanics of the scene. The sensory details of the steam vents, temperature control, and aurora are integrated directly into the action rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Pressure is minimal; the primary opposition is the passive state of the dead, which Lyra masters easily. There is no active antagonist, time crunch, or resource scarcity to force a hard trade-off; the environment and the subject cooperate fully with Lyra's intentions, flattening the dramatic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding permanence in transience ("endings could still hold light") is resonant and clearly articulated through the imagery. The story stays focused on this central idea, though the execution leans slightly toward sentimental assertion rather than complex, subtextual discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric control that suits the ethereal subject matter. The shift from clinical observation ("oils distilled") to lyrical interpretation ("patterns in static") is handled smoothly, creating a unified perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and sensory-rich, with strong rhythm and specific vocabulary ("whale oil," "crushed garnets"). Minor artifacts like the zeugma in the opening ("anchored to... determination") and the cliché of the aurora "singing" detract slightly from the otherwise high density and precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a stratospheric mortuary utilizing aurora light is genuinely fresh and visually distinct. While the plot is straightforward, the synthesis of beauty, death, and arctic science provides a unique frame that elevates the material above standard genre fare.</comment>
