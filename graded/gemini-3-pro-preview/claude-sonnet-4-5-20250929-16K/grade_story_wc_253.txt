<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is masterful; the specific coping mechanism of self-narration ("She lifts the plate...") vividly renders her dissociation. The cessation of this narration at the climax ("She didn't narrate this") signals a profound internal shift without needing exposition. The contradictory impulses—to preserve the bouquet vs. to whittle everything down—resolve in a earned, costly choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative drive (whittling wood -> whittling self -> destroying the bouquet) creates a coherent, potent structure. Closure is decisive and costly, marking a shift from performance to presence. The score is capped just below 9.0 because the final sentence ("...permission to feel") slightly over-explains the resonance of the empty wall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The turbines are not just scenery but active atmospheric oppressors ("carving silence," "groaned"), grounding the "remade hush" in physical reality. The sensory details of the "manufactured snow" petals and the "wet, animal noises" of memory effectively anchor the abstract concepts in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established: the safety of the void versus the danger of authentic grief. The escalation is subtle but distinct, moving from the safe proxy of driftwood to the emotionally charged bouquet. The cost is felt—the loss of the brother's last tangible trace creates an irreversible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "remade hush" is powerfully explored through the narrative device and the whittling metaphor. However, the final paragraph creates a minor drag by explicitly labeling the thematic outcome ("permission to feel") rather than trusting the image of the empty wall to carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is a high-wire act that succeeds; the embedded third-person narration within the protagonist's dialogue perfectly mirrors her psychological state. The control is precise, and the strategic break in the pattern at the climax (silence instead of narration) demonstrates exceptional command of the tool.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong phrasing like "carving silence into smaller, more precise silences." A few metaphors feel slightly heavy ("encrusted with yesterday's optimism"), but the line-level momentum and clarity are otherwise excellent, supporting the story's stark tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story refreshes the familiar "enforced happiness" dystopian trope by focusing on the messy, numb aftermath rather than the rebellion. The specific combination of whittling and self-narration as recovery tools feels inventive and emotionally specific.</comment>
