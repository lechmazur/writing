<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The protagonist functions more as a thematic vessel than a living character; her internal state is static, lacking contradictory impulses or present-tense struggle. The "whistleblower" backstory explains her condition but does not drive a difficult choice in the current narrative window. Her acceptance of erasure is total, which flattens the dramatic potential of her isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story relies on iterative summary ("For months she'd been...") and generalized timeframes rather than dramatized, specific scenes. While the mosaic structure (tides) is legible, the narrative creates a distance that prevents the ending from landing with the weight of an earned, on-page event. The closure is a reaffirmation of the status quo (Earned Stasis) without a visible, paid cost in the present action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with strong, atmospheric imagery ("aluminum canyon walls," "barnacled secrets") that grounds the concept effectively. The sensory details of the port city are vivid, though the logistical mechanics of the protagonist's invisible survival are glossed over for the sake of metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>There is almost no active opposition or pressure in the present moment; the protagonist collects information without facing the risk of discovery or a dilemma that forces a trade-off. The conflict is retrospective (what the plant did) rather than immediate, leaving the narrative without urgent narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit summarization ("keeper of erased histories," "collector of toxic truths") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending tells the reader the moral significance of the character's life instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and moody, fitting the atmospheric intent, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought, writerly phrasing ("materialize from the salt air"). The distance prevents a deep psychic connection with the protagonist, keeping the reader at arm's length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but heavy on expositional scaffolds ("The bureaucratic error... had also freed her") that explain meaning rather than showing it through interaction. While readable, the reliance on generalizing summaries ("This was when they talked most freely") dilutes the impact of the specific dialogue fragments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "ghostly" observer in a marginal space is a familiar trope, executed here with competence but little subversion. The "legal death" angle is interesting but treated as a convenient plot device rather than a source of complex complication, resulting in a safe, standard execution.</comment>
