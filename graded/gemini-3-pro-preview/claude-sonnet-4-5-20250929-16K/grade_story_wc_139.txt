<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict—defined by her rejection of her father's deception while inheriting his tools—is sharply drawn and drives the central choice. The decision to log the retrieval truthfully rather than forge an excuse provides a strong character-defining moment that earns the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is clean, using the "active waiting" to bridge the inciting request and the climax effectively within the scope. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of "transaction" is transformed from illicit trade to honest witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details of the prep room (formaldehyde, drainage) create a vivid, morbid atmosphere. However, the presence of a vintage ink pot on a sterile funeral preparation workstation strains professional credibility and pulls slightly against the setting's realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes for Pavel are high and palpable, and the pressure of the vigil is maintained well. The resolution—that the honest path is also the legal/safe one—feels slightly convenient, deflating the potential cost of the decision, but it fits the thematic arc perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The exploration of honesty versus forgery is nuanced and well-integrated into the action. However, the final dialogue ("That's the only mathematics that matters") echoes the prompt's motivation too explicitly, rendering the subtext overt and triggering a thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, filtering the scene through Mira's specific burden of "inherited sin." The tone remains controlled and consistent, blending the clinical reality of the mortuary with the lyrical weight of the backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high density and effective imagery ("wind through mountain passes"). A few descriptors feel slightly standard ("indifferent, enormous"), but the line-level craft effectively supports the story's melancholic mood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a funeral home drama with a forger's legacy and political asylum stakes creates a fresh, specific narrative space. The specific angle on "active waiting" as a method adds a layer of ingenuity to the pacing.</comment>
