<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara functions as a plot device rather than a character with genuine interiority or internal conflict. Her motivation ("protect vulnerable voices") and attribute ("persistently curious") are stated rather than dramatized through difficult choices or costs. There is no friction between her wants and her actions; she faces no doubts or personal stakes in the rescue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The climax occurs off-stage and is reported via a phone call ("Twenty minutes later... they'd found Elena"), which robs the narrative of its peak tension. Causality relies on convenient access to medical records and an immediate, unquestioning acceptance of her supernatural claim by authorities, removing necessary narrative resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "mist-clad atrium" provides a coherent, atmospheric container for the story, establishing a clear mood. However, the personification of the mist ("trying to get in—or out") borders on melodrama, and the setting remains largely static rather than interacting with the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist faces zero opposition; access to restricted records is effortless, and police accept her paranormal tip without skepticism. Without obstacles to force a hard choice or a trade-off, there is no genuine escalation or cost, rendering the "incidental heroism" flat and procedural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "wholeness" and connection is handled with heavy sentimentality, lacking the nuance or ambiguity expected in literary fiction. The resolution ("heart she'd helped trace back to wholeness") is tidy and moralizing, reducing complex grief to a simple transaction of delivering a message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and competent but leans into "writerly" phrasing ("crystalline clarity," "reeling hush") that draws attention to itself. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone lacks the distinct texture or rhythmic variance required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is smooth but marred by clichés ("held its breath," "chest tighten") and slightly purple description. The pacing is functional, but the language does not work hard enough to create fresh imagery or subtext beyond the surface level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While the "contact tracer for hearts" is a timely conceptual label, the underlying plot is a generic "ghost saves living relative" structure. The story takes no risks with form or perspective, settling for a safe, linear trajectory with a predictable outcome.</comment>
