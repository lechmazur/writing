<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera is a functional protagonist with clear motivation and a distinct internal conflict (escape vs. duty). However, the pivot from near-suicidal escapism to benevolent educator feels precipitous and relies on a competence-porn trope (the expert trance) rather than a difficult, high-cost personal choice. The interiority is consistent but leans slightly into melodramatic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving cleanly from inciting incident (radio message) to crisis and resolution under a Causal lens. Orientation is excellent, grounding the reader immediately. The closure—an Earned Stasis where she accepts the burden—lands effectively, though the shift to transparency ("invite them to send observers") glosses over the logistical isolation established earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting of the floating arbor is vivid, distinct, and integral to the plot; the height creates the physical stakes for the parachute element. The sensory details (silver leaves, wind, static) effectively build atmosphere. The environment actively constrains Vera's options and mirrors her isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly defined (survival of the valley vs. Vera's reputation), and the pressure escalates appropriately with the council's doubt. The resolution—deciding to teach rather than flee—is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the ease with which she sheds her panic dampens the felt cost of the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of trust and responsibility is coherent, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("Some burdens were meant to be carried..."). This sermonizing summary in the final paragraph replaces dramatic pressure with a maxim, triggering a penalty for didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controls psychic distance well, balancing technical observation with emotional weight. The tone matches the high-fantasy/solarpunk aesthetic, though it occasionally strays into breathless melodrama ("crushing responsibility," "soundless echo").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent but suffers from clumsy integration of required phrases that creates artifacts. "Remembering through muscle memory" is a redundant tautology, and "Being attentively inventive had always been her strength" is a "tell" sentence that disrupts flow. These forced insertions drag down an otherwise smooth narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating arbor, radio tech, and pattern reading offers a pleasant aesthetic, though the "burdened solitary watcher" is a familiar trope. The execution is polished enough to feel distinct, but the core premise does not radically transform the genre conventions.</comment>
