<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dr. Khoury is a compelling, if archetypal, figure. The narrator serves primarily as a vessel for the mystery, lacking distinct internal friction; their skepticism dissolves too conveniently into wonder without sufficient resistance or embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The progression from mundane sugar-borrowing to supernatural revelation is structurally sound and well-paced. The transition from the summary of lessons to the specific scene on the rooftop anchors the arc effectively, though the inciting incident for the interrogation feels slightly low-pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, with the "cluttered apartment" and "rooftop garden" providing a solid stage for the dialogue. The "whispering walls" motif is a bit familiar, but the specific details of the seal and the meteors ground the scene well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear—truth versus comfortable pretense—but the conflict resolves with minimal resistance. The narrator's "interrogation" meets immediate compliance rather than evasion, reducing the potential tension of the climax. The cost of the revelation is intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of buildings as living memory is coherent and resonates through the final image. The "agreed upon lies" concept adds a nice layer of subtext to the relationship, though the ending tilts slightly toward explicit moralizing ("bridge between the living present and the speaking past").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but leans heavily on polished, writerly metaphors ("punctuation marks in a sentence") that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience. The repetition of specific phrases dampens the sense of a unique, organic perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent but suffers significantly from the verbatim repetition of the phrase "patiently nimble" (and "patient nimbleness") four times in a short piece. This loop acts as a distracting artifact that breaks immersion and signals a lack of line-level editing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise of an immortal tutor revealing history through architecture is a pleasant but standard trope. The execution is safe and linear; while the "agreed upon lies" angle offers a fresh nuance, the story largely follows an expected path to a gentle resolution.</comment>
