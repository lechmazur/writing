<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira functions as an archetype of the "wise teacher" rather than a complex protagonist; her "internal borders" and "resignation" are labeled in exposition but not tested by a difficult on-page choice. The students remain generalized sketches (the refugee, the farmer's son) serving the theme rather than generating friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on montage summary ("Week after week," "By November") to bridge the conflict, violating the requirement for a dramatized scene with causal drive. The resolution is reported rather than earned through immediate action, resulting in a low-stakes linear progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The zither and its rosette offer grounding specificity, but the broader setting leans on soft-focus descriptors ("amber light," "velvet embrace") that create a static atmosphere. The "velvet" descriptor repeats to the point of becoming a distracting artifact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is abstract and resolved via summary narration; there is no specific, high-pressure moment where the outcome is in doubt. The friction between "inherited loyalties" and "exhausted hearts" is smoothed over by the narrator without a visible price paid by the characters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly sermonized in dialogue ("Art teaches us...") and solidified in a final-paragraph moral ("The vanishing arts lived wherever..."), leaving no room for subtext. This didactic approach flattens resonance into instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly reverent, adopting the tone of a parable rather than a literary narrative. Dialogue is largely instructional, lacking the naturalism or subtextual interplay required for high-band execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished but suffers from decorative overwriting ("wore autumn like a shawl") and cliché ("voice like clear water"). The repetition of "velvet" (library, embrace, air) and "traveled stillness" creates unintended lexical redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The "music heals cultural division" premise is a familiar trope executed with standard inspirational beats. While the "subtraction" metaphor is functional, the story lacks the risk or non-obvious synthesis required to elevate the material beyond a prompt response.</comment>
