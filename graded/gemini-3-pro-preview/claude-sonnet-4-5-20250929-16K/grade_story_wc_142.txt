<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira is defined by her role, but her internal conflict is reported ("tearing her apart") rather than dramatized through hesitation or error. The "orderly intuitive" trait appears as a label to justify a convenient epiphany rather than a difficult cognitive process showed on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on synopsis-style summary ("Three months later") rather than a continuous scene, diffusing tension and breaking the short-story scope defaults. The resolution—a sudden cooperative proposal accepted immediately—feels unearned and lacks the procedural friction required to make the outcome credible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating carnival setting is vivid and specific ("underside of the Ferris wheel," "rope and trust"), grounding the speculative elements well. Sensory details like the paint texture and the precarious nature of the platform effectively support the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>High stakes are established but resolved through a low-cost intellectual compromise ("cooperative shares") that bypasses genuine sacrifice. The antagonist agrees too easily, reducing the climax to a polite conversation rather than a pressure-cooker confrontation that forces a painful trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of evolution vs. extinction is coherent but heavy-handed, culminating in a didactic speech ("reorganize together or sink separately") that triggers the Thematic Echo penalty. The ending explicates the moral rather than letting the final image carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and professional but occasionally slips into explaining the character's thoughts ("She had created this secret language herself") rather than trusting the action. The POV remains stable, though the emotional distance keeps the stakes intellectual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by clichés ("circling like sharks") and summary-heavy constructions that tell rather than show ("making gentrification sound like evolution"). The rhythm is steady but lacks the propulsive density required for immediate publishability.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a floating carnival city is imaginative and offers a fresh visual landscape. However, the plot follows a standard gentrification arc with a tidy "win-win" solution that lacks a fresh, unexpected twist on the premise.</comment>
