<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s internal contradiction—publicly performing destruction while secretly preserving—creates deep, embodied conflict that sustains the narrative. The decision to lie to Cassius ("Yes" to scattering) is a poignant, character-defining micro-choice that prioritizes his peace over his philosophy, revealing a complex hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative operates under a clear Situational/Hybrid lens, using the death vigil to pressure the reveal of Mira's secret practice. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the gallery's mission of impermanence is revealed to be a "mirage," recontextualizing the entire story with a felt cost of secrecy and "agony."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, anchored by the tactile "rhythm" of the rocking chair and the "compressed carbon" of the art materials. The specific detail of the "exhaust vents" in the back room effectively grounds the high-concept premise in mechanical reality, though the center room itself relies slightly on standard gallery tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are high and intimate: the mentor's dying wish versus the protagonist's emotional need to preserve. The tension escalates through the slowing chair, culminating in a choice that satisfies the mentor but burdens the protagonist with a permanent, reconstructed secret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "making peace with impermanence" is brilliantly subverted by the revelation of the masks, offering a resonant counter-argument to the stated premise. The story explores the "paradox of finding beauty in dissolution" without descending into abstraction, anchoring it in the physical act of creating the mask.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, matching the required somber tone while effectively managing the distance between Mira's thoughts and her spoken lies. The interiority is distinct, though the "voice like wind through hollow reeds" simile is a minor slip into conventional imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic ("working in near darkness, her fingers remembering"), with high information density. While generally strong, phrases like "voice like wind through hollow reeds" and "forgotten places" lean slightly into cliché, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ash-scattering and porcelain mask-making is a fresh, specific reimagining of the "art about death" trope. The twist that the gallery's "vanishing" is a constructed lie adds a layer of conceptual ingenuity that feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
