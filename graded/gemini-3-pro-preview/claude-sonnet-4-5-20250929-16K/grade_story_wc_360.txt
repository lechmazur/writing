<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict is compelling, but the pivotal realization relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I borrow personalities because I suspect mine is incomplete") rather than embodied struggle. The sudden, articulate self-analysis in the climax deflates the tension of the "uncalculated" fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is excellent, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist reclaims agency ("his own uncertain hands") with visible cost (the shattered fragment). The causal chain from Mira's intervention to the printing experiment is tight and logical under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "topaz workshop" under "unraveling heavens" creates a vivid, pressure-cooker atmosphere that constrains the action effectively. The sensory details of the cold metal type and the dimming amber walls successfully ground the high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the vanishing stars force a timeline on the protagonist's research. However, the interpersonal conflict resolves a bit too smoothly through dialogue, reducing the potential for a sharper emotional collision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme is imaginative but over-articulated; characters explicitly state the thesis ("Emotion has structure," "You're afraid your own feelings don't calculate") in dialogue. This reliance on thematic echoing robs the narrative of subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, successfully balancing the lyrical detachment of the "dead astronomer" persona with the underlying anxiety of the operator. The shift in distance when he drops the persona is handled with precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative ("grief exists in a clenched jaw"), though occasionally "tell-y" regarding the mechanics of the printing ("would disorient readers"). The density of imagery supports the tone without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics, celestial collapse, and the mathematics of emotion is fresh and specifically rendered. The concept of "transposed empathy" via typography is a brilliant, non-obvious engine for the story.</comment>
