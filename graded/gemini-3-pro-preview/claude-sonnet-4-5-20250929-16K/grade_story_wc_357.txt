<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Kael is competent and motivated, but her "intrepid" nature is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through complex choices. She follows instructions from the echo rather than deducing the solution, which limits agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and leads to a legible Decisive Change where Kael secures proof. However, the plot pivots on an exposition-heavy monologue that resolves the central mystery too conveniently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravity inversion and water roads are well-integrated, acting as both obstacle and pathway. The specific physics of the world convincingly constrain the protagonist's movement and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The time limit of the Turning creates effective situational pressure that tightens as gravity returns. While physical stakes are clear, the antagonism remains abstract until the final reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory and justice is present but delivered explicitly through the final line and the grandmother's dialogue. The result is a stated moral rather than earned subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, though the narrative voice occasionally slips into telling ("Kael wasn't just any pilot") instead of trusting the action to characterize. Perceptual details are functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains momentum with some strong imagery ("water... forming a sphere"). Occasional stock phrasing ("thunderous silence," "impossible geometry") and summary bridges flatten the texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of navigating water streams during gravity inversion is inventive and visual. The underlying plot of a hidden treaty and a ghost explaining the coordinates is more formulaic.</comment>
