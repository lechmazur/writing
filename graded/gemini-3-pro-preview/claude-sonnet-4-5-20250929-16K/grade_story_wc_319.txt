<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s feral physicality is effectively embodied in movement ("more fox than human") and perception, grounding the abstract premise. The internal transition from feral creature to guardian is earned through specific actions and the resonant realization at the climax. The cost of her transformation—becoming a "boundary" creature—is clearly felt in the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the realization that the garden is the library recontextualizes the entire setting and her role within it. The arrival of the pendant via unseen hands is slightly convenient, but the protagonist’s agency in engaging with it and accepting the burden of memory secures the arc. The lens holds a consistent situational focus that resolves into earned acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as both atmosphere and antagonist, exerting coherent pressure on the protagonist’s feral state. The imagery of "frozen roses... like thoughts trapped mid-formation" and "call numbers written in melting ice" perfectly fuses the garden and library concepts. The environment directly charges the final image, satisfying the high-band requirement for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes are existential and well-defined, pitting identity against the eroding force of the "wrong" dimension. The escalation is internal but visible, moving from passive waiting to the active reclamation of her role. The cost is legible: she does not return to a pristine state but must carry the "dimensional homesickness" as a permanent burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central theme of adapting to displacement is poignant, but the narrative explicitly states the thesis ("make friends with uncertainty") both as motivation and in the resolution. This overt articulation ("Thematic Echo") reduces subtextual resonance, flattening the emotional complexity into a summary rather than letting the imagery speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical melancholia that suits the dream-like logic of the world. While generally strong, the voice occasionally slips into abstract labeling ("interiorizing exteriors") that feels slightly academic for the established sensory-focused interiority. The control of distance during the transformation sequence is excellent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high-density imagery ("mist suddenly resolved into shapes—towering shelves extending infinitely") that advances the narrative. The phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is clumsy and abstract, clashing slightly with the otherwise grounded sensory details. Sentence rhythm effectively mirrors the shift from feral crouching to upright walking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a feral librarian with a frozen, dimensional boundary garden is a fresh and memorable concept. The "dimensional homesickness" provides a unique, specific emotional anchor to the fantasy elements. While the "cultist's pendant" is a standard trope, its function as a lens for the setting’s reality elevates it beyond a generic prop.</comment>
