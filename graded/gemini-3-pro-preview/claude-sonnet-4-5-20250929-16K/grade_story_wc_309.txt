<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Teryn is a clearly defined, consistent protagonist, but she remains static; she begins the story certain of her values and ends vindicated without facing a moment of genuine internal doubt or costly renunciation. Her struggle is purely external and physical, lacking the contradictory impulses or moral complexity required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is competent and the orientation is clear, but the trajectory is linear and predictable, moving from attempt to success without a decisive twist or complication. The closure acts as a validation loop for the protagonist's existing beliefs rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration earned through a new, on-page price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail is a strength, with specific imagery like "frozen fractals" and the "soft revelation of dawn" grounding the magical concepts. The physical reality of the "folly" keystone and the spire effectively anchors the abstract conflict between efficiency and beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptually clear but lack immediate pressure; the antagonist (the Academy) is remote, and the environmental obstacle (the mist) "accepts" her rather than forcing a hard tactical trade-off. The primary cost is physical exertion ("muscles burning"), which feels low-stakes compared to the thematic weight suggested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit sermonizing in the final third ("holding space for wonder," "passed the only examination that mattered"), which flattens subtext. The story explains the meaning of the moment to the reader rather than allowing the resonant image to carry the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical magical terms with lyrical descriptions effectively. However, phrases like "holding space for wonder" introduce a modern therapeutic idiom that slightly jars against the "ancient magic" tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and image density ("light chasing itself"), but suffers from some repetitive phrasing regarding "remembering." The reliance on abstract summarization of emotion at the climax ("Teryn felt something shift") dulls the impact of the line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the "magic as coding" trope is standard, the specific framing of the "garden folly"—useless beauty as a high purpose—adds a distinct and fresh layer. The execution relies on a familiar "underdog proves the establishment wrong" template without subversive risk.</comment>
