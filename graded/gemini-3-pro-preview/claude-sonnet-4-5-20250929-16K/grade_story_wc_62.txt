<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elena serves primarily as a passive vessel for instruction rather than an active agent; she encounters no resistance and makes no difficult choices under pressure. The mentorship is accepted without skepticism or internal conflict, resulting in a protagonist who observes rather than acts. The emotional arc is summarized rather than dramatized through embodied reaction or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a montage structure ("Each dusk that followed") that dilutes tension and renders the piece more like a summary than a dramatized scene. Closure is achieved through a lecture from the ghost rather than a hard-won realization or decisive action with visible cost. The pacing feels episodic, lacking the causal snap required for a short story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered with distinct sensory details ("rust-eaten frames," "orange light") that establish a clear atmosphere. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for dialogue rather than an environment that constrains choices or forces tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist wants knowledge and the antagonist (if the ghost can be called that) immediately provides it without asking a price. The lack of obstacles or opposing forces results in a flat trajectory where "escalation" is merely the passage of time and the accumulation of information.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly in dialogue ("Grief isn't contained—it flows"), turning the subtext into text and robbing the reader of discovery. The resolution offers a tidy moral summary rather than a resonant, complex image, reducing the thematic weight to a lesson learned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, though it occasionally leans into sentimental or breathless phrasing. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone lacks the friction or variation needed to heighten the stakes of the spectral encounter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is mechanically competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and self-conscious literary devices ("passing words... like bread"). Phrases like "thundering calm" and "fiercely meditative" read as strained efforts to force gravity rather than organic descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise of a craftsman learning a life lesson from a benign ghost is a familiar trope executed here without significant subversion or fresh specificity. The butterfly metaphor, while functional, feels constructed and lacks the surprising synthesis required for high marks in ingenuity.</comment>
