<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is excellent; Dalton's profession as a lantern broker deeply informs his interiority ("read what illumination revealed") and frames the resolution ("light in a careful vessel"). The emotional logic—testing grief against chemistry—is rigorous and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient and complete, landing a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist recontextualizes his grief. The failure of the physical test forces a decisive internal shift that is earned on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "mausoleum of extinct blooms" and the use of ultraviolet light create a specific atmosphere that directly serves the plot's central experiment. Sensory details highlight the contrast between the sterile present and the living past.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal but effectively pressured by the external "ticking clock" of the bloom. The climax—comparing the scents—forces a clear crystallization of stance, though the external conflict is quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of context versus chemical reality is resonant and well-developed. However, the protagonist articulates the thesis explicitly in dialogue ("It's that the smell remembers"), which slightly flattens the subtext at the finish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent melancholic precision ("grammar of loss"). The shift from clinical observation to emotional realization is smooth, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density ("clinical compassion," "wistful quiet"). The imagery of light and shadow is woven through the narrative without becoming purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—using UV verification and plant reconstruction to test the authenticity of a memory—is a fresh, inventive synthesis of sci-fi and romance tropes. It elevates a standard grief narrative into something distinct.</comment>
