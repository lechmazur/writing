<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maris is a distinct focalizer with a consistent worldview that motivates her urgency. The realization at the end feels earned by her internal logic, though the dialogue with Davin functions somewhat transparently to externalize her thematic stance rather than arising from organic conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative drive, using the storm's intensification to mirror the protagonist's deepening understanding. The closure lands a legible Conceptual Repricing—shifting the goal from preserving truth to documenting the act of remembering—with a clear intellectual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral, not just atmospheric; the "solid fog" and "shadow measurement" actively constrain the protagonist's method and enable the central epiphany. This integration of environmental constraint with the method satisfies the high-band requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but primarily philosophical; the urgency is stated ("desperation") rather than forced by immediate external consequence. While the internal shift is decisive, the lack of a tangible trade-off or active opposition limits the tension to the conceptual realm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but suffers from a "Thematic Echo"; the dialogue ("Not what was, but what we make of what was") explicitly articulates the thesis, stripping the scene of subtext. The story relies on the characters explaining the meaning rather than letting the imagery carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and precise ("summer-quill," "palimpsests"), suiting the archivist persona. Narrative distance is stable, maintaining a tight close-third perspective on Maris without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with strong imagery ("rippled like muscle"), though the verbatim repetition of the phrase "preemptively nostalgic" creates a slight echo effect. The rhythm supports the contemplative pacing well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central mechanic of archiving shadows against solid fog is imaginative and visually distinct. While the "memory is construction" insight is a familiar literary trope, the specific mechanical execution here gives it a fresh, tactile grounding.</comment>
