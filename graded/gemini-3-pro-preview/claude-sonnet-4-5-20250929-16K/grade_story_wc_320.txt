<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is competent and unified in purpose, but lacks the internal friction or contradictory impulses required for higher bands. Her journey is a smooth realization of a philosophical stance rather than a struggle against conflicting needs. The choice to stay is backstory; in-scene, she faces no distinct trade-off or difficult emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Conceptual Repricing ending, where the "noise" is recontextualized as interference. However, the lack of immediate, felt cost reduces the impact; the resolution feels like a pure gain rather than a complex reconfiguration of stakes. The orientation and causal logic are solid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, with the image of the city suspended on cables "thicker than redwoods" providing strong atmospheric grounding. The environment actively interacts with the protagonist's task (moonlight, gorge shadows), elevating the scene beyond a static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces a technical task rather than active opposition or a dilemma. The escalation is a smooth gradient of success—she tunes the dial and receives the signal—without a moment where failure seems plausible or a sacrifice is demanded to proceed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but culminates in an explicit summary ("endings were never final," "Every ending promised another beginning") that violates the prohibition against moralizing. This overt explanation in the final paragraph flattens the resonance, replacing subtext with a stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the "fantasy practicality" tone. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining a reflective and reverent stance towards the cosmic elements without slipping into unmotivated head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, though it occasionally strains for effect with dense metaphors like "shard of hush bloomed... like an inverse symphony." Syntactic control is strong, but the reliance on slightly abstract descriptors keeps it out of the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The core concept of a Hollywood star fragment as a cosmic radio crystal in a suspended city is inventive and fresh. However, the thematic conclusion—that endings are beginnings—is a familiar trope that isn't significantly transformed by the unique setting.</comment>
