<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Celestine’s motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction; her triumph over "conformity" feels idealized rather than earned through a painful trade-off or flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, but the transition into the magical realm relies on dream logic rather than causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strength, with the silver courtyard vividly rendered, though descriptions occasionally drift into abstraction ("pearl and promise") rather than concrete sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the "threads resisted" briefly, but the protagonist overcomes obstacles without a significant tactical shift or visible cost, making the outcome feel inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of autonomy vs. performance is consistent but delivered heavily; phrases like "truth beneath performance" state the subtext rather than letting it emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The elevated, mythic voice is consistent, though the prompt-mandated phrasing ("bodily poetic") feels slightly jarring and inserted against the natural rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, but leans toward "purple" abstraction; the density of metaphor softens the physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is an interesting magical mechanic, but the overall arc of the rebellious dancer finding truth is a familiar trope executed competently.</comment>
