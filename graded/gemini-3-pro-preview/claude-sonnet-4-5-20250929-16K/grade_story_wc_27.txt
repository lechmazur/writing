<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority is consistent, but the required trait "awkwardly confident" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through interaction or specific behavior. Emotions often rely on abstract summary ("righteousness without direction," "paradox of overwhelming peace") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative is a coherent vignette, but the closure relies on a convenient epiphany—ancient stones providing a mystical solution to a political problem—without visible cost. The resolution (planning to bring others to hum) feels conceptually light given the "gritty rebellion" setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like "skeletal frames" and "warm concrete" ground the sci-fi elements effectively. The contrast between the industrial rust and the ancient stones is vivid and anchors the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretical (the future of the rebellion) rather than immediate; there is no antagonist or active pressure in the scene. The escalation is purely internal, moving from doubt to certainty without external resistance or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly explained to the reader ("The rebellion hadn't failed. It had paused.") rather than allowed to emerge from subtext. This didactic approach flattens the potential resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suited to the contemplative mood. However, it relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she could see") which creates distance during what should be intimate sensory moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("sun-memory and star-promise") and abstract. There are mechanical repetitions in blocking ("She raised the opera glasses... She lifted the opera glasses") that stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "ancient mystical artifact saves the sci-fi rebellion" trope is familiar. While the specific image of the opera glasses is nice, the solution—standing barefoot to align with stars—feels slightly twee and lacks gritty consequences.</comment>
