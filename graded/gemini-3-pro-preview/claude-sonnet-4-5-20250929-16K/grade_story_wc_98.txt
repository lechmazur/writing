<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is functionally motivated by her role, but her internal state relies on the label "luminous doubt" rather than embodied contradictory impulses. Her primary choice—planting the seed—feels inevitable given her job, lacking a moment of genuine hesitation or high-stakes personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The causal arc is coherent, moving clearly from the diagnosis in the dream-space to the physical remedy. However, the immediate reaction of the dream-mist to the physical planting feels causally convenient, a soft-magic shortcut that bypasses the "weeks to sprout" constraint established lines earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The specific erosion of memory (a grandmother's recipe becoming "something sweet") is a brilliant, grounding detail that elevates the abstract concept. The dream-space itself is slightly more generic, but the contrast between the blooming ridge and the gray mist is effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The stakes are high (cultural erasure), but the pressure on the protagonist is low; she faces no active antagonist or difficult trade-off, merely a task to complete. The "doubt" mentioned is not dramatized as a force that actually impedes her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of specificity as the anchor of reality is strong and well-integrated into the plot mechanics without feeling overly preachy. The ending successfully resonates with this theme, validating the small details (honey, cardamom, Kael) as the victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism mode. However, the narration leans on "telling" via the prompt phrases ("empirically whimsical") rather than trusting the reader to infer the tone from the imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The repetition of distinct, polysyllabic phrases ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt") within a short word count acts as a distracting text artifact. These repetitions read as crutches rather than intentional motifs, marring otherwise clean prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mechanism of chemical anchors (fruit) for collective memory is an inventive twist on the "fading magic" trope. The resolution is somewhat standard, but the intellectual framing of the problem adds a layer of freshness.</comment>
