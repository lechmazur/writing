<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elena’s internal conflict between her scientific guise and personal grief is compelling. The pivot from skeptic to believer is sharp but anchored by the visceral intervention of her mother’s voice. However, the backstory justification ("DNA report") feels slightly utilitarian given the mystical shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, but the logic regarding the mother’s state creates a causal wobble: if she died three years ago, the mechanism of her being "taken before death" and returned to a different plane contradicts the established premise of the 17 physical returnees. The closure is decisive, but this foundational ambiguity weakens the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a crucible that enforces the story's "untamed" logic. The gravitational anomalies—vines curling upward, snow falling upward—charge the final image perfectly, and sensory details like the "inner ear ache" ground the supernatural in the physiological.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from professional curiosity to profound personal upheaval. The pressure points—Magda’s challenge, Tom’s testimony, the mother’s call—cohere well. The final choice to abandon the report for "metamorphosis" represents a paid cost, foreclosing her previous life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming bitterness into "cosmic jokes" is handled with resonance rather than didacticism. The juxtaposition of the flint arrowhead (ancient pain) and the phone (modern connection) creates a tangible symbolic language for the abstract concept of harmony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending scientific observation with lyrical receptivity. The shift in register during the mother’s call manages to be emotional without becoming melodramatic. Narrative distance is well-controlled throughout the transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and atmospheric ("frostbitten hope"), but marred by minor flaws. "Strange microclimate" is an expository tell that flattens the immersion, and the blocking of Elena dropping the phone then immediately pocketing its antenna creates a confusing physical gap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptozoology with a surreal, gravity-defying afterlife garden is fresh and memorable. The specific mechanism of the copper-wrapped cordless phone as a conduit for the transformed offers a unique twist on the "medium" trope.</comment>
