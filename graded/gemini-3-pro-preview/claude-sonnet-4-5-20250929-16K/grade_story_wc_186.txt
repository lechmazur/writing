<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mera is a distinct, consistent focalizer with clear motivation. Her interiority regarding the "language of pattern" is compelling. However, the shift from retrocognition to precognition at the closure feels like a reward granted by the author rather than a development earned by the character's on-page choices or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure (restoring the light) lands effectively. However, the central quest object—the shard of hush—is found in a flashback summary ("three days ago"), which drains the present scene of active discovery or problem-solving momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is established with strong sensory details like the "humming" walls and "diamond dust" on salvaged glass. The environment is integral to the plot, acting as both the instrument and the map. The atmosphere effectively supports the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes are high (restoring meaning), but the immediate dramatic pressure is low because the protagonist already possesses the solution (the shard) when the scene begins. The conflict is primarily past-tense endurance rather than an active on-page struggle against resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of coincidence as "meaning in disguise" is tightly woven into the mechanics of the plot. The metaphor of silence ("shard of hush") focusing light is a resonant concept that elevates the standard beacon-lighting trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the atmospheric nature of the story. The narrative distance is well-calibrated to Mera's solitary, observant nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished with good rhythm and density. A few metaphors lean toward the sentimental (e.g., "tiny parachutes of hope"), which slightly undercuts the otherwise austere literary tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>While the "lonely custodian of a beacon" is a familiar trope, the specific inclusion of sound/silence physics and the retrocognitive angle adds a layer of freshness. The execution elevates a standard premise.</comment>
