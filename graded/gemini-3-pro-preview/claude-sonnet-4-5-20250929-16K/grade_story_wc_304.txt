<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael acts as a competent procedural vessel rather than a character under pressure; she encounters no resistance, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no personal price. The required trait "lucidly watchful" appears as an inserted label rather than a constraint that shapes a decision or forces a sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural—a "day in the life" vignette—that lacks a complication or decisive turn to test the protagonist. While the closure is legible (the release of the body), it relies on a routine completion of tasks rather than a reconfigured stance or paid cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like "aurora-melt" and the "consecrated winds" create a vivid, specific atmosphere that grounds the fantasy. The environment actively participates in the ritual rather than serving merely as a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the "static" yields immediately to Kael's expertise without struggle or adaptation. The stakes are abstract (oblivion) and are resolved through routine competence, missing the opportunity for a moment where the ritual might fail or demand a higher price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of honoring the "lived radiance" of the dead is coherent and consistently developed, though executed with a degree of sentimentality ("You are seen. You are known."). The resonance relies on stated profundity rather than emergent subtext from conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent "radiant hush" that suits the subject matter, with stable distance and control. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" descriptors ("gossamer-thin," "ancient glow") that soften the edges of the prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies heavily on adjectival stacking and stock high-fantasy imagery. The integration of prompt phrases like "lucidly watchful" feels slightly mechanical, appearing as descriptors rather than organic parts of the sentence flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sky-burial, beautician work, and memory-tech creates a pleasing aesthetic, but the execution remains a safe, standard vignette. The story fulfills the prompt's requirements competently without taking risks or subverting expectations.</comment>
