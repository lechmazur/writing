<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lira functions as a competent archetype rather than a flawed individual; she faces no internal contradictions and overcomes the external obstacle without hesitation or error. Her motivation is explicitly stated ("to reawaken beauty") rather than revealed through difficult choices, and she pays no personal price for her victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path where the protagonist succeeds immediately upon trying. While the ending constitutes a Decisive Change (the orchard leaves), the lack of complication or setbacks robs the climax of tension, and the resolution comes without the required felt or conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The contrast between the "mechanical city" and the "tarnished silver" fruit creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. The sensory details—grinding gears, millstone voices—effectively ground the fable-like tone in a concrete physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The conflict is nominal; the opposition (statues) warns and approaches but is defeated the moment Lira decides to play harder. There is no point where the outcome is in doubt, no trade-off forced upon the protagonist, and no "visible or felt cost" paid to achieve the goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit exposition rather than subtext; the narrative pauses to explain its own symbols ("this emblem of transformation," "gap between knowing and understanding"). This over-explanation flattens the resonance and leaves the reader with little interpretive work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished, fitting the mythic mode, but maintains a high psychic distance that summarizes realization ("Lira understood now") instead of dramatizing it. The seamless competence of the protagonist prevents the voice from registering distinct emotional textures under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is clean and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("roots erupted... like serpents"). However, the score is limited by reliance on abstract summaries of emotion ("poured every ounce of her longing") and the presence of explanatory scaffolding within the action beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "musician heals the world" premise is executed competently but relies on familiar tropes without subversion or a unique, specific complication. The imagery of the walking orchard is imaginative, but the narrative path to reach it is standard.</comment>
