<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unit-47’s motivation is grounded in a clear conflict between function and sentiment. The decision to burn the cherished box of fears creates a distinct, character-driven beat with a visible emotional cost, effectively demonstrating the android's values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting magnetic shift to a decisive ritualistic resolution. While the link between physical fire and digital code repair relies on poetic logic, the closure (Earned Stasis) is earned and resonant, leaving the protagonist changed but functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details—the amber sun, the static interference, the oily smoke—effectively ground the sci-fi setting. The dome and the roses are not just backdrop but provide the necessary fuel and containment for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure is immediate and physical (paralysis), escalating clearly as navigation systems fail. The resolution requires a tangible trade-off—sacrificing the sentimental tether to regain function—which satisfies the requirement for on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of containment—managing chaos rather than eliminating it—is sophisticated and weaves tightly through the backstory and climax. The final image of the android tending new growth amidst static offers a nuanced, non-moralizing resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The POV remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the "glitch" experience through the android's sensorium without causing reader confusion. The voice balances technical diagnostic language with organic longing effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative and precise, but the prompt phrase "strangely organic" is repeated five times verbatim in a short space. This creates a significant text artifact that disrupts immersion and signals the prompt mechanics too glaringly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar android tropes with a specific, elemental threat (magnetic shift) to create a fresh scenario. The solution—a sympathetic magic ritual performed by a machine—elevates the premise beyond a standard survival story.</comment>
