<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara is a competent focalizer with a clear objective, but her defining trauma (the daughter) appears as expository backstory rather than a dynamic pressure on the present moment. The "modestly fearless" trait acts as a label rather than a driver of difficult choices; her interaction with the ghost is procedural and smooth, lacking the friction or internal cost that reveals deep character under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Causal line—problem, method, application, resolution—but the solution (showing the tooth) works instantly without complication or backfire. The closure brings a Resonant Reconfiguration of the harp's flaw into a virtue, but the lack of resistance from the antagonist renders the victory low-cost and somewhat mechanical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gorge is well-rendered, particularly the acoustic detail of the "spectral confessions" echoing off stone, which functionally supports the harp's mechanism. The setting actively participates in the plot by amplifying the problem (the chorus of grief), though the visual descriptions ("shadows pooled like ink") occasionally lean on stock imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the ghost is a puzzle box that unlocks immediately upon receiving the correct item, offering no genuine opposition or threat to Mara. There is no moment where Mara must trade one value for another or risk failure; the stake (the soul's release) is achieved through a linear application of skills without escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of integrating joy and grief is coherent but delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("grief and joy were not opposites but companions") rather than emerging implicitly from the action. The final paragraph summarizes the moral lesson, reducing the resonant potential of the image by explaining it to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift between the technical description of the harp and the lyrical description of the soul is handled well, though the tone occasionally drifts into sentimentality ("luminous ache") that softens the edge of the conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is fluid and rhythmically competent but suffers from "purple" tendencies and cliché in descriptive beats ("pooled like ink," "water over stones"). The phrase "modestly fearless" is an inefficient tell that blunts the immediacy of her characterization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central concept of a "misaligned harp" turning wrong notes into right ones for broken souls is a fresh and compelling synthesis of the prompt elements. However, the execution follows a fairly standard "healer cures patient" archetype without subverting expectations or adding a layer of grit.</comment>
