<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara’s internal state ("drowsy alertness") is well-rendered, and her motivation is clear. However, her arc is static; the climax confirms her existing worldview ("religiously skeptical") rather than forcing a difficult choice or transformation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Orientation and closure are legible, but the plot pivots on a convenient coincidence: the crucial radio confession airs at the exact second she finds the valve wheel. This "radio ex machina" resolves the mystery for her, robbing the narrative of earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "weeping walls" and the "beaded valve wheel" creating a distinct, pressurized environment. The setting actively constrains the mood and supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Escalation is low; the protagonist observes the climax rather than precipitating it. The resolution is delivered to her via the radio transmission, meaning she faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a high-stakes trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shift from supernatural haunting to collective psychological guilt is resonant and well-executed. The final realization ("the living haunted themselves") lands with conceptual weight, though the explicit statement of the theme slightly softens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, effectively managing the "drowsy" tone without losing clarity. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Mara’s sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but leans heavily on simile ("thick as wool," "like honey," "like a wire," "like sediment"), bordering on purple. The repetition of the phrase "religiously skeptical" (paragraphs 1 and 8) is a visible artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "ghosts as guilt" trope is familiar, but the industrial setting and radio-show framing add a fresh texture. The execution is competent but relies on standard genre beats.</comment>
