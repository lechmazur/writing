<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling focalizer whose professional expertise (neutron stars) creates a distinct, rigid filter for processing grief. The internal conflict—between her inherited impulse for control and the reality of "messy becoming"—is dramatized effectively through her observations. The shift in stance is earned and signaled by the physical action of leaving the dust on her hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative drive lens works perfectly here; the pressure builds not through plot twists but through the layering of dust and life. Closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Mara surrenders her intellectual defense mechanism (purity) for a messier truth. The "twenty-eighth day" butterfly serves as a resonant catalyst rather than a convenient fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting acts as the primary antagonist and teacher; details like "tomatoes growing from ceiling joists" and the "geological record" of dust are specific and thematic. The environment actively charges the final image, with the mixed dusts on her skin serving as the physical manifestation of her internal change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but deeply felt; the tension between the "skeletal" greenhouse and the memory of her mother's control creates a clear pressure cooker. Escalation is subtle and textural, tracking the shift from destruction to unexpected ecology. The cost—the loss of her orderly worldview—is palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and ecology yields a resonant theme of transformation. However, the final paragraph violates the "show, don't tell" principle by explicitly summarizing the lesson ("teaching her... that transformation need not be violent"), which flattens the resonance of the preceding image. Without this sermonizing coda, the score would be significantly higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and distinct, filtering descriptions through Mara's scientific lexicon ("striations," "preprocess," "variables") without becoming dry. The shift from clinical observation to emotional acceptance is handled with consistent control over psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no wasted scaffolding. Images like the "geological record of disaster compressed into centimeters" are excellent. The writing is polished and precise, effectively mirroring the protagonist's mind.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core synthesis—comparing neutron star collapse to the messy rebirth of a flooded greenhouse—is fresh and intellectually satisfying. The use of "dust" as a unifying motif for both cosmic and microscopic scales adds a layer of genuine ingenuity.</comment>
