<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Isla's motivation is clear, but the pivot to the "mothers and daughters" realization feels unearned by the brief on-page interaction. The reliance on the narrator stating she is "socially perceptive" rather than dramatizing the trait weakens the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is solid, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure where the tile is integrated. The concept of "unlearning" frames the arc well, though the coincidence of the woman's arrival simplifies the plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The acoustic properties of the grotto and the damp mist are well-integrated, actively shaping the atmosphere and the characters' interaction. The sensory details effectively ground the abstract concept of the "unlearning."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes of losing meaning are felt, and the pressure leads to a clear choice to abandon perfection for integration. However, the resolution relies heavily on the serendipitous arrival of the woman with the perfect object, reducing protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thesis statements ("the mess was the message," "learning to be daughters") to deliver its meaning. This didactic approach in both narration and dialogue undercuts the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality. However, the dialogue feels staged and expository, functioning more as thematic signposting than natural conversation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but relies on some clichés ("half-remembered dream") and shortcuts ("socially perceptive enough"). The description of the mandala is vivid, but the abstract telling weakens the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "semantic apocalypse" (unlearning meaning rather than facts) is fresh and intriguing. The execution is competent, though the "kintsugi" style resolution is a somewhat familiar trope.</comment>
