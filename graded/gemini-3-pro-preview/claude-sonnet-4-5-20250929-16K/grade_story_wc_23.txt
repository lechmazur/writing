<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara is a coherent, atmospheric focalizer whose internal logic ("solace in malfunction") grounds the piece effectively. However, the scene depicts a routine success rather than a pressure-test of her character; she performs her competence without facing a dilemma that forces a new cost or revelation, resulting in a slightly static portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative loop is legible and the closure (Earned Stasis) works within the accumulative lens. However, the setup regarding "weak signals" and "waning crescent" creates an expectation of difficulty that the smooth, immediate success of the phone call undercuts, making the initial tension feel like false suspense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "broken lighthouse" and "green-black" censer foot anchoring the ethereal concept in tactile reality. The atmosphere of decay is palpable and directly serves the theme of "patchwork navigation."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Escalation is mild. The protagonist faces no immediate obstacle in the scene; the caller connects instantly, follows instructions easily, and succeeds without complication. The "weak signal" constraint functions as background texture rather than active pressure, leaving the victory unearned by immediate struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding one's way back through memory is resonant, but the text relies on explicit labeling ("geography of loss," "coordinates of the heart") rather than trusting the dramatization. These interpretive summaries flatten the subtext into declared thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the melancholic atmosphere. It falters slightly with heavy-handed summary lines ("Raw and real, this was the work of return") that break the immersive distance to deliver authorial commentary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("fingernail scraping the sky"). However, there is a tendency toward metaphorical stacking and abstract phrasing ("slow violence of forgetting") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical failure ("hydraulics," "signals") with mystical/emotional navigation is a fresh, specific angle on post-catastrophe tropes. The concept of "reverse migration" is an ingenious narrative device that elevates the standard "search for home" plot.</comment>
