<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kaela’s physical adaptation to the frictionless world is distinct and grounding, creating a memorable embodied character. However, her transformation from elusive survivor to leader is delivered through summary in the final moments rather than dramatized through a high-stakes choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative builds effective pressure, but the climax relies on an "explain-everything" epiphany triggered by the star dust rather than a decisive protagonist action. The closure lands as a conceptual summary ("burden to blueprint") rather than a dramatized event, reducing the ending's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frictionless physics provides a brilliant, pervasive constraint that dictates the protagonist's unique physicality ("undulating") and grounds the speculative elements. The score is capped at 8.8 solely because Q2 did not meet the 9.0 threshold required to unlock higher bands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (survival vs. unraveling), and the "curse" adds effective time pressure to the scene. While the escalation is solid, the resolution dissolves the conflict through realization rather than a costly trade-off or sacrifice, softening the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of "borrowed dawn" offers rich subtext, but the ending flattens resonance by explicitly stating the thesis ("transformation, not ending," "show humanity how to swim"). This summary of meaning preempts reader interpretation and triggers the specific penalty for moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending the lyrical with the scientific ("collapsed star dust," "sacred geometries"). The focus remains tightly on Kaela’s perspective, maintaining a coherent tone throughout the transition from fear to purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with evocative imagery, particularly regarding movement and light. However, the climax leans on filter verbs and abstract summarization ("She saw it then," "It was about") which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a frictionless world where biology (eels) becomes the model for survival is highly original and well-executed. This fresh concept elevates the familiar tropes of cursed foresight and rune magic into something distinct.</comment>
