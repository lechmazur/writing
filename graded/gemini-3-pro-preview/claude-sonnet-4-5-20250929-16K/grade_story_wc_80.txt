<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Garrett is consistently drawn with a clear backstory and motivation, but his internal state is static. He enters the scene with a resolved philosophy ("understood his true calling" a year ago) rather than grappling with a live decision, resulting in a ritualistic enactment rather than a character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative is linear and anecdotal, functioning more as a vignette than a story with causal drive. While the closure (placing the note) is conceptually coherent, it lacks a decisive turn or felt cost; the protagonist simply executes a plan without obstruction or complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the submerged pavilion and the interplay of water and light are rendered with vivid, specific sensory details. The drawbridge mechanism effectively isolates the space, providing a solid temporal and spatial container for the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; there is no external opposition, and the internal struggle is recounted as backstory rather than dramatized in the moment. The stakes, while thematic (memory vs. oblivion), are not tested by immediate pressure or risk of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("archeology of abandoned dreams," "absence could be interlaced") rather than subtext or action. This over-articulation flattens the resonance, telling the reader what to feel instead of earning the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a meditative tone that suits the protagonist. The POV remains firmly anchored in Garrett's perspective, effectively filtering the environment through his professional and personal history.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, though occasionally veers into slightly purple territory ("columns listing like drunken dancers"). The technical integration of the surveying details with the emotional narrative is generally smooth.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of a surveyor hiding personal histories in ruins is poetic but executed with a "safe," sentimental literary approach. The story relies on familiar tropes of memory and loss without subverting them or adding a fresh, jagged edge.</comment>
