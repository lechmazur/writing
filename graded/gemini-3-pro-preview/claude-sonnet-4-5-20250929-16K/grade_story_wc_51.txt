<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal voice is consistent and fits the mythic tone, and the shift from collector to witness offers a valid internal arc. However, the agency remains largely contemplative; the final decision is a resignation to the premise (Earned Stasis) rather than a high-stakes choice forged in immediate, palpable pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, descending deeper into the grotto to a pivotal realization (Conceptual Repricing). The closure works as a legible recontextualization of her duty, though the lack of external friction makes the pacing feel somewhat uniform and the "cost" is purely philosophical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong, specific imagery ("bronze met bone," "oxidized glory") effectively grounds the surreal premise in tactile detail. The setting functions as a constraint, dictating the "orienting" mechanic that drives the action and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are abstract; while the tension between finite collection and infinite existence is legible, the external pressure is low. The resolution arrives through observation rather than a costly struggle, making the "trap" feel more like a premise condition than an active antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of interconnected suffering is resonant, but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("some traps were also sanctuaries"). This "moral of the story" approach undercuts the power of the final image, triggering the explicit moralizing penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the fable-like quality of the story. The meditative tone is controlled and maintains the "shingled hush" atmosphere, though it occasionally creates distance from the visceral reality of the weights.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is atmospheric and dense, but relies heavily on hyphenated modifiers ("winter-held," "boundary-lessly," "burden-weight"). While "boundary-lessly" is a prompt constraint, the reliance on similar compounds creates a slight textural drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of a bronze grotto where emotional weights calcify is imaginative and fresh. It effectively synthesizes familiar tropes (sin-eater, weaver of fate) into a specific, metallic aesthetic that feels distinct.</comment>
