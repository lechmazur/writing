<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Characterization is grounded in specific, lived history (circus details, lions), giving Mira a distinct worldview. The "hauntingly practical" trait effectively drives her unique method of grieving, though the emotional resolution feels slightly smoothed over.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds a coherent portrait of grief, ending in valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The "kettle" timeframe functions as an inciting clock, though the scene's energy dissipates slightly as the action extends well past the boil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and tactile; the "rain-beaded skylight" and "ash wood" grain anchor the abstract work of memory in physical reality. The sensory details of the carving process effectively mirror the internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (managing grief) is clear, but the conflict is largely retrospective and internal. The protagonist has already mastered her method, meaning there is little active resistance or risk of failure in the present moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "conversation not domination" is poignant and well-integrated with the backstory. However, the subtext is occasionally made text through explicit summary ("harvesting lessons from loss") rather than left to resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately meditative for the subject. It leans occasionally into "writerly" abstraction ("humble alchemy," "crystallized time") rather than staying strictly within the character's immediate sensory perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but suffers from lexical repetition; "patient" or "patience" appears four times ("patient authority," "patient repetition," "particular patience," "patient rain"), and "particular" appears twice. These echoes distract from the otherwise clean rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core concept—carving gestures and moments rather than physical likenesses—is a fresh, specific synthesis of craft and grief. The lion tamer backstory adds a unique philosophical layer to the standard "widow" trope.</comment>
