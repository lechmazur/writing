<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is exceptionally distinct; Mira’s "theoretical rebellion" evolves naturally into a responsible pedagogical mission (the syllabus). The internal contradiction of the father is mirrored poignantly in her own struggle, creating a deep, resonant psychological landscape that drives the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, moving from the inciting discovery of the notebooks to a clear Conceptual Repricing in the syllabus drafting. The closure is earned and intellectually satisfying, anchoring the abstract math in a concrete, forward-looking action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library setting is rendered with sensory precision; the rain acts as a cleaning force, while the candle lantern functions as a micro-setting that constrains Mira's focus. This constraint meaningfully shapes the introspection, elevating the atmosphere beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly defined: the reconciliation of a father’s legacy and the utility of probability itself. The tension between the "brilliant mind" and "damaged circuits" provides a ticking clock of sorts, though the conflict remains largely internal and reflective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thematic integration is masterful; the story uses probability theory not just as jargon but as a "psychological cartography" that illuminates the human condition. The ending resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal answer to the central paradox of knowledge versus behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is assured, blending academic precision ("regression to the mean") with lyrical melancholy ("watercolor abstraction"). The POV remains tightly controlled, filtering the world consistently through Mira’s specific intellectual framework.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically distinct, with high information density and no visible scaffolding. Images like "flowers held raindrops like tiny prisms" and the description of equations as "graffiti" are vivid and serve the story’s tonal needs perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While the "eccentric professor" trope is familiar, the specific synthesis of gambling addiction with a probability syllabus offers a fresh, intellectual angle. The execution elevates the premise, finding genuine emotional novelty in the mathematical metaphors.</comment>
