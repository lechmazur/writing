<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is well-rendered, and her motivation to transform trauma into growth is distinct and consistent. The choice to offer the pendant is a strong character beat that earns the emotional shift, though the woman’s rapid acceptance of the lesson feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, effectively utilizing the single scene to bridge the gap between past trauma and present healing. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with the woman’s departure, though the resolution relies heavily on a verbal explanation rather than purely dramatic action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral; the juxtaposition of the data center’s cooling ducts with nesting birds and moss creates a tangible atmosphere. The icicle patterns effectively anchor the thematic contrast between algorithmic rigidity and organic honesty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emotional stakes are high, but the conflict resolves with relatively low friction; the antagonist (the executive) yields to Mira’s wisdom without significant resistance. The tension dissipates through dialogue rather than a costly trade-off or difficult action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of organic healing vs. algorithmic harm is resonant, but the execution suffers from a "Thematic Echo." Mira’s line ("hatred is just another kind of algorithm") explicitly articulates the thesis, reducing subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled ("emerald silence"), suiting the tone well. However, the dialogue leans toward the artificial; the characters speak in complete, thematically perfect sentences that feel written rather than spoken.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("irregular constellations," "tomb of technology"). Rhythm is handled well, though a few phrases ("honeyed hush") skirt the edge of being overly ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of reclaiming a surveillance hub as a sanctuary for its victims is a fresh, specific synthesis of solarpunk and restorative justice tropes. The execution avoids cliché by grounding it in the specific metaphor of the amber.</comment>
