<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amal’s internal landscape is stark and compelling; the split between her "dead" rational mind and her grief-driven purpose creates a powerful engine for the narrative. The physical embodiment of her trauma (scarred hands, pressing against the geode) grounds the high-concept premise in visceral reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a magnificent Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing that feels both inevitable and costly; the choice to "make survivors of everyone" perfectly resolves the causal drive. The mechanics of the "unused potential" provide a sturdy logic for the awakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory creates a strong atmospheric pressure cooker, and the "cooling circuits" act as an effective micro-setting constraint. The sensory details of the geode ("purple crystals that caught the light like captured stars") anchor the abstract physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes escalate cleanly from personal obsession to existential threat, with the physical cost (altitude dropping) mirroring the moral threshold. The final choice forecloses the safety of the status quo with undeniable impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of violence creating a "mathematical ghost" of unused potential is a resonant, non-literal exploration of grief. The ending offers a profound thematic answer: shared trauma as the only path to understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific lexicon with poetic desperation effectively. The POV remains tightly focused on Amal’s perception, filtering the world through her specific loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The exact repetition of the phrase "bleak exhilaration" (paragraphs 6 and 16) creates a noticeable scaffold loop that breaks immersion. While the prose is generally dense and propulsive, "intangibly tangible" reads as a slightly clunky prompt insertion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum perturbation theory with the metaphysical weight of lost futures is fresh and distinct. The "revenge via reality fracture" angle transforms the standard post-apocalyptic survivor trope into something inventive.</comment>
