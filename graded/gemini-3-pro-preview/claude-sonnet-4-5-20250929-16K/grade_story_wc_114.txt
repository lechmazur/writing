<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s professional competence serves as the crucible for her emotional arc; the conflict between her "fault-tolerant" past and the new "marginal" philosophy forces a tangible change in tactics (recalibrating sensors). Her grief is not just felt but operationalized into a new method of seeing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Causal drive: the fever breaks, leading to the encounter with the illustration, which triggers the realization and the decisive act of recalibration. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of her forecasting philosophy with an acknowledged professional cost (false positives).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The weather station provides a stark, isolating backdrop that amplifies the theme of precision versus chaos. The dawn light through the translucent paper is a strong visual anchor, though the environment functions more as a container than an active antagonist in this specific scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stakes are clear: accuracy and professional reputation are wagered against the need to capture the "marginal" truth that killed Eva. The interaction with Chen sharpens this trade-off ("More false positives"), confirming Mira accepts the price of her new agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "margins vs. center" is tightly woven into plot and character. However, the ending drifts into explicit moralizing ("Some weights... not burden but ballast"), which summarizes the theme rather than letting the recalibration action speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, elevated register appropriate for an "oracle." The shift from the delirium of the fever to the cold clarity of the decision is managed well within the third-person limited perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and polished, with high density. A few metaphors lean toward the conventional ("stone" in the throat, grief as "ballast"), and the final paragraph creates a slight drag by explaining the emotional resonance rather than ending on the image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizing weather forecasting logic with botanical illustration offers a fresh lens on the grief narrative. While the emotional conclusion (grief as ballast) is a familiar trope, the specific execution through the "error margins" of science is distinct.</comment>
