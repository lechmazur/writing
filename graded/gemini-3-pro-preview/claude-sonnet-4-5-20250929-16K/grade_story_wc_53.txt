<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kera’s internal struggle is vivid, and the externalization of her past self creates a functional "relationship as crucible." The motivation to reclaim agency is consistent, and the shift from avoidance to engagement is earned by the interaction with the object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Structure is sound, using the discovery of the wheel as a clear inciting incident that drives a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The shift from paralysis to "modest platforms" lands with legible conceptual cost (scaling down ambition to make it achievable).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "kinetic lagoon" is a distinct, surreal environment that enables the floating mechanics fundamental to the story's logic. The camera wheel serves as a precise micro-setting and tool that constrains the interaction and drives the central metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Coherent pressure centers on the conflict between past ambition and present inertia. The cost is legible—accepting "small gardens" over the promised city—though the ghost remains somewhat passive, limiting the dynamic range of the negotiation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of compromised ambition versus stagnation is well-developed without becoming didactic. The final image of "blueprints reflected, eroded but still legible" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the surreal setting. Narrative distance is controlled, though some phrasing leans slightly melodramatic ("weight of decades," "mockery of her own stillness") rather than grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm is solid, but the text relies on sensory and metaphorical clichés ("regret tasted like copper," "slipped through her fingers") that dull the line-level impact. These artifacts prevent higher placement despite clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of the camera wheel winding forward is a fresh, tactile twist on the "confronting past self" trope. This specific detail elevates the otherwise familiar "scavenger of memories" premise.</comment>
