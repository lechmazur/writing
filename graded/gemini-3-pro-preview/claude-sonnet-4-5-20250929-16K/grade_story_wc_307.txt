<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Keiran's backwards aging is a compelling, specific trait that mirrors the theme of "unbecoming" effectively. Maia's motivation relies on summarized backstory ("family's scandal") rather than on-page pressure, making her internal state feel slightly abstract until the final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The structure is a clean, linear instructional scene that successfully delivers a Conceptual Repricing closure. However, the climax relies on the mentor explicitly explaining the epiphany ("The delayed revelation is...") rather than the protagonist earning it solely through the sensory experience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "magnetic grotto" lighting the ripples integrates perfectly with the lesson, turning the environment into a necessary tool for the metaphor. The atmosphere is distinct and supports the meditative tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes remain largely philosophical and internal; while the intellectual conflict is clear, the scene lacks urgent external pressure or a concrete cost of failure. The tightening comes from the lesson's progression rather than a forced choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central theme of presence within absence is coherent, but subtext is undercut by the character explicitly articulating the thesis in dialogue ("The delayed revelation is that you were never meant to vanish"). This direct statement flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, contemplative distance that suits the subject matter. The focus remains tightly on Maia's perception of the lesson, though the filter is occasionally passive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and atmospheric, but the distinct phrase "sycamore hush" is repeated verbatim in paragraphs 2 and 13, creating a noticeable loop artifact. Imagery is otherwise strong ("erosion in reverse").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a backwards-aging teacher adds a fresh layer to the "wise mentor on a floating rock" trope. However, the execution follows a standard lesson-story beat sheet without significant structural risk.</comment>
