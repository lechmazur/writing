<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya creates a functional focal point, but her complexity relies on exposition ("helix-minded," "difficult person to understand") rather than dramatized behavior. Her internal conflict is resolved via a convenient realization rather than a struggle between incompatible needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path of discovery, but the closure lacks a felt cost; Maya simply decides to fix the problem and succeeds. The resolution ("returning dreams") feels like an abstract conceptual upgrade rather than a hard-won consequence of the scene's pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The canyon provides an atmospheric backdrop, and the "skull" metaphor works well with the memory theme. However, the setting remains largely static and does not constrain Maya’s choices or tactics beyond hiding the equipment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Escalation is low-friction; the danger of "recursive loops" is stated as a condition but does not actively jeopardize the outcome in the scene. The conflict resolves through an intellectual epiphany rather than a pressure-tested choice involving sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of "abandoned dreams" is coherent but delivered through explicit summary ("she understood that what people discarded often mattered more") rather than emergent subtext. The ending leans into sentimental assertion without engaging the potential downsides or costs of the technology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and controls the technical jargon well, though it sometimes slips into explanatory interiority. The perspective stays firmly with Maya, but the distance creates a filter that mutes the visceral impact of the "entangled memories."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm, though occasionally adjective-heavy ("silver light in chaotically precise patterns"). The mandatory phrase "quaking reverie" stands out as slightly purple but is integrated grammatically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of using a broken mirror for "oblique observation" of memory is inventive. However, the resolution—converting data back into "possibilities" for the subjects—is a familiar trope in empathetic sci-fi that softens the story's potential edge.</comment>
