<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Mara is competent but static; she faces no internal friction or genuine doubt. Her defining trait (laughter) feels performative rather than driven by character depth, and her "prophetic" nature is asserted by the narrator rather than demonstrated through difficult choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is functional but linear, lacking a sharp causal turn. The inclusion of the salvage captain's perspective relies on unearned omniscience that disconnects from the protagonist's agency. Closure lands as Earned Stasis but feels low-stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the glass wick and jade walls grounding the magical elements in tactile detail. The environment successfully constrains the ritual, though some descriptors ("carved jewel," "star-scattered") lean slightly purple.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>External pressure (the storm) is "greeted like an old friend" rather than battled, draining tension. The protagonist succeeds too easily with no visible personal cost or sacrifice on the page; the stakes for the salvage captain remain off-screen and abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of using "ancient shadows" to shape the new is coherent and resonates in the final image. However, the commentary on the "fast, flashier ways of knowing" feels a bit heavy-handed and expository.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose generally maintains a consistent tone, but the sudden shift to omniscience ("She didn't know—couldn't have known...") disrupts the established limited POV. This unmotivated breach distances the reader from Mara's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm and flow are strong, with effective imagery ("drank it, held it"). There is a tendency toward telling over showing in the reflective beats ("tingled with unintended significance"), but line-level craft is otherwise solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "magical lighthouse keeper" is a familiar trope, though the specific physics of the glass wick and total internal reflection add a fresh sci-fi layer. The narrative execution follows a safe, standard path.</comment>
