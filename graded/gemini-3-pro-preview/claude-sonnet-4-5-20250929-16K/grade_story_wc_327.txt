<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maerith’s obsession is compelling, and her motivation to preserve the language drives the narrative effectively. However, the emotional cost ("sanity") is summarized by the narrator rather than dramatized in the present action. The backstory of her family provides context but feels somewhat detached from her current, highly technical struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Over the following months," "She had studied... for years") to bridge key moments, which dilutes the immediacy of the "continuous scene" or "mosaic" requirement. The closure is strong, offering a Conceptual Repricing of language, but the path there lacks a dramatized pressure cooker effect due to the time jumps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the bone towers and canyon of echoes function as necessary acoustic tools, not just backdrop. The sensory details ("microscopic ridges," "pure reverberation") are vivid and support the textural theme. The environment actively constrains and enables the protagonist's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high conceptually (extinction of a language), but the conflict is largely internal and intellectual. The escalation moves through successful experiments rather than forced trade-offs or rising opposition. The stated cost of "sanity" is not visibly paid on the page, resulting in a lower sense of immediate peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of translating ephemeral sound into permanent texture is executed with profound resonance. The ending recontextualizes the loss of the spoken language into a new, tactile form of survival (Conceptual Repricing). The integration of the bird patterns into the linguistic theory is thematically elegant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately contemplative for the scholar-protagonist. There is a slight tendency toward omniscient summary ("She knew she would not live...") that creates distance, but the tone generally matches the atmospheric intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and precise ("meaning dissolved into pure reverberation"), fitting the subject matter. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She knew," "She felt") distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience. Reducing these filters would sharpen the impact of her discoveries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central concept of encoding language into texture via acoustic geology is highly original and imaginative. The synthesis of linguistics, ornithology, and acoustics creates a fresh, non-obvious narrative premise that avoids standard fantasy tropes.</comment>
