<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina is a compelling vessel for the premise, but she functions more as a thematic catalyst than a struggling protagonist; her wisdom feels pre-packaged rather than earned in the moment. Thomas provides necessary grounding, but the dynamic lacks the friction of genuine conflict, resolving through her guidance rather than mutual struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the "living obituary" concept frames the encounter well, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the turning point relies heavily on a monologue to dissolve the obstacle, lacking a sharp causal "click" where a difficult choice forces the outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is strong; details like "bronze leaves" and the smell of "camphor" effectively ground the magical realism. The setting mirrors the internal state of the characters without overpowering the narrative focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clear but purely internal, and the resolution comes too smoothly; Marina faces no risk of failure, and Thomas's resistance yields to a single speech. The absence of external pressure or a cost paid within the scene keeps the tension relatively low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of "living obituaries" is profound, but the theme is undercut by explicit articulation in dialogue ("I travel to understand the geography of healing"). This "Thematic Echo" explains the subtext to the reader rather than trusting the dramatization to convey it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the material. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into stylized prose poetry ("echoing in her bones" in narration, "lonesome splendor" in description), distancing the reader from the characters' immediate reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from a few darling phrases and high metaphor density. Notably, the phrase "lonesome splendor" appears in both a dialogue tag and the narration, a repetitive artifact that breaks the immersive spell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central hook—an obituary writer for the living—is imaginative and distinct. The execution, while competent, follows a somewhat standard "wise wanderer heals sad artisan" template, relying on the strength of the concept to carry the emotional weight.</comment>
