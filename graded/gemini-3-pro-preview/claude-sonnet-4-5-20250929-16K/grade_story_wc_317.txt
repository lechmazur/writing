<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miranda functions as a vehicle for the plot rather than a fully realized character; her trait of being "receptive to signs" is stated as a label rather than dramatized through complex choice. Her emotional reaction to the mentor's revelation is summarized, which flattens the potential for genuine interiority or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary to cover a multi-month timeline, reading more like a synopsis than a dramatized story, which violates the scope defaults for this length. A significant logic gap exists: Miranda designs a puzzle about the sender's identity, implying she solved the mystery off-page, yet the narrative never shows this discovery, stripping the climax of causal validity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the mill and the "nocturnal haven" are effective, and the sensory description of the corpse flower blooming is vivid. However, the descriptions of the "intricate puzzles" remain vague and abstract, missing an opportunity to ground the setting in tactile interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the stakes of corporate buyout are clear, the conflict is conveyed through summary ("buyers called again") rather than immediate scenes with rising pressure. The resolution feels inevitable due to the "magical" success of the flower, rather than being earned through a difficult, on-page decision by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of organic innovation versus corporate soullessness is legible but delivered through explicit exposition rather than subtext. The ending leans into moralizing ("permission... like protection"), and the mentor's message feels convenient rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but frequently drifts into overwrought, adjectival description ("pregnant with transformation," "leaves unfurling like dark secrets"). The tone matches the gothic mystery intent but lacks the rhythmic variety and restraint needed for higher literary quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing (using "orthogonal" twice in similar contexts) and reliance on clichés ("storm-born silence," "eternal song"). The reliance on summary telling over showing significantly reduces information density and momentum in the middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of a corpse flower as a centerpiece for an escape room is novel and visually distinct. However, the execution relies on standard tropes—the benevolent deceased mentor and the evil corporate chain—without subverting them or adding a fresh, specific twist to the resolution.</comment>
