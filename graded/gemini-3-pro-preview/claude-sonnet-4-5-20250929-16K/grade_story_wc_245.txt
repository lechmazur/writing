<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, sensory-grounded focalizer, and her internal state is clear. However, her journey lacks active agency beyond the initial decision to dowse; she follows a trail laid out for her rather than making difficult trade-offs or choices under pressure. The emotional arc is resolved through realization rather than a dramatized decision between conflicting values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and orientation is solid, with a clear trajectory from seeking to finding. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path from A to B is linear and lacks significant obstacles or causal turns that would heighten the sense of earned achievement. The "cost" is largely abstract effort rather than a specific price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sensory translation of the "ultrasonic" forest through touch and vibration is excellent, grounding the high-concept setting in the protagonist's specific physical limitations. The environment actively constrains her perception and method of travel, fulfilling the criteria for a strong setting score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (finding peace), but the conflict is low-friction; the ring simply pulls harder and she follows. There is no moment where the protagonist must overcome a significant snag, make a hard sacrifice, or adapt her tactics against active opposition, making the escalation feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief's topography is evocative but undermined by explicit telling, particularly the paragraph explaining what the forest was "teaching her" ("that there was no map through grief"). This diagnostic summary flattens the subtext, converting potential resonance into a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a strong, distinct perceptual signature suited to the blind protagonist. The shift from auditory to tactile imagery is handled with control, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly melodramatic territory ("shattered glass," "conflagration").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally obscures the immediate action ("syntax of sorrow, a grammar of waiting"). While mechanically sound, the reliance on abstract emotional metaphors weakens the visceral impact of the physical journey.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind mapmaker with an ultrasonic forest is a fresh, specific concept that creates a unique navigational mode. The execution is earnest and the "stillpoint" trope is revitalized through the specific vibrational imagery.</comment>
