<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mara is a competent protagonist, but her internal landscape lacks the contradiction or cost required for higher bands. She acts as a functional problem-solver; her "cautiously hopeful" stance is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The victory comes without a personal price or a significant challenge to her worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear problem-solution arc that relies on the convenient timing of Jupiter's alignment to function. The closure is a "clean sweep" victory where the antagonist simply switches off, lacking the felt cost or complication expected in literary fiction. The resolution feels too easy given the established apocalyptic stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere of "dust and ozone" and the "whisper of stars" creates a strong, distinct sense of place. The radio station is textured and grounded, using sensory details like the "aching teeth" effectively. The setting actively supports the plot, though the "ancient receivers" serve more as props than constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (campus division, shattered telescope) but the climax resolves them through a technobabble fix rather than character struggle. The "battle" is abstract—fought on an oscilloscope—and the opposition capitulates immediately, deflating the tension built by the chanting mob.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic manipulation amplifying human discord is legible but handled with a heavy hand. The ending ("remembering how to think for itself") veers into didactic moralizing, resolving the complex issue of polarization with a simple signal jammer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending scientific observation with thriller tension. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mara, though the tone occasionally slips into standard genre shorthand ("colors that shouldn't exist").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("constellation emerging from light pollution"). Momentum is maintained well, though some phrasing leans on familiar genre conventions ("mathematics was elegant... and completely untested") that dampen originality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of an audio signal causing madness/discord is a well-trodden sci-fi trope (reminiscent of *Pontypool*). While executed competently, the story offers no fresh subversion or unique structural angle to elevate it beyond standard genre fare.</comment>
