<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus is a consistent protagonist whose professional traits (indexing, methodical patience) drive the action. His motivation to uncover the truth is clear and links to his grandmother’s backstory without overwhelming the present scene. The attribute "tranquilly perceptive" feels slightly inserted as a label rather than purely demonstrated, but his behavior under pressure aligns with the trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal drive: blackout -> access -> discovery -> threat -> escape. The closure works well as a Charged Poise moment, where the protagonist sits ready with the truth, reconfiguring the initial stillness into resistance. The retrieval of the file is slightly convenient (third cabinet), but the pacing handles the short form well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken city atmosphere is established quickly and effectively with details like "pressure-groan" and "reinforced glass." The setting actively constrains the protagonist, forcing reliance on the headlamp and heightening the tension of the approaching footsteps. The library feels lived-in and specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, and the blackout raises the immediate physical pressure. The "footsteps" beat provides a necessary escalation, though it is a fairly standard thriller trope. The cost is primarily the risk taken rather than a price paid on the page, but the final stance of resistance feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus erasure is well-integrated with the setting and plot. The ink stamp serves as a solid objective correlative for the grandmother’s struggle, grounding the abstract conspiracy in a tangible object. The final reflection on stillness not being silence resonates nicely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent close-third distance. However, the integration of required phrases results in some modifier stacking ("tranquilly perceptive focus") that feels slightly mechanical. The tone matches the "stillness" of the setting effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and functional, with good rhythm in the action beats. However, the forced insertion of prompt phrases like "dappled resolve" creates awkward metaphorical confusion (resolve can be dappled, but here it reads as an artifact). Some phrasing leans toward adjectival telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of a sunken city archive and a conspiracy regarding its flooding is a familiar trope in speculative fiction. While executed competently, the story follows a standard retrieval-mission structure without subverting expectations or offering a unique conceptual twist beyond the atmospheric setting.</comment>
