<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maya’s obsession is beautifully embodied in the tapping compulsion, which physically bridges her internal anxiety with the external tidal rhythm. Her motivation is sharp and professional, driven by a specific history (graduate student witnessing bleaching) that grounds the high-concept stakes in personal loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from a specific mystery (missing whales) to a profound Conceptual Repricing of what "recovery" means. The use of the atlas as a pivot point is convenient but earned by the setting's history, and the closure lands with the weight of a paradigm shift rather than just a plot solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is active and pressuring; the "groaning" stilts and the swaying station reinforce the theme of instability versus anchorage. The description "vigil than science" efficiently establishes the atmospheric dread and the station's repurposing post-ban.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily epistemic but feel urgent due to the "vigil" context; the tension between the data (emptiness) and the intuition (return) drives the scene. The escalation focuses on the interpretation of data, which fits the hard sci-fi tone, though the interpersonal friction with Jin is functional rather than deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis is exceptional; the redefinition of "recovery" not as a return to the status quo but as a reversion to deep time is a stunning Conceptual Repricing. The recurring motif of "periodically eternal" transforms from a paradox into a revelation about the ocean's memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, blending scientific precision with lyricism ("thoughts tangled like kelp") without breaking character. The pacing mimics the "three-two" rhythm mentioned in the text, creating a strong cohesion between form and content.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density; the line "vigil than science" is a standout example of economy. No artifacts or loops; the sentence structures vary purposefully to match the swaying, meditative tone of the station.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inversion of the "climate recovery" trope—viewing healing as a return to pre-human patterns that look like loss to modern observers—is a fresh, specific angle. The integration of the tapping habit with the tidal data adds a layer of ingenious texture.</comment>
