<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya serves as a competent observer, but her primary action—placing the root—relies on a serendipitous find rather than a difficult choice or character-specific struggle. The internal realization feels asserted through exposition ("Maya realized") rather than earned through emotional or physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a significant coincidence (finding the exact orris root needed on the beach that morning) to resolve the central mystery, which undercuts the causal chain. While the closure (the house exhaling) is resonant, the mechanism to achieve it lacks earned agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is lush and evocative, effectively using sensory details (scent, sound) to ground the magical realism. The house functions well as a constraint, though the prose occasionally leans toward the ornamental ("streetlights daydreamed").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain low and abstract throughout; the "tension" is purely atmospheric ("house held its breath") with no visible cost or risk to the protagonist. The resolution comes without a demand for sacrifice or significant trade-off, limiting the dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of structural memory is coherent and poetic, but the delivery is heavy-handed, relying on explicit summary ("Houses feel alive when they remember") rather than subtextual emergence. The epiphany is told to the reader rather than experienced through the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lyrical, contemplative voice fits the genre well, maintaining a consistent mood. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("She felt," "She understood") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though some metaphors strain for effect ("hushed blaze," "shards of hush"). The line-level craft supports the dreamlike tone effectively, despite occasional overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a house "resetting" itself to a benign original state—a reverse haunting—is a fresh and engaging concept. The specific integration of perfumery adds a unique, tangible layer to the magic.</comment>
