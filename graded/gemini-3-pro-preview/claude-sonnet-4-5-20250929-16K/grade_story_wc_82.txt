<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, and her internal landscape is vivid. However, the shift to summary ("Night after night") dilutes her struggle into a generalized process, distancing the reader from the specific, embodied cost of her choices in the middle section.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story relies on a montage ("Night after night," "Other residents... began to visit") to bridge the gap between the inciting incident and resolution. This breaks the single-scene tension required for this length, replacing dramatized causality with narrative summary, though the final closure image is conceptually strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and precise, with the "descending while ascending" optical illusion serving as a strong, grounding detail for the magical elements. The integration of the workshop within the floating tea garden creates a distinct, tactile sense of place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Escalation is linear and handled primarily through summary; there is no distinct on-page obstacle or reversal that forces a difficult tactical shift. The arrival of the community diffuses tension rather than sharpening the specific pressure on Mira to confront her own grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly articulates its thesis ("Grief took you down into darkness even as life insisted you rise"), explaining the metaphor to the reader rather than letting the subtext do the work. This diagnostic thematic summary flattens the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, though it occasionally slips into abstract labeling of emotion ("luminous torment") rather than purely embodied experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("crystalline spires," "blazed like a captive star"). However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Mira understood finally") and the slight "purple" quality of the prompt phrases hold it back from higher density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, gem-polishing, and dream-recording creates a fresh, specific magic system for processing grief. While the "grief as craft" trope is familiar, the specific execution and the optical illusion of the basilica add genuine novelty.</comment>
