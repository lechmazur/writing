<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Meridian is a compelling focalizer whose internal landscape perfectly mirrors the setting. Her realization of past error ("inadvertently stubborn") drives a genuine pivot in tactics, creating a strong agency arc. The emotional weight of her "decades" of failure provides sufficient grounding for the swift resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and the Resonant Reconfiguration (library as tomb) lands with conceptual weight. The climax—entering the impossible room—resolves tension somewhat rapidly, feeling more like a realization than a struggle, but the structural integrity remains high.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but the mechanism of resolution; the "impossible spaces" constrain and enable the final choice. The integration of the underwater library's geometry with the undertaker's task creates a vivid, indispensable environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation (intensifying signals) works well to force the decision. The protagonist's agency drives the outcome, though the obstacle of the "maddening" geometry dissolves a bit too easily into understanding, slightly softening the felt cost at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The thematic pivot—redefining peace from a destination to an "architecture"—is profound and organically earned. The story resists simple moralizing, instead offering a specific, resonant insight into the nature of rest and belonging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, managing the magical realism elements with authority. The tone modulates effectively from weary melancholy to a crystallized, sacred quiet at the close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("tired ghost," "desperate morse") without dragging. The imagery of light and geometry carries the narrative argument efficiently, free of scaffold or repetitive artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of an underwater undertaker, non-Euclidean library science, and lighthouse optics is fresh and striking. The story transforms potential tropes into a specific, memorable vision.</comment>
