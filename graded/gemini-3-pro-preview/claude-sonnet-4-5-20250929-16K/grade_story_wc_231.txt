<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Margit is a grounded, distinct protagonist with a clear worldview ("observing gaps") that colors her narration. Her motivation to decode the gesture is strong and personal, though her role in the resolution becomes somewhat passive as she receives the answers directly from the flower’s memory-dump rather than earning them through active deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on an expository flashback to resolve the central mystery. The flower functions as a device that delivers a comprehensive explanation (backstory, technology, motive) in a single block, which undercuts the causal tension of the investigation. The closure is clean, but the path to it feels expedited by this convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is established with sensory precision ("gleamed wetly," "nautical twilight") and serves as a strong atmospheric anchor. The physical environment of the dock and the mist effectively mirrors the liminal state of the protagonist’s mind and the themes of the story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The internal stakes (burden of memory) are established well, but the external conflict is resolved too smoothly via the memory projection. The escalation is quiet and internal; while fitting for the tone, the lack of a harder obstacle or price paid before the final realization limits the dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of letting go is resonant, but the story explicates it too directly in the final paragraphs ("Not suicide exactly, but a man choosing..."). By explicitly decoding the subtext for the reader, the story robs the final gesture of some of its potential power and ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, fitting the solitude of the character. However, there is a noticeable register slip in the middle section, where the voice shifts from meditative observation to dry, technical reportage ("developed a neural interface technology") to explain the plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is strong in the opening and closing, with evocative imagery. However, the middle section suffers from dense expository summary ("silicate compounds perfect for data storage") that disrupts the established rhythm and tone. The "tell" ratio spikes significantly here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of Nordic noir atmosphere with sci-fi memory elements is interesting, but the execution relies on familiar tropes (the object that explains the death). The "Edelweiss as data drive" concept is inventive but functions mechanically as a plot patch.</comment>
