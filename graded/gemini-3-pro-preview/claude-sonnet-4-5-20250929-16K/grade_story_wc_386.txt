<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya functions as a competent investigator, but her internal life is static; the central realization is an intuitive leap rather than a choice forged in pressure, leaving her devoid of conflicting impulses or personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear, but the central deduction—linking a snow globe dream to specific climate data—lacks causal grounding on the page, relying on psychic convenience; the closure is a declared intent without an immediate, paid cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vivid, anchoring the scene with specific textures like "ancient ice" and "dried glycerin," though the setting serves more as an atmospheric backdrop than a physical constraint on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the investigation proceeds linearly without active opposition or time constraints, and the climax is a quiet realization rather than a high-stakes confrontation or trade-off that forces a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The climate change motif braids well with the ice imagery, but the ending pivots to explicit moralizing ("truth doesn't have to stay buried"), flattening the subtext into a message rather than earning resonance through the image alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and atmospheric ("borrowed starlight"), though it occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction; the narrative distance is controlled, suiting the meditative tone of the investigation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong sensory details, but the dialogue functions as expository monologue addressed to an empty room, and occasional filter verbs ("Maya felt") distance the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of a wreck-diver medium interpreting dreams for climate justice is inventive, but the narrative execution follows a standard procedural path without formal risk-taking or deep emotional ambiguity.</comment>
