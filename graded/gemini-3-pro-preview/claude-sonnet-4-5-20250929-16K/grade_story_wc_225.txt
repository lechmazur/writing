<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle is resolved through diagnostic label-speak ("I was brilliant and cruel") rather than dramatized choice. The climax relies on a sudden, articulated epiphany that feels like therapy-speak rather than an earned psychological shift under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The structure follows a linear "instruction manual" pattern: the tapestry explicitly provides the directions, and the protagonist obeys them to achieve the resolution. While the closure (unfreezing) is legible, the lack of causal complications or failed attempts makes the trajectory predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The frozen village is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("dust motes hung motionless," "ivy hung suspended"). The atmosphere effectively grounds the magical premise, though the "statues of regret" metaphor leans slightly into telling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conflict is internal but low-resistance; the antagonist is a static puzzle that yields immediately to the protagonist's specific skill set. The escalation is absent because the tapestry provides the solution before the protagonist is forced to confront her limits or pay a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in both dialogue and narration ("mistakes made honestly could be forgiven"). The story explains its lesson to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone. The shift from observation to introspection is handled smoothly, though the POV occasionally filters experience ("She understood," "She found").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished but reliant on clichés and heavy similes ("sound like a whispered secret," "sound like wind through wheat"). The repetition of "fidgeting productively" acts as a noticeable text artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise of a frozen village healed by self-forgiveness is a familiar fantasy trope. While the chess/weaving synthesis offers a specific texture, the resolution follows a standard path without a fresh conceptual turn.</comment>
