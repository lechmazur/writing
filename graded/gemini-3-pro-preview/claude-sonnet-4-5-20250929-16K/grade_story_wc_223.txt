<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling, specific focalizer; the shift from crisis actor to crisis historian offers deep, ironic interiority. The trait "benevolently ruthless" is excellent, manifesting in difficult choices with the survivors that prove her commitment. The only slight drag is the colleague, whose arrival feels somewhat functional—a device to prompt her final articulation of self rather than a fully fleshed antagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is distinct and accumulative, moving effectively from chaotic survival to the crystallization of a new purpose. The middle section relies on summary ("She developed her method over weeks") which slightly flattens the pressure, but the final scene with the colleague provides the necessary scenic anchor for closure. The ending is a strong Conceptual Repricing of her life's work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the story physically cannot happen without the acoustic properties of the whispering gallery. The dome and the floor are not just backdrop but tools that Mara uses to achieve her goal. The sensory details ("real smoke," "vibrations that lingered") are precise and grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The internal conflict (memory vs. oblivion) is powerful and drives the narrative method. The external conflict serves largely as a frame, until the colleague challenges her definition of performance. While the confrontation is brief, it effectively forces Mara to explicitly reject her old identity and embrace the cost of the new one.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving "small gestures" against grand historical narratives is resonant and well-executed. The distinction between the chessboard royalty and the missing pawns is a strong, if slightly overt, metaphor. The final dialogue borders on a thesis statement ("When someone finally takes power..."), which risks stating the subtext too plainly, but the final image lands with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, carrying a melancholic but precise tone that fits a historian of trauma. The distinction between Mara's internal observations and her spoken instructions to survivors works well. The "historian" persona filters the world convincingly, noticing patterns and acoustics over standard survival concerns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-quality with strong rhythmic control ("electricity through water," "dissolve like salt"). There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Mara realized," "She understood it immediately") where showing the deduction might have been sharper. The definition inserted into the first "nomadic penumbra" usage flows a bit heavily, but the second usage circles back nicely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise is exceptionally fresh: a "historian of walking" using the acoustics of a ruined parliament to archive the behavior of the lost "pawns." Combining this with the "crisis actor" backstory creates a unique, ironic layering of performance versus reality that feels entirely original.</comment>
