<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marta's nerve regeneration offers a compelling somatic parallel to the hotel's silenced history, grounding her internal state effectively. However, the explicitly stated motivation ("to understand the cost of safety") reads more like a thematic thesis than a character-driven impulse, creating a slight distance in the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative arc is well-paced, building from the discovery of the bolt to the final act of singing. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the refusal to leave and the act of creating sound recontextualize the setting's oppression. The "ash marks" on a staircase surviving foot traffic rely on a "preserved somehow" hand-wave that slightly strains physical credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the "cobalt fortress" and its oppressive silence are not just backdrop but active antagonists pressuring the protagonist. The "nerve regeneration" functions as a micro-setting, constraining her ability to grasp the bolt and charging the final image with somatic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central conflict—silence versus remembrance—is clearly staged and escalates through specific micro-choices, such as humming in the corridors despite management's warnings. The pressure is coherent, and the stakes rise from personal sensation to a broader act of defiance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but heavily over-articulated; the narrative voice explicitly diagnoses the "cost of safety" and the nature of the silence, leaving little room for subtext. The final paragraph veers into moralizing ("The cost of safety would be paid... but not with erasure") rather than letting the image of the bolt and the song speak for themselves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the fortress. The perspective stays tightly anchored in Marta’s sensory experience, particularly her damaged hands, which enriches the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and evocative imagery ("prayer frozen mid-ascent"). Minor deductions for occasional "writerly" phrasing ("seraphically mundane") that calls attention to itself, but the line-level control is otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the nerve-damage recovery arc with the ghost-story trope creates a fresh, specific narrative. While the "ghosts of the past" element is familiar, the specific tactile focus on the bolt and the ash notes elevates the premise.</comment>
