<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marcus functions as a passive vessel for the plot; he accepts the supernatural immediately without internal conflict or doubt. He faces no difficult choices or personal costs, making the interaction transactional rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on convenience, as the ghost simply points to the solution, rendering the protagonist's detective skills largely irrelevant. The closure is tidy but unearned, lacking the "felt cost" required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is established with competent sensory details like rust and popcorn, though they lean on familiar tropes. The spatial relationship between the office, the shaft, and the crawlspace is functional but could be more tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stakes and pressure are minimal; there is no antagonist, active opposition, or meaningful risk to the protagonist. The resolution comes without struggle or escalation, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Some repairs... had nothing to do with cables"). This summary flattens the subtext into a lesson rather than allowing the imagery to linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and clear, fitting the observant technician persona. However, it relies on expository telling ("His motivation had always been...") to establish character traits rather than revealing them through action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean but marred by clichés ("ghost of happier times," "bring the truth to light") and forced phrasing ("engaged with the ceiling") to accommodate prompt words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the protagonist's occupation offers a fresh lens, the core narrative—a ghost pointing a helper to hidden evidence to solve a cold case—is a standard trope executed without a significant twist.</comment>
