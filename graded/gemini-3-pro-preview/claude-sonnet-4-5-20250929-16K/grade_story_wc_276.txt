<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct, competent protagonist whose interiority ("drowning on dry land") grounds her mythic task in tangible grief. Her choice to voice "anti-sound" reveals character through specific, risky action rather than just exposition. The emotional stakes are palpable, though her "cool-headed" competence slightly dampens the sense of struggle during the capture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal arc is clean and linear: the celestial event provides the opportunity, the specific tool/method secures the prize, and the resolution follows logically. The orientation is immediate and effective. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the captured sound transforms the daughter's silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is a vivid, integrated setting that dictates the physics of the plot (harmonics, frequencies). Sensory details like "phosphorescent trails" and "crystalline terraces" are specific and purposeful. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices, satisfying the high-band requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high (daughter's recovery) and established early. Escalation occurs through the chaotic movement of the stars and the need to use a dangerous method (voicing silence). While the protagonist succeeds with relative efficiency, the physical cost (damaging the skiff with the spike, physical pain) is visible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into something bearable is tightly woven into the narrative mechanics (transliterating sound to matter). The "feral lullaby" concept adds complexity, acknowledging that the cure has "teeth." The final image of the singing daughter offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the mythic sci-fi tone. The third-person limited POV stays firmly with Mira, filtering the world through her maternal desperation and professional expertise. Transitions between observation and action are smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("words trapped... like birds in a frozen lake"). The rhythm matches the tension of the hunt. There is a slight reliance on exposition to explain the daughter's condition ("physicians called it..."), but the imagery generally carries the weight effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mechanics, acoustic physics, and fishing tropes creates a fresh, engaging premise. The execution feels original, blending emotional intimacy with a grand, abstract setting without losing clarity.</comment>
