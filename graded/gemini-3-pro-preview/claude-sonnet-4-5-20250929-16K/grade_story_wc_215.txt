<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas is a well-realized focalizer with a distinct worldview ("voices became weapons") that motivates his initial isolation. The shift from avoidance to engagement is earned through his specific interest in the apiary's history, and his acceptance of the "keeper" role provides a satisfying character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from discovery to observation to resolution with clear orientation throughout. While the puzzle solution (watching the ghost's walking pattern) is a somewhat standard trope, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas accepts the burden of memory—lands with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The apiary setting is rendered with specific, sensory details ("honey darker than midnight," "melted wax") that ground the supernatural elements. The contrast between the "scorched" wasteland outside and the preserved interior effectively mirrors Silas's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes remain largely quiet and thematic; the conflict is an intellectual puzzle rather than a high-pressure crisis. While the internal shift is meaningful, the external obstacles (opening a box) lack visceral urgency or rising danger, keeping the tension at a simmer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of bearing witness—valuing the specific human lives behind labor—is beautifully integrated and paid off by the contents of the list. The ending resonates without becoming preachy, offering a non-literal answer to the problem of ghosts in a broken world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately contemplative, matching Silas's isolation. The transition from wariness to understanding is handled without head-hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density ("seals Silas reinforced weekly with melted wax and silence"). A few phrases lean slightly toward workshop-standard imagery ("world cracked open," "scorched breath"), but the line-level craft is generally strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of ghosts as remnants of labor needing acknowledgment is a fresh take on the post-apocalyptic haunt trope. The apiary setting distinguishes the story, though the "puzzle box" mechanic itself is familiar territory.</comment>
