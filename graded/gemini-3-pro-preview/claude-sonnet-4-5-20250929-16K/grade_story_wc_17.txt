<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mara serves primarily as a vessel for the prompt's concept rather than a fully realized agent. Her motivation is stated explicitly via exposition ("Mara knew something they didn't") rather than dramatized through struggle, and her "sensitively perceptive" trait feels inserted as a label rather than demonstrated through unique action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The plot relies heavily on the "convenient diary" trope, where the protagonist finds a text that explicitly explains the backstory and central mystery without effort. This reduces the narrative arc to a passive scavenger hunt. The closure works as a conceptual realization, but the path to it lacks causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of "corridor echo cartography" creates a distinct and engaging atmosphere, supported by the auditory details of the setting. The "ivy-veiled passage" is visualized well, though the "climate shifts" element feels like background wallpaper rather than an active pressure on the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle opposing Mara's goal. She enters, observes, finds evidence, and understands, with the environment welcoming rather than resisting her. The "burden" is accepted without a moment of doubt or a visible price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of architectural consciousness is clear but delivered didactically through Eleanor's diary and Mara's internal monologue. The story explains its thesis ("Architecture consciousness wasn't about...") rather than letting it emerge organically from the action. The final image of the sighing corridor resonates well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is functional and atmospheric but slips into exposition too often. The integration of required phrases (e.g., "sensitively perceptive") disrupts the narrative distance, feeling like authorial insertions rather than character voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose flow is severely hampered by the clumsy insertion of prompt strings. Specifically, the redundancy of "The fireplace... stopped her. Half-burned diaries spilled..." followed immediately by "Through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace..." creates a jarring paraphrase loop. The repetition of "sensitively perceptive" also degrades the texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of recording building echoes is imaginative and offers a fresh angle on the haunted house genre. However, the execution relies on the tired device of a found journal explaining the plot, which undermines the ingenuity of the setup.</comment>
