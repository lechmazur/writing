<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The character's internal struggle is clear, and the physical grounding during the climax is effective. However, the interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("somatic markers," "the body keeps score") to define her state, which creates a clinical distance rather than a purely embodied experience of trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The structure is solid, effectively utilizing a single scene to dramatize a cycle of trigger and recovery. The closure—an Earned Stasis where Layla regains composure—lands clearly, though the backstory and explanatory blocks in the first half slow the initial momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is well-integrated; the glass wall and the specific plants (lavender, rosemary) function as active tools for the protagonist's grounding technique. The "automated light" provides a strong atmospheric bracket that enhances the theme of isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conflict is internal but legible: the struggle to maintain presence against a PTSD trigger. The escalation (helicopter) is immediate and forces a decisive reaction, though the stakes remain relatively low-key and the resolution feels somewhat expected.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding a "pearl of stillness" amidst trauma is coherent and resonant. The execution leans slightly didactic, particularly with the explicit statement about anchoring "optimism in realism," but the final image successfully grounds the concept in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and intimate, effectively tracking Layla's shifting focus. The voice occasionally slips into therapeutic exposition ("Her therapist had explained it"), which dilutes the unique perceptual signature of the character in favor of generalized explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sensory details like the "crumpled photograph" and "salt wind." A few abstract phrases ("anchor optimism in realism") reduce the density, but the line-level craft generally supports the contemplative tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative of a survivor finding solace in a garden is a familiar trope, executed here with competence but little structural or conceptual risk. While the "pearl of stillness" adds specific texture, the overall arc follows a standard path for trauma recovery stories.</comment>
