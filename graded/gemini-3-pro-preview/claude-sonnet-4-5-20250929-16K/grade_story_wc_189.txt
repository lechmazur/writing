<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is consistent and the shift in her understanding is grounded in her established worldview. The characterization leans slightly on told traits ("warmly observant quality") rather than purely dramatized behavior in the opening beats, but the emotional logic holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is structurally sound, effectively utilizing a textural lens to move from resistance to acceptance. Closure is achieved through a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist reframes the central conflict using the story's core metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the tidal pools provide the specific vocabulary through which the protagonist processes the conflict. The environment actively constrains and guides the resolution, charging the final image with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and legible, focusing on a relational transition. While the pressure is gentle, the emotional cost—accepting the necessity of departure—is felt on the page, though the conflict resolution feels slightly smooth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of liminality is coherent but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("humans live in transitions too"), bordering on a thematic echo. The resonance is slightly dampened by the characters explaining the story's meaning to one another.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, fitting the contemplative mood. Dialogue occasionally stiffens into thematic exposition, but the perceptual signature remains distinct and grounded in the protagonist’s chronicler persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong, character-specific imagery ("interior weather," "skittish octopus"). Rhythm and syntax support the reflective pacing without dragging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements competently, though the "tide pool as life metaphor" is a familiar literary trope. The specific inclusion of the jade cicada adds a nice textural layer to an otherwise standard wise-elder/nature-lesson framework.</comment>
