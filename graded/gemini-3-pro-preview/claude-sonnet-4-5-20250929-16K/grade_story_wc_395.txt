<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira is a compelling protagonist whose transition from professional curiosity to high-stakes rescuer is grounded in a well-placed personal connection (the brother). Her interiority is rendered with specific, job-relevant details ("digital exhaust," "null-state"), and her agency drives every turn of the plot. The shift from observer to active agent is earned and carries visible emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story relies on narrative summary and montage ("37th day") to compress the investigation, which creates some distance before the scene focuses on the climax. However, the causal chain remains unbroken, and the closure acts as a clear Decisive Change where the protagonist abandons safety for a rescue mission. The pacing is efficient, though the middle section feels more like a synopsis than a dramatized scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The digital setting is realized with tactile, evocative imagery that transforms abstract data into a physical space ("neglected corners," "digital grave"). The atmosphere of melancholic decay is consistent and supports the theme of erasure. The contrast between the physical patch and the digital void anchors the setting effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a technical puzzle to a personal crisis involving a lost sibling and potential treason. The "lie" to the supervisor serves as a functional test of commitment, raising the immediate tension. The final choice to initiate extraction forecloses the path of safety, establishing a clear cost to the protagonist's career and freedom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus erasure is explored with nuance, avoiding simple binary conclusions about technology. The concept of "absence" acting as a signal ("Data didn't communicate. But absence could") resonates strongly with the plot mechanics. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question of where the forgotten go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical terminology with a lyrical, melancholic tone that fits the "memory keeper" persona. The distance is well-controlled, staying close to Mira’s perceptions and shifting appropriately with her realization. The pacing of the prose matches the emotional intensity of the discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, integrating required phrases like "echo of forgotten songs" seamlessly into the atmospheric description. Imagery is specific and dense ("edges frayed," "surgical precision"), and there are no distracting artifacts or loops. The writing supports the story's momentum without calling attention to itself.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the "digital afterlife/purgatory" trope is familiar in sci-fi, the specific angle of an archival archaeologist decoding erasure adds a fresh layer. The synthesis of the physical object (patch) with the digital mystery feels organic rather than forced. The execution elevates the core concept beyond a standard genre exercise.</comment>
