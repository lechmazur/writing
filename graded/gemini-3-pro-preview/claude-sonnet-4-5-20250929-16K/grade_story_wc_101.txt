<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, noble leader, but she lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. She functions primarily as a vehicle for the moral rather than a character making difficult trade-offs with visible costs. Her "flawless" leadership lowers the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary ("Week by week") rather than dramatized scene work. The resolution—where a single speech unifies a fracturing community instantly—feels unearned and tidy, lacking the friction required for a high-band score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "terra-cotta arbor" provides a distinct anchor, and the cold is palpable. However, the setting often drifts into abstraction ("clay and hope") rather than providing concrete, restrictive details that force character choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (community dispersal) dissolves too easily upon Mira's revelation. The conflict lacks a "felt cost" in the climax; the opposition (young Sasha) folds immediately, removing the tension necessary for a compelling resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit didactic statements ("We're stronger together") and a summarizing final paragraph that explains the lesson to the reader. This moralizing approach replaces organic resonance with instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and consistent, but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining emotions and motivations ("pride was sometimes easier to swallow") instead of allowing them to emerge through subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose relies on clichés ("whispered secrets," "heart hammered") and abstract pairings ("clay and hope"). While mechanically clean, the line-level craft lacks freshness and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story follows a predictable fable structure: a noble leader secretly helps, then reveals the secret to teach a lesson. It lacks a sharp, original angle or a subversive take on the prompt elements.</comment>
