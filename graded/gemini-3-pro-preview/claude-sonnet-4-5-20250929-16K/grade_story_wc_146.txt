<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetype, lacking internal contradiction or embodied emotion; she functions as a plot device to fix the external problem without facing a difficult choice or paying a personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrative is coherent but lacks a distinct turning point or "felt cost" at closure; the resolution is a return to the status quo achieved through competence, devoid of sacrifice or narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The setting relies on "ghost town" clichés (weeds, empty shops) but achieves functionality through the specific acoustic details of the tuning fork interacting with the stone architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Narrative pressure is minimal as the protagonist encounters no obstacles, setbacks, or time crunches; the "collapse" stakes are declared but never test the character's agency or force a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of restoration via rhythm is clear but executed didactically through exposition ("patterns created meaning"); the "happy ending" lacks the ambiguity or resonance required for higher thematic scores.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mythic, distant voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone, though it relies on summary to establish character traits ("cryptic by nature") rather than revealing them through interaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, effectively utilizing the auditory motif, though it relies on some filter verbs ("could hear") and stock phrasing ("drinking in the morning light") that soften the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The core concept of acoustic reality-tuning is imaginative, but the execution follows a safe, low-stakes "magical repair" template that lacks a fresh structural or emotional twist.</comment>
