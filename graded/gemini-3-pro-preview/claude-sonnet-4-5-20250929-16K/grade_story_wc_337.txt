<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is expertly mapped through somatic details ("trembling hands") that link her backstory failure to her current mastery. The choice to prioritize truth over peace demonstrates complex agency, and the accumulated "silence" serves as a palpable, character-specific cost that deepens with the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal lens; the revelation of the brother’s betrayal pivots the goal from release to confrontation seamlessly. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence—heavier and emptier—satisfying the requirement for a felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "salt-stiff" net functions as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains the action and grounds the magical elements in tactile reality. The interplay between the fractured starlight and the broken mask effectively mirrors the internal state of the protagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The escalation is driven by the shift from a physical puzzle (knots) to a moral one (the burden of the secret). While the resolution relies on an off-stage consequence (the brother on the cliff), the immediate pressure on Mara to inflict "truth" rather than peace creates sufficient on-page stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The distinction between "reaching him" and "peace" elevates the theme beyond a standard ghost-story redemption, embracing a messier, more mature reality. The final image of the unfinished mask reflecting starlight perfectly encapsulates the thematic resonance of mending without fixing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, melancholic control that suits the "lucid unrest" tone. A brief moment of expository summary ("She'd discovered she accumulated silence...") slightly distances the reader, but the focus quickly returns to the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with evocative phrasing like "nervous colors" and "held-breath moment." The only slight drag is the phrase "The irony wasn't lost on her," a familiar construction that feels less precise than the surrounding original imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a net catching drowned spirits and a restorer unpicking them is a genuinely fresh synthesis of maritime and restoration tropes. While the "ghost reveals a murder" beat is a classic genre staple, the mechanical execution gives it new life.</comment>
