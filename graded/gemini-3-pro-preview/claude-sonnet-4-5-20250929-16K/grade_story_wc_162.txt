<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is rich and specifically drawn, grounding the surreal setting in genuine emotional stakes regarding her family's collapse. The motivation to understand "thresholds" drives the narrative effectively, though the epiphany relies partly on inherited traits rather than purely active struggle. The emotional logic of "irreversibility" lands with weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, but the causal link between analyzing wood grain and decoding a pilot's logbook feels metaphorical rather than earned mechanics. The resolution relies heavily on a "found text" (the mother's note) that explicitly explains the backstory and theme, acting as a convenient key to the mystery rather than a dramatized discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" is a vivid, surreal container that effectively merges memory and geometry. Sensory details like "slow-breathing glass" and the tactile nature of the oak planks ground the abstract concepts in physical experience. The setting actively reflects the protagonist's internal dissolution at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stakes are conceptual but felt—the need to understand a childhood trauma versus the safety of the "fractured hush." The escalation moves cleanly from assembly to analysis to decision. The cost is the permanent loss of the reconstructed safe space (the terrace dissolving), satisfying the requirement for an irreversible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "necessary distances" is central, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the mother's log entry explicitly articulates the thesis ("Some thresholds, once crossed, remake the crosser"). This reduces subtextual resonance by stating the moral directly rather than letting it emerge solely from Maya’s action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, managing the surreal elements with confidence. The transition from memory to present action is smooth. The prompt phrase "featherly determined" is integrated grammatically but stands out slightly against the otherwise natural register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("grain swirled around a knot like water around a stone"). Sentence variety supports the pacing well. No significant scaffolding artifacts or repetitive phrasing were detected; the style suits the dream-like logic of the piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "corn maze trauma" with a surreal, shifting terrace is imaginative and fresh. While the "found diary explains everything" trope is familiar, the metaphysical framing of geometry and thresholds elevates the material beyond a standard family drama.</comment>
