<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira is a compelling focalizer whose inverted synesthesia functions not just as a quirk but as the engine of her agency and craft. Her internal landscape is rich and consistent, though the "patient mathematics" of her cancer serves more as atmospheric pressure than a source of active friction against her immediate goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative pivots elegantly on the redefinition of the central problem—from "collecting absence" to capturing "transformation"—which drives the climax with satisfying intellectual and emotional causality. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration that successfully merges the client’s needs with Mira’s own acceptance of mortality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, blending the industrial decay of "rusted ribs" with the surreal vitality of the "preserved crimson" apples in a way that actively charges the story's mood. The greenhouse functions as a crucible, compressing the pressure of the ocean and the aurora into the work itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated through the specific difficulty of the "trust breaking" sound, though the escalation is largely internal and artistic rather than external. The physical cost of the climax—imprinting her thumb into hot silver—effectively dramatizes the sacrifice required to solve the puzzle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis of cellular division (cancer) and relational fracture (trust) creates a powerful, non-didactic resonance in the final image. The insight that "breaking wasn't ending" feels earned through the labor depicted on the page rather than asserted by the author.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical authority that integrates the synesthetic elements ("blues keened," "sound sang crimson") without becoming disorienting. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, keeping the reader close to Mira’s perception while maintaining the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("webbed with calcium deposits," "kelp in current"), establishing a strong rhythm that supports the magical realism. A few descriptors lean toward the repetitive ("impossible garden," "impossible light"), but the overall line-level control is high quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central conceit—a submarine forge using synesthesia to craft acoustic prosthetics from abstract memories—is highly original and executed with conviction. The blending of biological decay and metallurgical craft creates a unique aesthetic signature.</comment>
