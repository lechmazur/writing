<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, but the internal pivot ("Mira had come to understand") relies on summary rather than dramatized struggle. The emotional experience is often filtered through diagnostic labels ("human longing," "fear," "hope") rather than embodied sensation, creating distance during the critical realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from mapping to broadcasting. Closure lands clearly as a Conceptual Repricing of her role. Orientation is established well, though the progression feels linear and lacks a moment of significant causal friction or doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "green-black water" and bioluminescence are vivid and ground the scene. The "emotional heat-map" concept occasionally abstracts the setting into data points, but the physical environment of the cave remains tangible and supports the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily conceptual; while the shift in purpose is intelligible, the pressure driving it is low. The discovery of the "anomaly" is a convenient catalyst that meets little resistance, resulting in a shift that feels inevitable rather than hard-won against opposition or limitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("creating an atlas of the human heart," "The unknown would not remain voiceless") rather than subtext. The narrative interprets the meaning for the reader, reducing the resonant aftereffect of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative distance suitable for the protagonist's isolation. However, the mediation of experience through technical-mystical jargon ("measurable wavelengths") sometimes creates a barrier to immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally smooth but marred by the clumsy repetition of the phrase "factually mystical" and some expository scaffolding ("ninety percent of humanity"). The rhythm is steady but lacks variation in intensity during the discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The "quiet apocalypse" mapper is a familiar trope, executed here with competence but little risk. The specific combination of emotional mapping and bioluminescent caves adds flavor, though the resolution follows a standard trajectory for this genre.</comment>
