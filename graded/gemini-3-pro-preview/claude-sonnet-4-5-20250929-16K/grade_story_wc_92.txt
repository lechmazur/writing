<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira is competent and consistent, aligning with her "calmly inventive" trait, but she lacks internal friction or vulnerability. Her superiority over the antagonist ("his imagination never stretched") reduces the sense of risk, making her success feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, moving from the blackout to the retrieval of intelligence and the successful evasion of the guard. The ending achieves a valid "Charged Poise," effectively setting the stage for future conflict, though the immediate resolution feels somewhat convenient given the ease of bypassing the guard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tactile details of the sundial in darkness are excellent, grounding the scene in a specific sensory experience that aids the plot. However, the macro-setting description ("crystalline walls," "luminous stones") leans toward generic fantasy tropes compared to the specificity of the coded angles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are stated (prisoners, revolution) but the on-page pressure is low because the antagonist, Captain Voss, is dismissed as incompetent. The climax relies on his lack of imagination rather than Mira's tactical ingenuity under genuine duress, mitigating the sense of danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inversion of light and darkness—where truth moves in the dark and the "light" of the fort is a lie—is a cohesive thematic thread. The "cradle of sparks" metaphor integrates well with the sundial mechanics, though the revolutionary sentiment feels slightly standard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining Mira's observant and measured voice throughout. The narrative distance is appropriate for a character who suppresses emotion for survival, though it keeps the reader at arm's length.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and readable with good rhythm ("darkness swallowed everything"). Some phrasing leans toward stock imagery ("holding them like a promise," "iron grip"), but the technical execution is clean with no major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core mechanism of using a half-finished sundial's angles for tactile coding is a fresh, specific invention. However, the surrounding elements—the oblivious guard captain, the scheduled blackout, the silent revolution—are familiar genre staples that lower the overall ingenuity.</comment>
