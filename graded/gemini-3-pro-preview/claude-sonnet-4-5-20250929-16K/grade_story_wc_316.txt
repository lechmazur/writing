<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kenji’s internal arc from numbness to connection is legible and central, driven by the specific catalyst of the "duplicate" brain. However, the climax relies heavily on reported emotion ("felt his voice shake," "sensation was overwhelming") rather than fully embodied experience, which creates a slight distance in the pivotal moment. The shift from detachment to brotherhood is earned conceptually but happens rapidly for the depth of the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong: Yoon’s intervention in the dojo directly reframes Kenji’s perspective, leading to the decisive action in court. Closure is distinct and meaningful (Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change), resolving the legal plot through a character-driven choice. Orientation is immediate and grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the "borrowed physics" and the landscape rewriting itself ("Forests became prairies") effectively mirror the protagonist's fluid identity. The "brain in amber fluid" is a vivid, grounding prop that anchors the abstract conversation in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are high (identity and legal personhood), and the pressure of the impending hearing drives the scene. The resolution—withdrawing the opposition—is a valid character choice, though the lack of resistance or interaction from the clone makes the external conflict feel slightly low-friction in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "complementary opposites" integrates well with the ego death premise and the setting's instability. While Yoon’s dialogue borders on didactic ("Now you're understanding"), the final image of brotherhood successfully vivifies the concept without needing a summary moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, balancing the detached tone of the protagonist with the surreal environment. The shift to a more emotional register in the courtroom is handled well, though the use of "vivify" twice (once in dialogue, once in narration) feels slightly repetitive rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and dense ("cables that hummed with borrowed physics"), but the climax suffers from filter verb clustering ("felt his voice," "saw tears," "felt answering moisture") that dulls immediacy. The simile "like a blade through silk" is a cliché that detracts from the otherwise fresh imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept—a custody battle between a post-ego-death original and his pre-therapy clone—is highly inventive and sophisticated. The resolution avoids the standard "evil clone" or "tragic sacrifice" tropes in favor of a fresh, constructive synthesis.</comment>
