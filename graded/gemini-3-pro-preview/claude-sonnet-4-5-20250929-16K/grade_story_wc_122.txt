<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mira's characterization relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Her motivation (defeating numbness) is stated rather than shown through a specific moment of acute struggle or failure, and her success feels inevitable rather than earned by navigating contradictory impulses in a scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story operates as a narrative summary or synopsis spanning months ("For months," "spent weeks," "By the time winter") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate causality. This violates the scope default and prevents the reader from experiencing the turning point in real-time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric details are strong, particularly the tactile descriptions of vibration and the "mirrored hush" of the cavern. The sensory work successfully grounds the reader in Mira's deaf experience, though the lack of a specific temporal anchor limits the setting's immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>There is little to no escalation or active resistance; Mira attempts a solution found in journals, and it works immediately on the first try without complication or cost. The conflict is resolved linearly, lacking the push-pull of genuine dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing ("reminder that sometimes things must break apart to reveal what exists in the fracture") rather than emerging organically from action. The subtext is made text, reducing its resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrically attuned to the subject matter, but the high psychic distance contributes to the fable-like, summary feel. The POV is stable but tells more than it shows.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good attention to sensory density. The required phrases are integrated relatively smoothly, though "audibly muted" reads slightly clunky. Line-level craft is the story's strongest asset.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of "backward music" revealing hidden harmonies for a deaf protagonist is an imaginative and fresh angle on the "music as vibration" trope. However, the execution follows a fairly standard healing-narrative template.</comment>
