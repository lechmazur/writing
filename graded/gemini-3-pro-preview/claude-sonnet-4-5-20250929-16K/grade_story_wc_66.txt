<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s dedication is consistent and her agency drives the encoding process, but she lacks internal contradiction or conflicting impulses; she operates as a steadfast vessel for the theme rather than a character torn by difficult choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative structure works well, building the "weight" of stories until they manifest physically; closure lands with a resonant image, though the patrol beat is a standard obstacle that resolves without complicating the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is excellent, anchoring the fable-like tone in specific sensory details; the "secretly luminous" dust and the amber radio glow create a vivid, claustrophobic yet magical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the central test (the patrol) is passed too easily via a simple hiding action; the lack of a forced trade-off or lasting cost limits the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central metaphor of musical encryption is intellectually satisfying, but the final paragraph explicitly articulates the thesis ("stories persist..."), flattening the subtext into a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical voice maintains the specific "thistled calm" tone throughout; POV control is precise, filtering the world consistently through Maren’s focused, defiant perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density; occasional slightly overwrought phrasing ("irony pleased her with its thistled calm") fits the style but draws attention to itself.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mechanic of encoding forbidden stories into sheet music is inventive and specific, though the "story famine" and "cultural patrol" elements rely on familiar, generic dystopian tropes.</comment>
