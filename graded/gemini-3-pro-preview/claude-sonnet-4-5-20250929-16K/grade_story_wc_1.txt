<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The character's reframing of her trauma—realizing she was merely "geography" and "infrastructure" rather than a personal target—is a sophisticated, non-obvious psychological beat. This shift from searching for providential meaning to accepting cold utility creates deep, specific interiority that earns the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change (returning to testify) anchored by a concrete on-page discovery. The causal bridge between observing the frost's retreat and decoding the ledger's gaps is poetic yet structurally rigorous, allowing the drive lens to hold perfectly through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric; the frost and canyon floor function as active tools that constrain and guide the protagonist's intellectual breakthrough. The sensory details ("stone still warm," "silver shadows") are precise and purposeful, directly serving the glass artist's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates cleanly from an abstract search for peace to a concrete realization of criminal intent. The stakes heighten effectively from personal healing to legal justice, and the cost—losing the illusion of special providence for the hard truth of being "infrastructure"—is palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The integration of glass, frost, and negative space coheres beautifully into a meditation on survival. The score is capped slightly below 9.0 because the thematic thesis ("Meaning didn't arrive like revelation; it accumulated like condensation") is explicitly stated in the narrative rather than left entirely to resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, controlled lyricism that matches the protagonist's artistic discipline. The transition from meditative observation to analytical deduction is handled without breaking the established rhythm or distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high and imagery is evocative. However, the verbatim repetition of the distinct phrase "steadily adaptive" (once for "will," once for "hands") reads as a noticeable echo/artifact that momentarily disrupts the polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of forensic accounting with artistic intuition via the frost metaphor is fresh. The subversion of the "tortured artist" trope—where the attack is revealed to be impersonally logistical rather than a strike against her vision—adds significant ingenuity.</comment>
