<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara is a coherent protagonist with clear agency in the final decision. However, her motivation ("to spin stories into shared meaning") feels expository and slightly meta rather than fully embodied in the scene's action. The connection to the grandfather provides context but feels functionally inserted to justify the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "trail of photographs" resting on a mudbank after a forty-foot water drop defies physics; paper would scatter or dissolve, making the setup feel contrived. The transition to the "Within a week" summary resolves the conflict with the supervisor too neatly, bypassing the immediate tension of the insubordination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with details like "skeletal structures" and "defiant purple threads" establishing a strong mood. The physical reality of the drought-exposed town is well-rendered, though the "mirrored hush" phrase is repeated, diminishing its impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The conflict with the supervisor provides a clear inciting incident and pressure. However, the cost of Mara's defiance is muted by the rapid jump to a successful resolution where the community validates her choice, removing the risk of the threatened "expunging."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story relies on a "moralizing ending" where the theme is explicitly explained to the reader ("She understood now that..."). This violates the show-don't-tell principle for theme and reduces resonance by summarizing the meaning instead of letting the final image speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and generally polished. The use of the required phrase "precisely humane" feels slightly unidiomatic and forced, particularly in the second instance regarding Mara's vigilance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent, but the repetition of prompt phrases ("mirrored hush," "precisely humane") draws attention to the artifice. The final paragraph becomes abstract and dense with summary rather than concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a drowned town resurfacing is a familiar trope handled with competence but little subversion. The resolution—a community gathering that heals the wound—feels safe and conventional, lacking a surprising or complicating edge.</comment>
