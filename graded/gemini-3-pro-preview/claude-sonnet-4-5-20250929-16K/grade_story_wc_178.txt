<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is anchored well by the specific, embodied detail of counting candle stubs, which effectively dramatizes her frugality and the stakes of resource scarcity. Her internal motivation is clear, though at times conveyed through expository summary ("Her motivation had always been singular") rather than purely through action. The emotional resonance of her isolation is palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from investigation to discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the closure. The pivot—realizing the map's origin is light-years away—is a strong structural beat that recontextualizes the premise effectively. The ending lands with a legible sense of endurance and secret preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active; the "reclaimed stone" and "lattice windows" aren't just scenery but constraints that shape the lighting and the atmosphere of the work. The sensory details of the "violet hour" and the cooling floor ground the abstract mathematical work in a tangible physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central conflict is intellectual and internal, escalating through the decoding process rather than external opposition. While the political threat provides background tension, the on-page pressure is somewhat low-stakes until the realization hits. The "cost" is largely conceptual—the burden of secret knowledge—rather than a visceral price paid in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme is potent but over-articulated. The story explicitly explains its thesis in the final third ("proof that devotion to understanding transcended time," "observation and devotion were the same act"), which flattens the subtext into a sermon. This reliance on telling the reader what the covenant means, rather than letting the image of the star-map speak for itself, limits the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a "dusky," meditative tone that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to Mara’s perception. The rhythm is generally good, though it occasionally dips into slightly heavy-handed poeticisms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from some repetitive phrasing (using "uncloaking" and "uncloaked" for the two major realizations). Some descriptors feel like "telling" disguised as description ("empirically ironic," "suffused with dusky harmony"), which distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept—Babylonian astronomers encoding a perspective from a star 17 light-years away—is a brilliant, fresh synthesis of archaeology and sci-fi. It transforms the "scholar in the ruins" trope into something specific and memorable.</comment>
