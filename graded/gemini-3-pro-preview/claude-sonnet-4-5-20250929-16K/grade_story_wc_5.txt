<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct and drives the ritualistic procedure with palpable emotional weight. Interiority is embodied well through the trembling hands and the "patience made physical," though the specific scientific realization about the neutron star feels slightly more diagnostic than earned by the character's immediate emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain of the ritual is tight, and the closure—a Decisive Change via the burning map—lands with clear cost (impermanence requiring memorization). The "neutron star" identification relies on a slight knowledge leap that feels convenient, but the internal logic of the magic system holds the structure together firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as tool; the orchard's debris isn't just scenery but becomes the literal medium of the map, actively constraining the protagonist's method. The "frozen world" condition is essential to the plot's mechanics, charging the final image of release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (connection vs. loss) and escalate from local grief to cosmic entanglement. The pressure is largely internal and environmental (the "held breath"), which works well, though the lack of active opposition limits the dynamic range slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of grief as transformation is resonant and organic to the alchemy mechanic. The text occasionally explicitly states the theme ("constellation of sorrow and love") rather than letting the image speak for itself, which slightly softens the subtextual impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, matching the protagonist's disciplined grief. The perspective remains tightly anchored, filtering the cosmic elements through a specific, learned lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and atmospheric, but marred by a few scaffolds ("not metaphorically, but literally") and repetitive abstract phrasing regarding her patience ("patience made physical," "embodied patience"). These slight drags on momentum prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A highly inventive synthesis of fantasy alchemy and astrophysical concepts (photons, pulsars). The use of flash paper as a medium for impermanent mapping is a fresh, specific detail that elevates the "grief map" trope.</comment>
