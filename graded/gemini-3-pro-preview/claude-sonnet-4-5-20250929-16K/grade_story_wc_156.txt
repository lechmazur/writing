<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marta’s internal conflict between preservation and curiosity is compelling, and her professional traits clearly shape her interaction with the anomaly. The pivot from fear to "strange liberation" relies on diagnostic telling rather than embodied reaction, slightly muting the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The recursive loop structure is executed with precision, teaching the reader the dream logic early so the ending lands as a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration. The ambiguity of "waking" is handled with causal rigor within the story's rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is an exceptional active setting that constrains action and drives the plot through acoustic mechanics. The sensory details—fountains whispering, peeling paint—are vivid and functionally integrated into the central mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is distinct and pressure builds effectively as the "waking" cycles intensify. The cost is felt tangibly through the thinning of memories, grounding the metaphysical stakes in a specific personal loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of certainty versus curiosity emerges organically from the protagonist's profession and the plot's mechanics. The ending resonates by recontextualizing the restoration work as a form of nested dreaming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, matching the surreal atmosphere without slipping into confusion. The recursive nature of the POV is managed without head-hopping, maintaining a stable anchor amidst the shifting reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong imagery ("weight like an anchor—or like wings"). A brief expository block explaining Marta's "methodically playful" nature interrupts the momentum slightly, telling what could have been shown purely through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of art restoration, acoustics, and nested realities is fresh and highly inventive. The use of the hobo nickel as a specific, tactile key to the surrealism adds a unique grounded element to the dream logic.</comment>
