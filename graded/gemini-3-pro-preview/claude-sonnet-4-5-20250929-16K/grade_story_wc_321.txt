<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is clearly motivated and competent, but he lacks internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His "resilient positivity" functions as a superpower that facilitates a smooth victory rather than a trait that costs him something or forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where the radio acts as a magical fix, restoring the world without a visible cost or sacrifice. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction—everyone is saved, the world is fixed—which undercuts the weight of the crisis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "bioluminescence" mapping routes and "sideways clocks" create a strong, specific sense of place. The environment effectively grounds the surreal premise, though the setting exerts little physical pressure on the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative lacks escalation; Marcus identifies a solution and executes it without facing new complications, setbacks, or opposing wills. The climax is linear and low-friction, missing the tightening of options or rising stakes required for higher tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("The empty glass had shown him the truth..."), reducing resonance to a moral statement. The story resolves into a tidy lesson rather than lingering on the complexity of loss or dispersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controls the surreal tone well, blending the nautical with the metaphysical. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Marcus, though the emotional range is somewhat static.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is competent and clear, though it relies on filter verbs ("he'd realized," "noticed") and summary during key moments. The climax lists the appearing passengers ("Mrs. Chen... Mr. Okafor...") rather than dramatizing the struggle of retrieval.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of a ferryman knitting timelines together is engaging, but the execution leans on familiar tropes of "calling names to restore reality." The lack of a unique twist or heavy cost makes the resolution feel safe rather than ingenious.</comment>
