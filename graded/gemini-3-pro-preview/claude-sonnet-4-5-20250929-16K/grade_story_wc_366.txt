<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority relies heavily on abstract labeling ("Safety. Pure and absolute") rather than embodied emotion or specific memory. The choreography with the sea glass—placing it as the peak of a monument and then immediately pocketing it—creates a confusing contradiction in her physical agency and intent. Her connection to the "mother's arms" feels inserted as a summary explanation rather than arising organically from the scene's pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative momentum stalls significantly after the inciting incident (lamp out) for a large block of backstory that explains the stone ritual. There is a logic gap in the premise: a professional supply skipper ignores a failed automated light to perform a ritual, and the external crisis is resolved by sunrise rather than action. The closure lands on a decision, but the physical logic supporting it (the glass transfer) is muddy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The setting details, particularly the scratched messages on the glass and the Fresnel lens, effectively ground the scene in the specific atmosphere of the lighthouse. However, descriptors like "blue as forgetting" drift into purple prose that distances the reader from the physical reality. The atmosphere is consistent but relies occasionally on poetic abstraction over sensory grit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, with the external pressure (the broken light) sidelined for the epistolary relationship. The escalation is gentle, moving from the lamp failure to the final letter, but lacks a sharp moment of risk or trade-off; the "cost" is purely emotional and stated rather than felt through a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story explicitly explains its theme in the final paragraphs ("She understood now... They weren't haunting; they were protecting"), leaving little room for subtext or reader interpretation. The realization is delivered as a summary sermon rather than emerging inevitably from the drama of the scene. This over-articulation flattens the emotional resonance of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reflective, fitting the "Silent Skipper" persona. However, it tends toward sentimental abstraction ("luminous conversation," "embrace her like gratitude") that tells the reader how to feel. The tone is cohesive but lacks the rhythmic variety to heighten the tension of the lamp failing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from telling over showing, using abstract nouns ("gratitude," "goodbye") to convey emotional states. Phrases like "blue as forgetting" and "painful as lamp oil" register as writerly flourishes that obscure clarity. The logical contradiction of placing the glass on the cairn and then pocketing it in the next breath is a significant choreography artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The story executes the "lonely lighthouse ghost" trope competently but without a fresh twist or subversive angle to distinguish it from the genre standard. The "Silent Skipper" concept is promising but serves mostly as setup for the correspondence rather than a driver of unique action. It feels like a safe, cozy execution of a familiar premise.</comment>
