<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Maya is defined primarily by her "debunker" label, and her pivot from truth-seeker to secret-keeper feels rushed due to the story's compression. Her competence relies heavily on "intuiting" answers rather than demonstrated deduction, which flattens the intellectual struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central investigation is summarized ("Hours passed") rather than dramatized, which lowers the tension of the discovery. While the closure works conceptually, the logic—that the "comfortable lie" protects the orchard better than the truth—relies on unarticulated assumptions about the survivors' psychology.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The contrast between the "rust-colored" wasteland and the "impossibly green" orchard creates a strong, immediate visual anchor. The "Stillpoint" concept is well-integrated into the physical setting, efficiently grounding the sci-fi elements in the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are high (survival of the orchard), but the conflict is primarily intellectual and resolved through a montage rather than active struggle. The antagonist pressure from the survivors remains off-page and abstract, reducing the immediate dramatic heat of the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue and narration ("Maya knew better than to trust comfortable lies"), leaving little room for subtext. While the moral cost of the "Stillpoint" is engaging, the didactic delivery flattens the potential nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice uses filter verbs ("intuited," "understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The perspective tends to summarize realizations ("the truth had assembled itself") rather than letting the reader arrive at them alongside the character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is serviceable but marred by clichés ("terrible mosaic") and telling ("sharply observant gaze"). The required action "intuit" is used awkwardly as a verb to bypass showing the investigative work, and the pacing during the middle section feels summary-heavy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "Stillpoint" as a scientific explanation for a magical curse is a clever synthesis of genre tropes. However, the resolution—burning the evidence to preserve the myth—is a familiar beat executed competently but without significant structural risk or freshness.</comment>
