<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is compelling, rooted in a specific, dramatized deficit (lack of privacy), and the neighbor flashback effectively grounds the stakes. The internal shift is legible, though the final emotional state feels slightly more summarized than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the inciting incident drives directly to the resolution with strong closure. However, the convenience of possessing the specific textbook needed to decode the rare artifact softens the causal difficulty; the solution feels somewhat "pre-packed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "hanging orchard" is an evocative, specific setting that mirrors the protagonist's precarious existence. The antique eye is described with excellent sensory detail ("pale blue with gold flecks"), grounding the sci-fi element in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the storm adds atmospheric pressure, but the antagonist forces are largely static (the past virus, the weather). The climax resolves with relatively low resistance (pressing the object), lacking a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The exploration of the trade-off between empathy and privacy is nuanced and lands well. The ending resonates with the premise, offering a clear conceptual pricing of solitude over painful connection (the "fractured grace").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. There is a slight distance in the narration that keeps the reader observing Mara rather than fully inhabiting her immediate sensory experience during the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but suffers from filter loops in the climax ("Mara's rational mind catalogued," "The rational part of her noted"). These repetitive filters distance the reader from the action at the pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "empathy as curse" trope is familiar, but the specific combination with the "hanging orchard" and the "glass eye" technology creates a fresh aesthetic. The synthesis of rustic setting and sci-fi elements is effective.</comment>
