<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena is a distinct, competent professional whose "methodical curiosity" logically drives the investigation, avoiding the passive observer trap. However, she lacks significant internal conflict or personal stakes; her journey is purely intellectual, and the absence of a visceral cost or contradictory impulse limits the character's depth beyond her functional role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, moving from the assignment to the film comparison and finally to the "archaeological wound" recommendation. The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing of the site's value, though the sudden availability of the geological survey to confirm the grass pattern feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "rain-scoured fresco vault" is a highly effective, atmospheric setting that thematically mirrors the erasure and silence of the henge. Specific details like the "axial shift" affecting the shadows ground the analysis in physical reality, elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily interpretive—understanding the site versus documenting stability—which keeps the stakes low and cerebral. While the pattern-break (the head tilt, the spiral) provides a necessary turning point, the lack of external pressure or an antagonist results in a quiet, low-tension arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of interpreting silence is woven beautifully through the imagery of the frescoes and the film, but the final paragraph falters by explicitly summarizing the thesis ("map of human longing... where certainty ended and faith began"). This "Thematic Echo" explains the resonance rather than letting the powerful image of the exposed wound speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, meditative, and precise, perfectly suiting the protagonist's profession as a map framer. It maintains a stable psychic distance that allows for intellectual observation, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly heavy-handed abstraction ("silence became interpretable").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "ghostly suggestions" and the "archaeological wound." A few abstract phrasings ("where cartography becomes faith," "shielded openness") slightly dilute the concrete impact of the visual details, but the overall line-level craft is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of map restoration, silent film analysis, and archaeology offers a fresh, specific perspective on the familiar "ancient mystery" trope. The specific resolution—to leave the "archaeological wound" exposed rather than repairing it—is a nuanced and original conceptual turn.</comment>
