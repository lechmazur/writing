<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict—her sense of complicity in the erasure—adds necessary weight to the "noticer" archetype, grounding her agency in guilt rather than just observation. The shift from guerrilla gardener to archivist of memory feels earned, though the realization is sparked somewhat passively by the ghostly encounter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (the decision to plant the east wing) acts as a resonant reconfiguration of the initial stakes. However, the central turn relies heavily on the old woman's expository dialogue to explain the story's mechanics and the protagonist's own motivation, which saps some tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere of erasure is excellent; the specific details of the smooth wall replacing the bakery and the encroaching moss effectively literalize the concept of creeping normality. The setting acts as an antagonist, constraining reality and forcing the protagonist's response.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and well-escalated—memory versus oblivion—and the cost is felt in the bread, which becomes a relic of a lost reality. The conflict is quiet but persistent, resolving in a stance of endurance ("holy persistence") that fits the story's scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the underlying concept of resistance through small acts is strong, the theme is explicitly diagnosed by the dialogue ("You plant to find the sacred in the ordinary"). This thematic echo serves as a direct statement of the prompt requirement, flattening subtext into text and reducing interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, managing the magical realism elements with confidence. The transition between the objective observation of the ruins and the surreal tea house encounter is handled smoothly without breaking POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density in descriptions like the "smooth expanse of wall." The phrase "heuristically gentle" creates a slight register clash, though the attribution to the grandmother attempts to smooth it; overall, the line-level craft is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Literalizing "creeping normality" as physical erasure is a fresh, engaging premise that elevates the guerrilla gardening trope. The synthesis of archaeology and gardening provides a distinct and memorable lens on the theme of memory.</comment>
