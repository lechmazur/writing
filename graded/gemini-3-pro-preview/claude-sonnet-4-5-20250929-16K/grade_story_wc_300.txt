<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s transformation relies on diagnostic label-speak ("I forgot how to feel") rather than embodied struggle. The emotional pivot is swift and unearned, fueled by reading a journal rather than a dramatized confrontation with her own numbness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear and orientation is solid. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (altering the report, joining the ritual), though the reliance on a "journal that explains everything" is a convenient structural shortcut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric detailing is vivid ("quartz columns," "latent radiance"), effectively creating the temple-like vibe. However, descriptions occasionally veer into "purple" territory ("frozen prayers") rather than staying grounded in the inspector's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The conflict (duty vs. sentiment) is present but low-stakes; the opposition from protocol dissolves almost instantly. The "hesitation" is stated rather than felt as a high-pressure trade-off with visible risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme is delivered via explicit statement in the journal and narration ("walls between hearts... dissolved"), triggering the penalty for moralizing in the final paragraph. Subtext is replaced by direct instruction to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, causing the inspector's internal monologue to blur indistinguishably with the poetic journal entries. The professional distance established early dissolves too quickly into lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten with heavy metaphorical padding ("geometric hearts," "frozen prayers"). "Contagion of courage" is a jarring mixed metaphor in the final beat that muddles the intended uplifting tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The inversion of the bunker as a site of emotional cultivation is a fresh concept. However, the execution relies on the derivative device of finding a diary that explains the plot and theme, reducing narrative ingenuity.</comment>
