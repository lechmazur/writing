<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is a competent focalizer, but she lacks the contradictory impulses or internal friction required for higher bands. Her motivation ("heartfelt dedication," "magnetic calm") is labeled rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and her competence faces no character-specific challenge that forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural that functions clearly but fails the "cost" test for closure; the ending is a serene return to stasis without a legible price paid (emotional, relational, or opportunity). The drive lens is situational, but the resolution feels frictionless and lacks the requisite "decisive change" or "reconfiguration" with weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory integration creates a vivid, specific atmosphere; the water basin acts as an effective micro-setting that constrains the repair process. The depot's "bones" and the "groan of machinery" ground the scene well, though the imagery leans slightly into standard atmospheric tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes are low and purely external (fixing a toy); while the repair process has steps, there is no escalation of pressure or risk of failure. The background departure of the *Mercantile* offers textural contrast but does not force a decision or impose a time cost on the primary action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of healing broken things is coherent but articulated through explicit labels ("magnetic calm," "prayer than repair") rather than subtext. The resonance relies on asserting significance through interiority summaries rather than earning it through the friction of the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and effectively filters the world through Mara's non-visual senses (vibration, heat). The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical texture that suits the "magnetic calm" tone, though it occasionally filters immediate experience through "she knew" or "she understood."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally dense with explaining adjectives ("heartfelt," "practiced," "delicate"). Some metaphors ("breathing thing," "sound like contentment") border on cliché, but the technical descriptions of the water diagnosis are distinct and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central conceit—diagnosing tech repairs through water refraction and vibration—is a fresh, specific synthesis of the prompt elements. However, the surrounding narrative frame (foggy depot, maiden voyage) feels like standard genre furniture, and the emotional arc is safe.</comment>
