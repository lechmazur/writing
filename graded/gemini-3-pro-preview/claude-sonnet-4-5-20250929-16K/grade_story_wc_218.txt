<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies entirely on summary rather than dramatized scenes, preventing access to Marina’s immediate interiority or contradictory impulses under pressure. While her motivation is stated, it lacks the friction of on-page decision-making; we are told she felt "brazen calm" rather than seeing it tested against the reality of her decline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The structure reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a fully realized story, violating the single-scene expectation without a functional mosaic alternative. The "and-then" sequencing lacks causal tension; the problem is identified and solved with procedural ease ("within days... cracks stopped spreading"), leading to a mechanically tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting concept—living stone pillars breathing mist—is imaginative and vivid, providing the story's strongest element. However, the summary mode keeps these details at a distance; the sensory experience is described to the reader rather than inhabited by the character during a specific moment of action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; Marina identifies a problem and immediately implements a solution that works without complication or cost. The potential tension between her failing health and the temple's needs is stated but not dramatized, resulting in a flat trajectory where the antagonist (entropy/death) offers no meaningful pushback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final diary entry ("The secret isn't domination. It's listening"), which functions as a "Thematic Echo" penalty. The theme is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging organically from the narrative struggle, reducing subtext to zero.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished but suffers from a "fable-like" distance that precludes emotional intimacy. The POV shift to the new caretaker at the end, while functionally providing closure, feels like a structural convenience rather than an earned perspective shift in such a short space.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is the story's standout strength, with crisp phrasing like "acupuncture for geology" and "ancient teeth." The prose is rhythmically sound and polished, though it occasionally lapses into scaffold-heavy summary ("She worked in a gently systematic way") to bridge time gaps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The central concept of architectural symbiosis is creative, but the execution falls into the "dying mentor leaves diary" trope without subverting it. The "acupuncture for geology" idea offers a spark of ingenuity, but the predictable plot trajectory limits its impact.</comment>
