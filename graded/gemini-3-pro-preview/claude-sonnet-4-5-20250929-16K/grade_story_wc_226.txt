<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict—her artistic defiance versus the weight of her guilt—is dramatized effectively through her attempt to manipulate the echoes. Her shift from rationalization ("innocently mischievous") to acceptance is earned by the failure of her tactic, creating a clear arc. The emotional cost is felt in her abandonment of the paints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight causal loop where the protagonist’s specific counter-move (poetry) directly triggers the realization (amplification vs. refraction) that resolves the plot. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the final walk toward the spire signals acceptance with undeniable cost. The drive lens remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the bone towers and their acoustic properties function as the antagonist that dismantles Mira’s defense. Sensory details like the "broken fingers" and "breathing fog" establish a vivid, oppressive atmosphere. (Capped at 8.8 per global gate rules as Q2 is <9.0).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stakes are high (judgment/soul), and the conflict escalates as Mira’s poetic attempts turn from defiance to a horrifying reinforcement of her guilt. The pressure is coherent, though the climax relies on an internal realization triggered by the environment rather than a direct confrontation with another character.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of truth’s indivisibility is woven into the mechanics of the story; the canyon’s refusal to "scatter" the truth offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of the "whole, sharp" truth provides a satisfying conceptual repricing of her initial artistic relativism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somewhat elevated, mythic tone that suits the setting and the protagonist's artistic background. The integration of the poetry verses is smooth and serves the narrative rather than distracting from it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("surfaces smooth as polished ivory," "accumulated guilt"), avoiding scaffold and maintaining strong momentum. The imagery supports the tone well, though a few phrases lean slightly into adjectival density ("innocently mischievous," "contradictory symphonies").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "canyon of echoes" mechanic with a moral judgment narrative is fresh and well-executed. While the trope of the artist facing the consequences of their work is familiar, the specific implementation here feels distinct and visually memorable.</comment>
