<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, functional protagonist who drives the plot but lacks internal friction or conflicting impulses. Her motivation is clear ("quietly driven"), but she faces no significant emotional or character-based obstacles; she unlocks doors and reads codes without a "crucible" moment that tests her values or forces a costly trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure is resonant, but the middle section relies on convenience. The existence of "emergency hatches the council had forgotten" removes the physical obstacle of the sealed gate too easily, and the pattern language revealing the truth "immediately" shortcuts the process of discovery, reducing narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, utilizing the "sunwashed dread" and the "humid darkness" of the shell-caverns to great effect. The sensory details of the spiral grooves and the perpetual sea-glare ground the fantastical premise in a tactile reality that enhances the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the global stakes are high (the fate of the city), the immediate scene pressure is low. Mira encounters no active opposition from the Council or the environment; her descent and investigation proceed linearly without a moment where she must risk something personal or overcome a direct threat to succeed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus comforting ignorance lands well, particularly with the "livestock" reveal. The final image of the watchers turning their attention provides a chilling, resonant answer to the central thematic question without needing to state the moral explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, controlled, and consistent, maintaining a mythic but grounded tone throughout. The perspective remains firmly with Mira, and the modulation of distance during the revelation of the expedition's fate is handled with skill.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is high-quality with strong information density and evocative phrasing ("sunwashed dread," "hinges had fused with salt and time"). The rhythm supports the pacing well, accelerating appropriately during the revelation and slowing for the heavy, final confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "city on a turtle" is a familiar trope, but the specific twist of the city being livestock guided by shepherds adds a fresh, dark dimension. The "spiral-shell cartography" is an inventive method for decoding the world, though the mechanics of the cracking shells feel slightly convenient.</comment>
