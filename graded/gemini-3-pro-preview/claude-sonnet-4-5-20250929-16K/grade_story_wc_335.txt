<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Miren is a distinct focalizer with a clear voice, but Kael functions more as a prop for the lesson than a fully realized agent. Her transformation from defiant to resilient occurs primarily within a summary montage ("across dozens of cups"), which elides the internal struggle and makes the emotional shift feel unearned by immediate scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative sets up a compelling premise but resolves the central obstacle through a summary bridge rather than a dramatized causal turning point. The leap from diagnosis to cure happens off-screen during the tea montage, weakening the causal chain that leads to the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is a strength, particularly the "afternoon shadow caught... like amber" and the auditory detail of the swing. The setting actively constrains the interaction, forcing the characters into the stillness required for the lesson.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The conflict is verbal and low-stakes on the page; Kael's resistance dissolves quickly without forcing Miren to adapt her tactics significantly. The resolution relies on the passage of time (the montage) rather than a decisive, high-pressure choice with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("Resilience isn't about armor...") rather than emerging organically from the action. This direct moralizing flattens the subtext and reduces the interpretive space for the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and controlled, maintaining a consistent third-person perspective anchored in Miren. The tone appropriately balances the magical and the clinical, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into instructional exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("scuffing the dusty floorboards in reverse"). The final simile ("carrying her resilience like a lantern") borders on ornamental, but the line-level execution is generally clean and dense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of "reversible exile" stored in archive glass is inventive and fresh. However, the execution—a mentor teaching patience over tea—treads familiar ground, saved largely by the specific, physical detail of walking backwards.</comment>
