<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to preserve the crater is clear and drives the narrative effectively. However, her interiority relies on somewhat stock sentimental tropes ("asked why stars died") rather than specific, embodied struggle. The connection to the grandfather provides emotional grounding but feels slightly derivative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly structured around the countdown, with a satisfying payoff involving the chemical flares. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration—she loses the land but captures its essence. The timeline and causal stakes are well-managed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lunar atmosphere is visually vivid, but scientific credibility suffers from significant lapses, notably cameras "clicking and whirring" in a vacuum and the logistics of a portable chemical darkroom in a suit. These "hard sci-fi" errors break immersion in a setting defined by technical constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The external pressure (bulldozers) and internal pressure (legacy) create a cohesive drive. The stakes are felt, and the choice to spend the final moments creating art rather than fighting a legal battle is a meaningful exercise of agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation against erasure is resonant, though the execution leans toward the sentimental ("slower, more honest"). The final image successfully crystallizes the theme, elevating the loss into a form of eternal ownership.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the melancholy tone. It occasionally drifts into purple prose ("dressed in chemical fire," "asteroid's kiss") which can feel overwrought for the otherwise technical context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose has momentum, but the "sound in vacuum" error ("whirred") is a major line-level flaw for this genre. Additionally, heavy-handed similes ("like history itself crumbling") reduce the impact of the otherwise solid descriptive work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core mechanism of using sunrise-triggered chemical reactions to photograph the crater is an ingenious and fresh take on the "farewell to a place" trope. It adds a layer of technical specificity that elevates the premise.</comment>
