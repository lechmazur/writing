<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is rendered with high specificity, grounding her immortal weariness in concrete desires ("photosynthesize pain"). The shift from solitary writer to collaborative gardener is earned through the interaction with Mira, creating a credible emotional arc. Motivation is clear and drives the climax effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Causal/Hybrid line from isolation to connection, anchored by the arrival of the postcard and then Mira. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the act of planting creates a "close to rest" state that resolves the opening insomnia without a cheap fix. The structure is tight and efficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting of the gargantuan shell is excellent, functioning as both shelter and resource (collecting rain/soil) to enable the climax. The "pearlescent interior" and "dust plains" create a vivid, specific atmosphere that constrains the characters' options and creates a unique stage for the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and emotional but clearly defined: the risk of hope versus the safety of despair. The "blossom armistice" concept sharpens the conflict, making the planting of the bulb a meaningful act of defiance with felt cost (the potential for loss). Pressure escalates naturally through the dialogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in ruin is cohesive and resonates through the imagery of the shell and the cherry blossoms. The "blossom armistice" serves as a strong thematic anchor that integrates the characters' different approaches to survival (writing vs. gardening) into a unified resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for a poet protagonist. The prose maintains a distinct texture ("star-thick sky," "constellation of correspondence") that supports the mood without slipping into melodrama. Psychic distance is well-controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong sentence variation. A few phrases ("reef-shadow joy," "photosynthesize pain") border on purple but fit the established poetic voice. The line-level craft supports the dreamlike quality of the narrative without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The image of an immortal poet living in a giant shell on a dried-up ocean bed is a fresh, striking synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes. While the "planting a garden at the end of the world" motif is familiar, the specific execution and the "blossom armistice" frame give it a unique identity.</comment>
