<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Adelaide’s internal conflict is sharply drawn, and her motivation to prioritize truth over legacy is earned through the specific "proof by contradiction" intellectual exercise. The transition from detached observer to active participant is credible, and the cost of her decision is felt. The use of "inner chaos" is slightly abstract, but the resulting agency is decisive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and efficient, moving from the inciting phone call to the logical pivot and final decision without wasted motion. The closure is a clear Decisive Change with acknowledged cost (family credibility). The orientation is immediate, and the "proof by contradiction" serves as an excellent structural hinge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting is more than a backdrop; it functionally contrasts the "realm beyond consequence" with the messy earth below. Specific details like the "rosewood pen nib" and "silver nitrate" ground the scene physically. The dome's acoustics effectively externalize the internal thematic conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high—personal legacy versus historical truth. The escalation is handled well through the forensic examination of the photos, raising the pressure until the final choice. The cost is not just theoretical but explicitly acknowledged as the destruction of her grandfather's reputation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme is coherent, but the dialogue "Legacy without truth is just mythology" articulates the thesis too explicitly, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. While the final image of the "honest orbit" is resonant, the direct statement of the moral reduces the subtextual power of the decision itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending the elevated tone of the setting with the sharp logic of the protagonist. The POV remains tightly anchored in Adelaide’s perspective. The transition from the "wobble" of her orbit to the "solemn" resolution is reflected well in the narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery ("clouds shifted like half-remembered lies"). There is a slight tendency toward adjective-heavy phrasing ("solemn meditation," "odd lightness"), but the rhythm generally supports the gravity of the scene without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a descendant uncovering an ancestor's crime is a standard trope, but the specific integration of the "proof by contradiction" logical method as the mechanism for emotional resolution adds a fresh, specific intellectual layer. The execution elevates a familiar setup.</comment>
