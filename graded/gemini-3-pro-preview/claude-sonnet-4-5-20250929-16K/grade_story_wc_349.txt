<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is a competent, consistent focalizer with a clear professional objective, but she lacks the internal contradiction or struggle required for higher bands. Her journey is procedural—she enters, performs a task without significant obstacles or difficult choices, and leaves. The narrative lacks a "crucible" moment where her values are tested against a cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, gathering density until the "conceptual repricing" closure where silence is revealed as the origin of story. The structure is elegant and the closure is legible, though the "cost" is primarily conceptual (carrying the weight of the world's pain) rather than visceral or dramatic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the glass floor and its incisions actively constrain the protagonist's actions and dictate the flow of the scene. The "waking" of the crystal trees provides a dynamic environmental clock that successfully pressures the exit, integrating world-building directly into narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dramatic tension is low. While the concept is engaging, the story lacks a distinct antagonist or a tightening of stakes; Mira faces no risk of failure and pays no immediate personal price. The "lull" timeframe removes urgency rather than adding it, resulting in a contemplative vignette rather than a conflict-driven narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The thematic exploration of memory, erasure, and origin is sophisticated and lands a resonant conclusion without becoming overly moralistic. The "glimmering parole" and the paradox of needing to understand in order to forget act as a strong intellectual spine that coheres well with the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and appropriately atmospheric, matching the ethereal nature of the setting. Interiority is well-calibrated to the professional distance of a "clean slate vendor," though it occasionally leans into exposition to explain her philosophy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density and strong rhythm. There is a slight tendency toward adjectival stacking ("mindfully scattered," "deliberately forgotten"), but the imagery of the moonlight pooling like mercury effectively anchors the abstractions in concrete sensory detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of mapping stories through the physical measurement of absence in a glass library is highly original and imaginatively executed. The synthesis of "clean slate" vendor mechanics with the physical setting creates a fresh, memorable fantasy vignette.</comment>
