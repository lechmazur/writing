<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera possesses distinct interiority and a clear professional voice, but her emotional arc resolves too smoothly. The shift from deep guilt over a colony-wrecking error to philosophical acceptance feels unearned, as the "magic" of the pen allows her to bypass the difficult reckoning with her mistake's consequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "soft reset" closure where the central problem (starving colonists/wrong seeds) is intellectualized away without a felt cost. The resolution—settlers finding "comfort" in multiple timelines—dissolves the stakes rather than confronting them, resulting in a low-consequence ending that strains credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is evocative and specific, blending the technological (observation pod) with the surreal (bent light, lichen). The environment actively participates in the narrative logic, particularly how the gravitational anomaly interacts with the pen to visualize the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the initial stakes are high (2,000 lives), the conflict deflates rather than escalates. The resolution—where settlers are simply happy with "simultaneous futures"—removes the pressure of their physical reality, solving a survival crisis with a philosophical abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of multiplicity and interpretation is coherent but suffers from explicit moralizing in the final beats. The story explains its thesis ("Vera understood now that she'd never planted wrong seeds") rather than trusting the resonant image of the unbent light to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and suitably atmospheric, effectively merging scientific lexicon with poetic abstraction. The control over psychic distance is strong, maintaining a tight focus on Vera's perception throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with effective imagery ("rearranging themselves like startled birds"). The writing maintains good momentum, though the climax relies slightly on summary ("The response came weeks later") rather than dramatized action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept of "editing history" via a grandfather's fountain pen and a gravitational anomaly is inventive and fresh. The fusion of analog tools with quantum concepts creates a memorable aesthetic, even if the plot resolution treads familiar "multiverse as therapy" ground.</comment>
