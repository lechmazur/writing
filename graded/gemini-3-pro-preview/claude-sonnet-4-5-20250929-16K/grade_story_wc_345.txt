<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mirela functions more as a benevolent plot device than a complex character; her motivation is clear but static, lacking internal contradiction or difficult choices beyond the physical toll of her manifestation. Kess serves primarily as a reactive mouthpiece for the theme rather than a fully realized agent. The emotional arc is serviceable but lacks the specific, embodied interiority required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage, moving quickly through conflicts that would benefit from dramatization. While the closure (Mirela resting) is distinct, the climax is resolved too neatly via a speech and a unanimous vote, which lowers the sense of earned narrative weight. The pacing is competent for a fable-like structure but lacks the granular causality of a literary short story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the low-gravity orchard, suspended droplets, and "violet clouds" of the nebula create a vivid, consistent atmosphere. Specific details like the copper bell and the floating arches ground the speculative elements effectively. The environment feels lived-in and integral to the community's survival logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Escalation suffers significantly from the "unanimous vote" resolution, which deflates the tension of the merchant ship's arrival immediately. The conflict between greed and community is stated rather than dramatized through genuine struggle or costly trade-offs. The ease with which the community rejects wealth for idealism reads as false complexity without on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered didactically through all-caps chalk messages ("I DIED SO YOU COULD LIVE DIFFERENTLY") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This heavy-handed approach leaves little room for reader interpretation or nuance. The story moralizes explicitly, replacing thematic resonance with instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality ("brambled with hope"). Dialogue, particularly Kess’s line "We orchestrate this together," feels unnatural and forced to fit a prompt requirement rather than arising from character voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and fluid, with strong imagery in the opening paragraph. However, some descriptions lean purple ("blazing with spectral light"), and the "brambled hope" phrasing feels slightly overwrought. The line-level craft is competent but lacks the sharp economy of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of a benevolent grandmother ghost organizing a community is charming but executed with standard tropes of the genre. The story functions well as a cozy sci-fi fable but lacks the risky, specific synthesis or subversion of expectations needed for a higher score in originality.</comment>
