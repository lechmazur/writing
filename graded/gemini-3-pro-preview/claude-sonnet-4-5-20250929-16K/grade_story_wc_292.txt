<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is legible, but Dr. Yoon’s conversion is too rapid; he shifts from hostility to collaboration the moment the prop is revealed, lacking the friction of a true "reversible exile" mindset. The attribute "nervously confident" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a "magic object" logic where a 2019 nail solves a future chaotic system via microscopic etching, which strains causality. The closure (publishing via poetry) is a distinct change, but the path there feels frictionless and relies heavily on the prop rather than character agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, with details like "verdigris patina," "colors that shouldn't exist," and the "rusted sentinel" creating a strong atmospheric container. The environment effectively mirrors the isolation of the characters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The conflict de-escalates too quickly; the antagonist (the government/exile board) is abstract, and Yoon offers minimal resistance. The stakes are global, but the immediate on-page pressure is low because the solution is accepted without a felt cost or trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of art preserving science is clear but explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("overlooked legacy finally found its voice"). The resonance relies on telling the reader the significance rather than letting the "poetry as code" metaphor carry the weight implicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, though the voice leans into adjectival characterization ("idealistic map librarian," "professionally ostracized"). The narrative distance is stable, but the transition to the shared determination at the end feels slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is functional but marred by the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "nervously confident" in both the opening and climax, creating a scaffold artifact. "Spongey dread" is also inserted somewhat awkwardly as a label for internal state.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of climatology, nautical poetry, and archival resistance is imaginative and fresh. While the execution leans on convenient tropes (the hidden key), the core concept of encoding survival data in verse is compelling.</comment>
