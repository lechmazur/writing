<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lysa’s dual nature is executed with precision; the transition from trembling senility to steely competence is sharp and satisfying. Her motivation is deeply felt and integrated into her craft ("unheard stories"), though Kael serves as a somewhat stock antagonist with melodramatic markers like "sneer" and "hissed."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal arc is tight and effective, moving from deception to a decisive, irrevocable act of sabotage that fundamentally alters the situation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the "rippling" map and "jagged crimson light" serve as a tangible manifestation of the coup's undoing with clear stakes attached.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional, with the "cobalt observatory" and its acoustic properties amplifying the tension between Kael’s noise and Lysa’s silence. Specific details like the "single meteorite of blue stone" and "filament of spun nebula" ground the fantastical elements in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established through the timeframe and the looming coup, creating immediate pressure. The conflict shifts smoothly from the external interrogation to the internal/technical challenge of the embroidery, maintaining tension through the "synchronization" beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of weaving truth into reality is integrated organically into the plot mechanics rather than just serving as window dressing. The contrast between Kael’s loud ambition and Lysa’s "echoed silence" resonates well at the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, managing the shift between the feigned dialogue and the lyrical interiority without jarring the reader. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Lysa’s sensory experience, enhancing the immersion of the embroidery sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative ("time is just a loop of thread"), but occasional melodramatic verb choices ("hissed," "booming") and slightly purple phrasing ("decaying scent of ending cycles") prevent a higher score. The rhythm and density are otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of traditional textile craft with high-tech space navigation is a fresh, engaging concept that elevates the standard "secret rebel" trope. The specific visualization of "stitching gravity wells" offers a unique aesthetic to the sabotage.</comment>
