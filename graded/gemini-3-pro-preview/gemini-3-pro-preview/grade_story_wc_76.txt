<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but the protagonist lacks internal conflict or genuine struggle. Elias is hyper-competent and devoid of hesitation, resulting in a static character arc where he faces no significant doubts or trade-offs. The emotional landscape is somewhat flat, focused entirely on technical anticipation rather than the advertised "bleak exhilaration."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is logical and coherent, leading to a clear Decisive Change (reversing the tide). However, the narrative trajectory is extremely linear—problem, build, fix, success—without complications or the "felt cost" required for higher bands. The victory feels unearned in terms of narrative sacrifice; the solution works perfectly on the first try.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong integration of the lighthouse and hunger stone; the setting acts as a crucial tool in the resolution (the Fresnel lens amplifying the light). The sensory details of the receding ocean and the "wet, malicious" stone effectively ground the stakes in the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (famine, doom), but the protagonist dominates the conflict with ease. The pressure is purely external (time/tide); there is no escalation of tactical difficulty or narrowing of choices, as Elias’s plan proceeds without a hitch. The resolution lacks a "paid price," reading as a pure triumph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of engineering dismantling destiny is cohesive and lands clearly in the final image. While the message is somewhat explicit ("destiny was merely another mechanism"), it resonates well with the established conflict. The ending successfully reweights the concept of fate, even if the execution is a bit triumphant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the fable-like, steampunk tone. The perspective remains firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his mechanical obsession ("anticipation of a surgeon"). The tone supports the "man vs. nature" concept effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten with adjectival clusters ("wet, malicious promise," "cold electric thrill," "neatly inventive grace"). Some imagery leans on clichés ("pricked at his skin"), though the description of the machinery and light is vivid and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A creative synthesis of elements; reimagining a yoyo as a gyroscope to reverse tides via a lighthouse is a fresh, specific concept. The "clockmaker vs. hunger stone" dynamic offers a unique spin on the "cheating fate" trope, managing to feel inventive despite the straightforward plot.</comment>
