<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The protagonist’s profession is distinct and compelling, providing a strong foundation for the narrative. However, emotional states are often reported via diagnostic labeling ("guilt," "twisted in the agony," "tempered regret") rather than dramatized through behavior. The internal conflict is clear but resolved somewhat intellectually.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from descent to realization, with a legible closure unit (finding the watch hand). The retrieval of the specific watch hand from "driftwood" relies on fable-logic coincidence, but it effectively serves the closure. The pacing is steady, though the resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "Cobalt Terrace" and "psychic refuse" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. Specific details like "bruised luminescence" work well, though phrases like "auditory phenomenon" break the sensory immersion with academic distance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly established as internal peace versus professional malpractice. However, the external pressure (the wood’s false memories) is overcome too easily ("shaking his head"), reducing the tension. The climax relies on finding an object rather than a difficult active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of erasing history is tightly woven into the protagonist's unique trade. However, the subtext is frequently made explicit through narrator explanation ("metaphorically freezing their time," "currency... was the erasure"), which diminishes the resonant power of the symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the somber mood. There is a tendency towards "helpful narrator" syndrome, where the meaning of images is explained immediately after they are presented ("This was the physical link...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose has moments of high density ("gardener of bloodlines"), but suffers from register slips ("auditory phenomenon") and over-explanation of metaphors. Emotional beats are often summarized ("lacking the hysteria... possessing the density") rather than shown.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "black market genealogist" who grafts noble fictions onto common roots is highly original and engaging. The setting of a shore containing "psychic refuse" adds a unique, creative layer to the world-building.</comment>
