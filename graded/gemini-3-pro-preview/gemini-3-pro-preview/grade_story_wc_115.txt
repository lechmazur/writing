<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas has a distinct voice and consistent internal logic, but his primary motivation is delivered via expository summary ("motivation was singular and heavy") rather than dramatized conflict. The connection between his past negligence and the current setting feels constructed, and his epiphany is internal and relatively low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a high-magnitude coincidence—a random radio caller confessing the exact thematic answer Silas needs—to resolve the central mystery. While the "radio mapping" concept sets this up, the timing makes the resolution feel given by chance rather than earned by the protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is tactile and vivid ("damp brick," "beaded valve wheel"), and the invention of using radio static to map structural stress lines creates a unique, setting-specific constraint. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's method and movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the internal pressure is legible, but the escalation is largely atmospheric. The resolution comes from witnessing an external event (the radio confession) rather than the protagonist making a difficult, cost-bearing choice that forces the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of "negligence vs. malice" is coherent but undercut by explicit moralizing in the final beats ("judgment complete," "physics of a mistake"). The story explains its own metaphors to the reader rather than trusting the imagery to carry the resonant weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and fits the "industrial noir" tone, maintaining a steady distance. However, it occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing ("profound auditory void," "frantic, incoherent babble") that feels performative rather than grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on telling where showing is needed, particularly regarding character traits ("religiously skeptical") and motivation. Adjective-heavy descriptions ("heavy warmth," "crumbling industrial graves") occasionally clutter the sentence rhythm and slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of navigating physical space by interpreting talk-radio static as data is a fresh, ingenious mechanism that elevates the premise. While the "ghost as memory" trope is familiar, the technical execution of the radio mapping adds significant novelty.</comment>
