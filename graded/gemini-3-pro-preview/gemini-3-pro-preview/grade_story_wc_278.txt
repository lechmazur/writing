<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s past as a tattooist is brilliantly integrated into the sci-fi mechanic, turning a technical solution into a character-specific act of redemption. While the backstory of her "negligence" is delivered via summary rather than dramatized reveal, the physicalization of her grief through the modified stylus creates strong, embodied emotion that grounds the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal arc is clear, moving efficiently from the inciting boot sequence to the resonant closure of the trapped sound. However, the mid-scene exposition regarding "time folding" and the letters slightly drags momentum during the rising action, explaining the stakes rather than letting them manifest solely through pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "meteor hush" and the "insect trapped within" provide excellent sensory anchoring that serves the theme. The atmosphere effectively blends the sterile (console) with the organic (amber, cry), though the "warping geometry" description feels slightly generic compared to the vivid specificity of the amber and the stylus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of redeeming past guilt is clear, and the pressure escalates logically to the risk of shattering the fossil. While the climax relies on a competency check (using the stylus) rather than a difficult moral trade-off, the emotional cost is palpable and the internal conflict is resolved with weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The transformation of a baby’s cry into a "fixed point of light" creates a powerful, non-literal thematic resolution regarding grief and memory. The concept that echoes are "caught, not erased" lands with earned resonance, elevating the sci-fi premise into a durable emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, successfully merging technical terminology with poetic, emotional descriptors. There is a slight tendency toward personification ("code that wept") which fits the "haunted" tone but risks slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and flows well, though it occasionally relies on adverbs ("solely," "specifically," "fiercely") and slightly heavy modifiers. Some descriptions, like "physics of the moment collapsed," lack the freshness of the specific imagery found elsewhere, such as the ink-stained fingers on the console.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing, haunted firmware translating cries, and amber preservation is highly original and imaginatively executed. The premise takes a bold risk by mixing disparate elements into a cohesive, emotional logic that feels fresh and memorable.</comment>
