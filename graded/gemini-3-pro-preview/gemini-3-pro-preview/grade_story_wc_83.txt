<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias is a fiercely realized protagonist; the specific backstory ("burning lace," "ionized soil") anchors his obsession in visceral reality. The final micro-choice to sabotage the system creates a powerful, high-cost closure that confirms his descent from survivor to addict of the "unhappened."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the "cooling breakers" constraint, creating a natural, high-pressure window for the scene. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change—an active choice to break reality to regain the vision—perfectly satisfying the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The zero-gravity environment and the tactile details of the contracting metal and Geode crystal ground the metaphysical action. The setting is not just a backdrop but a physical constraint that dictates the pacing and the protagonist's movements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conflict is masterfully braided: the internal grief drives the action, while the external timeline of the resetting breakers provides the escalating pressure. The climax forces a trade-off between station safety (reality) and the "phantom limb" (potential), resulting in a visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of "physics of the unhappened" offers a profound thematic repricing of survivor's guilt, treating lost lives as a physical energy source. The "toxic hope" at the end creates a resonant, non-moralizing thematic conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally commanding and distinct, filtering the world through Elias's specific scientific-obsessive lens. A slight dip occurs with the insertion of required phrasing ("intangibly tangible"), which momentarily disrupts the otherwise seamless psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and evocative, with standout lines like "carved out of the negative space" and "mathematical waste product." The flow is only hindered slightly by the mechanics of integrating the prompt's specific adjectives, which occasionally feel less organic than the surrounding text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard science fiction (perturbation theory) with the emotional weight of a drone strike wedding is strikingly original. The story takes a familiar trope (grief) and transforms it through a unique, high-concept lens that feels inevitable.</comment>
