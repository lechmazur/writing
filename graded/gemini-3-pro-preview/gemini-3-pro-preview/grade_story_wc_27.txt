<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is defined by labels ("barefoot stargazer") and exposition rather than dramatic choice. Her motivation is abstract ("find the pattern"), and she faces no internal resistance or contradiction; her success is earned by innate ability rather than a difficult decision or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural—setup, execution, success—lacking a decisive turning point or complication. The closure is "symmetric satisfaction," resolving the goal exactly as intended without a felt or conceptual cost, failing the closure requirement for high bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The setting is functionally anchored but relies on genre clichés ("ragtag resistance," "ozone," "copper tang of dried blood"). The juxtaposition of ancient stones and high-tech is visual but lacks tactile or interactive depth beyond the vibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or dilemma. The "teeth-rattling" vibration is a somatic detail rather than a narrative obstacle, and the soldiers watching are passive furniture, resulting in zero escalation of stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("where the ancient past met the broken future") rather than emerging from the action. This reliance on summary and moralizing replaces subtext with assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The POV is a serviceable third-person limited that tends to explain rather than show ("she was known among," "her motivation clear"). The narrative voice is consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose is readable but marred by stock phrasing ("ragtag," "suffocating lull," "jagged slice"). Adjectival stacking ("colossal hangar doors," "stagnant," "silent and deliberate") slows momentum without adding fresh specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "techno-magic" trope is played straight without subversion or fresh specificity. The solution (humming at stones to fix a spaceship) feels like a standard fantasy convention transplanted without a unique twist or complication.</comment>
