<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict between survival instinct and duty is dramatized effectively through the physical struggle. The final choice to accept death ("content to become part of the signal") is a strong Earned Stasis that feels motivated by her established reverence for the history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving from the distress signal constraint to the physical obstacle (knot) and final release. Closure is definitive and resonant, reconfiguring the protagonist's state from intruder to permanent resident with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and functional, with the water pressure and "calcified knot" directly constraining the protagonist’s actions. The shift from the chaotic ocean noise to the "gathered hush" creates a vivid, atmospheric beat that serves the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as life-or-legacy, and the pressure escalates coherently via the hypoxia and the stubborn machinery. The cost is paid in full on the page, satisfying the requirement for a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory outlasting physical form is well-integrated into the plot mechanics (the perfume vial). While the thematic statement "history was more important than her heartbeat" is a bit explicit, the final image resonates strongly with the core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent and elevated, but technical slips in tense consistency ("resonance that touches memories," "as time runs short") disrupt the psychic distance and polish required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is descriptive but suffers from adjective/adverb density ("sucked greedily," "creep ominously") that occasionally slows momentum. The noted tense shifts ("touches," "runs") are mechanical flaws that mar the line-level execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi tech (broadcast hub) with sensory/fantasy elements (memory perfume) offers a fresh texture to the "last survivor" trope. The specific mechanism of the perfume vial elevates the standard distress signal plot.</comment>
