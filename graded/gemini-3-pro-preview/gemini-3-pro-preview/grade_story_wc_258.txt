<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "map cultural patterns" is compelling and drives the action. However, the pivotal internal shift from observer to whistleblower is summarized ("deciding to confide") rather than fully dramatized in the beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causality is tight; the physical act of measuring directly triggers the realization and the subsequent breach of protocol. The closure lands a strong Conceptual Repricing (the market as an engineered demolition) rooted in the scene's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of esoteric elements ("onyx ink") with "construction-grade" tools creates a vivid, grounded atmosphere. The setting details (rain, skylight) actively frame the final realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a client's financial anxiety to a revelation of global manipulation. The conceptual cost—the burden of witnessing a crime scene—is felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "architecture of loss" is integrated directly into the magic system's mechanics. The concept of reverse-engineering fate avoids abstract moralizing, grounding it in the physical props.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The noir-inflected voice is consistent and supports the "forensic mystic" persona. The tone manages the shift from mystical to conspiratorial without breaking narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The phrase "steadily curious" is repeated verbatim, creating a distracting prose artifact. Some sensory descriptions ("acrid, metallic tang," "pulse hammer") rely on stock phrasing that dulls the otherwise sharp imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy with structural engineering and drafting tools is highly original. It transforms the "fortune teller" trope into something fresh and methodologically distinct.</comment>
