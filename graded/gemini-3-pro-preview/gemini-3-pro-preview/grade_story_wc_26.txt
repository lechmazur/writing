<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian’s motivation is singular and compels the central action, creating a cohesive character arc defined by his role as a custodian. The internal cost is acknowledged ("victory was steep"), though the emotion is occasionally labeled ("felt a profound, luminous regret") rather than fully dramatized through physical interiority, which limits the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plot executes a clean Causal arc with a legible inciting incident (the video discrepancy) leading directly to a decisive climax (trapping the shadow). The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the stone is hidden and the cost is accepted—lands with clear weight, satisfying the high-band criteria for structure and cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, contrasting the ethereal "photosynthesizing verbs" with the heavy geological presence of the river stone. This contrast actively pressures the protagonist's choices and anchors the metaphysical stakes, elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high (the preservation of the soul’s depth), with the conflict escalating naturally from observation to intervention. The cost is specific and felt—the woman’s permanent loss of wholeness—providing a solid anchor for the philosophical conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of necessary darkness is woven seamlessly into the narrative action, avoiding abstract sermonizing until the very end. The final image of the dark stone amidst the glowing foliage successfully resonates with the central question of what is lost in a "perfect" collective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, lyrical tone that suits the subject matter. However, reliance on filter verbs ("He sensed," "He looked," "He felt") creates some unnecessary psychic distance, preventing a higher degree of intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("tumbler," "obsidian-like geode"), but suffers from "telling" emotional resonance ("emotional resonance vibrated... deep chord of finality") and consistent filtering. These artifacts blunt the immediacy of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "living library" trope with a forensic, geological approach to capturing lost souls feels fresh. The specific mechanics of the stone and shadow offer a distinct, non-obvious angle on the classic individuality-versus-collective dilemma.</comment>
