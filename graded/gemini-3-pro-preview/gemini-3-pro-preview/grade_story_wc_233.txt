<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Isolde’s weariness and transition to stewardship are well-rendered, with interiority that matches the mythic tone. The shift from queen to guardian is earned through the climb, though the moment of realization relies slightly on external prompts (the insects) rather than purely internal struggle. The relationship with Valerius provides a necessary foil but remains static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear linear drive with a coherent Causal lens: the dream motivates the climb, which leads to the sanctuary. However, the resolution—fireflies spontaneously forming a shield—reads as a convenient environmental feature rather than a result of the protagonist's direct agency, slightly softening the causal force of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, vivid, and integral to the plot; the "cobalt grotto" and "bleeding starlight" create a distinct, pressurized atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the climb and charges the final image of the ember sanctuary. (Capped at 8.8 due to Global 9+ Gate linking Q3 score to Q2 closure strength).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are high and legible—survival against cosmic annihilation. The tension escalates well during the climb. The resolution, however, arrives via the "tension breaking" and the insects appearing, which dissipates the pressure somewhat externally rather than through a final, costly decision from Isolde.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of natural cycles protecting against cosmic corruption is coherent and resonates in the final image. The "season protects itself" realization successfully reconfigures the protagonist's understanding of her power, shifting from rule to stewardship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident and appropriately elevated for the high-fantasy subject matter. The narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Isolde’s perception. A few phrases ("core concept of her nightmares") feel slightly diagnostic, but the overall texture is consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally lush and evocative ("ribcage of blue ice"), but suffers from minor register slips like "simple biological light" (clinical) and clunky phrasing ("aging intricate-clockwork artificer"). These artifacts slightly disrupt the mythic cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of "bleeding starlight" as a corrosive force is fresh and visually striking. The juxtaposition of cosmic horror with the small, warm safety of fireflies and magma offers a memorable and original aesthetic resolution.</comment>
