<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s somatic experience is visceral and distinct, grounding the narrative in a specific physical reality ("precise rotation of his axis"). However, the intellectual motivation ("mathematics of mercy") feels slightly imposed and abstract compared to the organic immediacy of the trauma responses, creating a slight disconnect between the character's primal state and his philosophical goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from disorientation to a decisive moment of conceptual repricing (removing the mask). The closure lands with clear cost (pain/radiation), though the causal logic of "solving the equation" via exposure relies on symbolic assertion rather than strict narrative necessity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and tightly integrated with the protagonist’s enhanced senses; the "frequencies that made his teeth ache" and the specific detail of the "pewter" strap build a unique, palpable atmosphere. The environment acts as a genuine pressure cooker that forces the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Internal and environmental pressures escalate clearly, driven by Kaelen's choice to enter the "brightest sector" and remove his protection. The stakes are felt on the page through somatic cost, though the adversary remains largely environmental and internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of navigating via "trauma responses" offers rich, organic subtext about living with past pain. However, the ending explicitly defines the theme ("mercy was not the absence of pain, but..."), converting a resonant realization into a direct thesis statement, which limits the interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending clinical terminology ("somatic," "proprioceptive") with elevated sensory imagery ("burnt sugar," "holy") to create a distinct texture. The psychological distance is well-calibrated, staying deep in Kaelen’s altered perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and effective ("varnish from a raw nerve"), driving the scene's intensity. There is a slight tendency toward adjective stacking ("sickly, vibrant hum"), but the prose maintains strong rhythm and momentum throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "trauma as a map" mechanic—where past pain guides the character through an alien landscape—is a genuinely fresh and compelling synthesis of character and setting. The "mathematics of mercy" frame is a more standard trope but is executed with sufficient specificity.</comment>
