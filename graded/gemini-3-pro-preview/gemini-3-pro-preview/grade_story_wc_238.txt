<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas is a distinct, weary protagonist, and his cynicism contrasts well with the client's raw need. However, the narrative scaffold explaining his trait ("He was fond of advising through metaphors...") distances the reader by telling rather than letting the dialogue stand alone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with excellent precision; the "imperfect miracle" functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the limitation is accepted with felt cost. The external framing device of the orchard provides a tight, effective clock that snaps shut at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is active and instrumental; using the archive's shelving as an induction cage grounds the magic in the physical space. The external atmosphere ("suffocating hush" of the orchard) effectively pressurizes the internal scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, escalating through the sensory intensity of the ritual. The resolution offers a meaningful trade-off: the connection is made, but the emotional catharsis is denied ("he didn't smile"), fulfilling the "imperfect" premise with integrity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core concept is woven well into the plot, though the final dialogue ("A broken mirror reflects the light...") tilts toward explicit thematic summary. The final image of the tree "screaming" resonates powerfully with the ghost's earlier silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent "ethereal noir" texture that suits the protagonist. The technical exposition in the dialogue ("spirit is electromagnetic residue") is functional but feels slightly stiff compared to the narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery is often vivid ("lignin and neglect," "burn mark of frost"), but the density of similes ("rusty needle," "pistol crack," "blocked pipe") occasionally clogs the rhythm. A lighter touch on the figurative language would improve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gossip columnist protagonist utilizing industrial "electromagnetic necromancy" within a sheet music archive is highly inventive. The specificity of the ritual mechanics elevates the premise above standard ghost-story tropes.</comment>
