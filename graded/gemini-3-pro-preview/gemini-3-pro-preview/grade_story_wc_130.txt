<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silas is a distinct focalizer with clear motivation, but the emotional arc relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ambiguous loss," "buried optimism") rather than embodied experience. The "gnawing motivation" is stated more than felt in the scene's pressure, though the ritual actions provide some character grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure; the result (data, not daughter) lands with legible cost. The drive lens is consistent, utilizing the ritual's logic to reach a meaningful, if cerebral, reconfiguration of the protagonist's grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, blending the subterranean environment ("mineral tears," "iron and dark water") directly with the narrative logic of the roots and the ritual. The physical space constrains and informs the magic system effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (resolving the daughter's fate) drives the narrative. The ritual provides a functional tightening of pressure, though the climax resolves somewhat quickly via the vision; the cost is felt in the separation between the viewer and the viewed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme is handled explicitly, with the text defining "ambiguous loss" and "mathematics of emotion" directly rather than allowing them to emerge subtextually. This overt articulation reduces the resonance of the ending, making the insight feel calculated rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately elevated for the "conjurer/mathematician" archetype. Psychic distance is stable, filtering the world clearly through Silas's analytical yet mystical perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery ("grinding teeth," "silver sap"), though it occasionally slips into abstract phrasing ("gelatinous uncertainty"). The rhythm supports the ritual's pacing, delivering a polished surface texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of geology, mathematics, and grief offers a fresh take on the necromancy trope. The specific mechanism of using geological cracks as an emotional algorithm is an ingenious and memorable detail.</comment>
