<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is a consistent focalizer with a distinct worldview, but his motivation ("to bottle the feeling of safety") is delivered via exposition rather than emerging from struggle. The relationship dynamic remains static, as Thomas serves primarily as a prop for Elias's competence rather than an active participant in a two-way exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear orientation and situational drive, but the closure relies on a soft reset where the terror "evaporates" instantly upon seeing the light. The resolution lacks a felt cost or complication, making the psychological shift feel convenient rather than earned by the preceding action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "vibration of the sea floor" and the "metal ringing" create a strong physical reality. The stone stack acts as an excellent micro-setting element that grounds the history of the place, though descriptions of the "haunted" atmosphere occasionally drift into abstract telling ("psychic weight") rather than concrete manifestation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the escalation is minimal; Elias encounters no significant obstacle in delivering the solution, and the antagonist (the crushing fear) yields immediately to the gesture. The lack of friction or trade-off in the climax flattens the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of silent, collaborative survival is resonant, particularly through the stone cairn motif. However, the narrative explicitly states its thematic thesis ("bottle the feeling of safety") rather than letting it arise organically from the subtext of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. At times, the narrative distance feels slightly too remote, prioritizing poetic observation over immediate immersion in the crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity ("human erosion," "deceit of words," "silence like a heavy coat"). The reliance on abstract descriptors for emotional states ("luminescent ache") lessens the visceral impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of the stone stack as a silent vernacular is a fresh, specific invention that elevates the standard "lighthouse storm" trope. The resolution, involving a wise mentor soothing a panicked novice with a symbolic object, feels more familiar and safe.</comment>
