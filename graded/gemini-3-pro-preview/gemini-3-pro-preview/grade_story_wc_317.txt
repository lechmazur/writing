<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is distinct and competent, but functions more as a vehicle for the concept than a character under pressure. Motivation is stated rather than tested; he faces no genuine internal resistance or flaw that complicates the "orthogonal" success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Causality relies on significant convenience; the seed blooms in hours to fit the narrative window without establishing a magical reality, breaking suspension of disbelief. The closure is a neat conceptual bow that lacks a paid cost or hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific, effectively grounding the "mad botanist" theme in the physical workspace. The description of the bloom and the "sullen heat" builds a strong, tangible atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain low and theoretical (a creative block); the conflict is resolved by the fortuitous arrival of the package and immediate success. The protagonist encounters no meaningful opposition or possibility of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of nurturing the strange is coherent but delivered via explicit summary in the final paragraphs. The resonance feels asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, intelligent, and fits the "designer" persona well. It occasionally drifts into slightly purple abstraction ("hush of a possibility") that distances the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but relies on several worn clichés ("liquid clarity," "tumbler falling into place," "not with a bang") which dilute the freshness of the imagery. Sentence rhythm is controlled but lacks variation in the middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of a corpse flower escape room is novel, but the execution—a hyper-competent expert instantly solving a problem with no setbacks—follows a safe, standard trajectory.</comment>
