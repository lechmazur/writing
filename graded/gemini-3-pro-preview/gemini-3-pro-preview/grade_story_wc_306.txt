<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivations are clear and the dynamic is legible, but Vance's transformation from "monolith" to broken child is swift and relies heavily on the mirror prop rather than earned internal struggle. The breakdown feels slightly mechanical given the short runway.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient with a clear Decisive Change at the end. Orientation is solid, though the resolution pivots on "magical" objects (mirror, cloak) that short-circuit a more complex causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are strong and specific ("rusting railing," "salt-crusted glass"). The setting actively participates in the diagnostic phase (wind chimes) and the atmospheric pressure (cold) aligns with the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are high and legible (bombardment), but the conflict dissolves quickly once the mirror is introduced. The opposition is overcome by the tool rather than a deeply escalated interpersonal contest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but handled explicitly, with dialogue and narration stating the thesis ("Certainty is a comfortable house," "tone of protected vulnerability") rather than letting it emerge purely through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like tone. Focalization is generally controlled, though the description of Vance's vision inside the mirror teeters on head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good momentum and imagery ("embers... surrendered"). Some descriptors lean toward the melodramatic ("chaotic orchestra," "monolith of conviction"), but the line-level craft is competent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "Conscience for Hire" is a compelling, fresh frame. However, the specific execution—a tough soldier breaking down upon seeing his inner child in a mirror—relies on a familiar trope.</comment>
