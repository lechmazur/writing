<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara is a competent, distinct protagonist with a clear role and skill set. However, her "dual allegiance" is stated rather than deeply felt as an internal conflict; she executes the plan with high competence and minimal on-page emotional cost or hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure—reconfiguring the city to stall eviction—lands effectively. However, the resolution relies on a somewhat convenient legal loophole regarding the "foundation stone" that strains plausibility, acting as a "magic gavel" rather than a grounded plot mechanic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "olfactory map" and "rusted, leaking pontoons" create a vivid, tangible atmosphere. The physical nature of the raft city is essential to the plot, allowing the reconfiguration mechanic to work seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (eviction/privatization) and pressure comes from the ticking clock of dawn. While the external tension is maintained, the antagonist (corporate surveyors) is off-screen, and Elara faces little direct opposition, making the victory feel slightly low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of chaotic, organic tradition versus rigid corporate zoning is well-integrated into the action of physically shifting the city. The reconfiguration serves as a resonant metaphor for resistance without becoming overly preachy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, suiting the "solarpunk" noir tone. Transitions between the technical details of the winches and the broader cultural implications are handled smoothly, maintaining a consistent POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("loomed like a judgment," "orchestrating a massive urban ballet"). While generally strong, it occasionally leans into summary for internal states ("fierce need to navigate gentrification") rather than dramatizing the feeling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a floating city rearranging itself to defeat zoning maps is highly original and engaging. The graffiti signaling system is a fresh, specific detail that elevates the heist element.</comment>
