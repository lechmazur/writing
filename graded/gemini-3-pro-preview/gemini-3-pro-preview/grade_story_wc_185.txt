<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara displays strong competence and clear motivation rooted in survival. However, the emotional arc is linear, and the cost of her victory is limited to physical exhaustion rather than a difficult internal trade-off or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible and the orientation is solid. The resolution, however, relies on a single successful action that instantly dissolves the threat, lacking the complications or "try-fail" cycles that create deeper narrative satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is excellent; the "frozen topographic map" of the lake is not just scenery but the essential tool for the protagonist's victory. The sensory details of sound and cold are vivid and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are high (survival/sanity), but the conflict resolves too cleanly with a "magic bullet" artifact. The lack of a visible trade-off or a moment where the plan nearly fails limits the tension at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "mapping peace" within chaos is resonant and well-supported by the geology/acoustics motif. The ending image of "thick and solid" silence lands the concept effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent with the mapkeeper's perspective. The focus on vibration and texture anchors the POV firmly in the character's expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is evocative with strong verbs ("scoured," "drowned") and specific imagery ("jagged lightning made of neon wire"). Rhythm is generally good, though occasional adjective triads ("heavy, final, and earned") slightly drag the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of geology and acoustics (reading ice cracks as sonic maps) is fresh and engaging. While the "energy being" antagonist is a standard trope, the protagonist's specific methodology elevates the concept.</comment>
