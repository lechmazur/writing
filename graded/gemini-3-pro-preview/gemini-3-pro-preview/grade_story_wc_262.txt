<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct ("desperate need") and agency is clear, but the protagonist's high competence removes the friction necessary for higher bands. The "predator" trait is stated but not tested by genuine struggle or significant internal conflict; she executes the procedure without doubt or error.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, moving from the physical strip to the metaphysical release. Closure lands firmly with a Conceptual Repricing (the lens as amber), though the lack of severe obstacles keeps the narrative arc somewhat flat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting and tools; the projector's limitations (lamp would burn film) constrain the method (psychometry), and the booth's geometry physically maps onto the vision. The environment actively shapes the magic system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation relies on atmospheric density (thunder, heat) rather than interpersonal or antagonistic pressure. While the cost is paid (destruction of the film artifact), it reads as a procedural transaction rather than a painful, high-stakes trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central question ("where unused love is stored") is answered with a resonant, non-literal image that recontextualizes the setting. The theme emerges organically from the action without heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, blending technical detail ("silver nitrate," "halide crystals") with lyrical interiority. The sensory signature is distinct ("vibrated in the sternum"), effectively grounding the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative with high information density. Minor overwriting appears in modifier stacks ("unnaturally spatially imaginative"), but the rhythm generally supports the rising atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—a projectionist using psychometry to store emotion in a lens—is a fresh, specific synthesis of noir aesthetics and urban fantasy. The concept feels earned and authentic rather than prompt-stitched.</comment>
