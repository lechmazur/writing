<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor is a distinct, highly competent focalizer, but she lacks genuine internal conflict or vulnerability; her "desperate need" is stated but not dramatized in her cool, efficient dismantling of the antagonist. The absence of a character-specific flaw or a difficult choice with visible personal cost limits engagement and depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal path, but the resolution relies on a weak antagonist who collapses immediately upon hearing a counter-argument. The "proof" is probabilistic rather than absolute, and the journalist’s instant capitulation creates a low-resistance ending that lacks earned tension or closure weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively mirroring Eleanor’s detachment through the "solid floor of cumulus clouds" and the silence. Specific sensory details, like the cedar smell of the pen and the wind buffeting the glass, ground the abstract intellectual conflict in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Stakes are declared but never truly tested; the antagonist presents no active resistance during the confrontation, resulting in a victory without sacrifice or trade-off. The absence of a "tightening" moment where Eleanor must pay a price to succeed makes the conflict feel frictionless and the outcome inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" concept provides a cohesive thematic frame, though its application to a ledger dispute feels slightly forced and abstract. The resolution ties back to this theme, but without an emotional cost paid by the protagonist, the "shifting of the orbit" reads as an intellectual exercise rather than a resonant change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a polished, slightly archaic tone ("solemn playfulness," "gravitational coherence") that fits the heiress archetype well. The psychic distance remains steady, filtering the world consistently through Eleanor’s detached, logical perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with strong imagery ("voice like tearing paper"), though a few phrases lean slightly purple ("dangerously malleable"). The line-level craft effectively supports the elevated tone, maintaining density and momentum without significant artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Applying mathematical logic and astronomical metaphors to a journalism scandal offers a fresh flavor, but the plot structure remains a standard "competent hero fixes problem" narrative. The lack of emotional risk or subversion of the protagonist's certainty limits the story's ingenuity.</comment>
