<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling focalizer whose transition from fearful observer to active participant is well-motivated by the specific pressures of the silent environment. Her internal conflict between self-preservation and the desire for honesty drives the narrative effectively, though her realization that "secrecy manufactures suspicion" reads slightly more as a thematic assertion than an embodied emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot is tightly constructed around the lens and ticket mechanism, leading to a strong confrontation scene with Eli. However, the resolution feels unearned; the board’s immediate acceptance and the "thawing" of deep institutional mistrust happen too conveniently upon seeing the evidence, lacking the resistance or friction that would make the victory feel genuine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sensory details of the silent conservatory—the whispering stones, the texture of the tickets—create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that functions as a constraint on the characters. The physical props (lens, stubs) are integrated excellently as micro-settings that drive the investigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tension builds effectively through the surveillance and the decoding of the tickets, establishing clear stakes regarding trust and sabotage. The climax offers a meaningful risk (Mara exposing the plan), but the lack of consequences or pushback from the board dampens the felt cost of that choice in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of transparency versus suspicion is woven organically into the mechanics of the story (the lens, the hidden layers on tickets). The final image of the tickets and lens laid out like stones is a resonant conceptual repricing of the initial "crushed crystal" forecourt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining the "hushed" quality appropriate for the setting without losing momentum. The shift in perspective from isolation to connection is mirrored well in the tone, though the ending leans slightly into summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and lyrical, with high information density in the descriptions of the tickets and the lens. There are minor instances of "writerly" abstraction (e.g., "borrowed from breath," "ambiguously clear") that distance the reader slightly from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a post-verbal musical society communicating through ticket doodles is inventive and fresh. While the "hidden message revealed by a lens" trope is familiar, its specific application here to deaf accessibility and institutional silence adds a layer of genuine ingenuity.</comment>
