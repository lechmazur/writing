<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific sensory condition ("turns sound into touch") is not merely ornamental but drives their interaction with the world and the central conflict. The shift from passive collection to active preservation ("whispered the rescued names") is a distinct micro-choice that earns the final state of being a "vessel." The emotional cost is palpable in the "grain" of weight added to their erased history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc moves cleanly from an accumulative mode (collecting fragments) to a causal investigation triggered by the label, landing on a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. The discovery of the files provides a concrete focus for the closure, satisfying the setup without resolving the unresolvable (his own death). The pacing is tight, though the "woman in a neon vest" providing the key clue is a slightly convenient bridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the "rhythm of tides" dictates access to the truth (Container 9H) and shapes the protagonist's movement. The sensory details ("smelled of kelp," "shouted order struck me like burlap") are filtered strictly through the POV's unique perception, creating a cohesive atmospheric logic that supports the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (memory vs. erasure) is clear, and the discovery of the label effectively raises the pressure from existential to tangible. While the investigation phase is brief—a single conversation provides the necessary link—the final action of hiding the files represents a meaningful trade-off, accepting the burden of memory to defy the system.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of erasure is explored through concrete particulars (files, labels, ration coupons) rather than abstraction. The "Memory Solvent" literalizes the metaphor without breaking the tone, and the ending—where the protagonist becomes a living archive—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of invisibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident and texturally distinct, maintaining the synesthetic logic ("words hit me as dry sand") without slipping into confusion. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to the protagonist's altered reality while delivering clear exposition about the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and propulsive, with strong verb choices ("record hardened," "name slid off"). The imagery is consistent with the established voice (tactile sound), and there are no visible loops or scaffold artifacts. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the tidal pacing of the plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "port for erased lives" with the specific sensory condition creates a fresh narrative angle. While the "solvent" is a somewhat traditional plot device, its integration into the setting (rerouted shipments, stripped manifests) feels organic to this specific world logic.</comment>
