<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, but her internal landscape is often summarized ("nervously confident") rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs. While she is proactive in solving the puzzle, she faces no genuine character-level dilemma; her victory is total and lacks the psychological cost or transformation required for higher bands. The protagonist functions more as a vehicle for the scavenger hunt than a fully realized agent under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on "lock-and-key" plotting, where progress is determined by finding physical tokens rather than causal decision-making. The resolution hinges on a "soft reset" exposition dump where the antagonist voluntarily explains the entire backstory because a prop (the nail) is presented. Closure is achieved, but it fails the cost proof test—Mara restores the name without paying a visible price, resulting in unearned symmetric satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "air tasting of rust" and the "wind drummed wetly" effectively ground the speculative premise. The physical orientation of the station and the cliff is clear, though the specific mechanics of the "lock shaped like a coffin seam" strain credibility within the otherwise grounded setting. The setting actively participates in the inciting incident (exposing the sandbars), fulfilling the interaction requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The conflict is linear and lacks genuine opposition; Dr. Sato watches but does not impede, and he capitulates immediately upon seeing the nail. There is no escalation of stakes—Mara is never at risk of failing, losing her career, or facing physical danger. The narrative lacks a tightening of pressure, resulting in a low-tension procedural rather than a dramatic arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of "Reversible Exile" is compelling, but the thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("realized the experiment was not just about weather but about memory"). The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing the subtext of the coffin and the archive to carry the weight. The resolution is too tidy, resolving the complex theme of erasure with a simple database correction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and reasonably polished, maintaining a cohesive third-person limited perspective. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("throat full of nervously confident plans") that distances the reader from immediate sensation. The voice effectively manages the transition between the technical (charts, GIS) and the atmospheric.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is generally competent, but marred by logical artifacts like the "slot shaped like a coffin seam"—a physically incoherent image that serves only the plot. Some metaphors feel strained ("rain that seemed to soak straight into thought"), and the final paragraph leans on summary to rush the conclusion. Rhythm is functional but lacks the propulsion expected at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise of "Reversible Exile" linked to climate shifts is imaginative and offers a fresh angle on the "buried secret" trope. However, the execution falls back on standard adventure-game mechanics (find map -> find key -> unlock door) that feel derivative. The potential for a unique story about climate and memory is largely bypassed for a linear mystery solution.</comment>
