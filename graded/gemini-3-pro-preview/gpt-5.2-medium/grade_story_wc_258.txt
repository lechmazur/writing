<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are sharply defined; Aurel’s shame regarding his past use of the method provides excellent depth. The dynamic moves from guardedness to shared purpose without forcing conflict, and the narrator’s specific trait of being "steadily curious" effectively drives the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative structure works well, moving from the loft’s intimate decoding to the city-wide verification. Closure is distinct and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration), though the street sequence relies on summary rather than dramatized resistance, which slightly softens the structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is cohesive and vivid, with the "rain-beaded skylight" and "onyx ink" creating a distinct textural world. The use of the measuring tape as both tool and constraint anchors the magical realism in tangible action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (reconstruction vs. loss), but the narrative pressure is relatively low; the protagonist encounters little resistance during the investigation. The conflict is primarily intellectual and thematic rather than visceral, which limits escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "reverse engineering" culture rather than prophesying profit is exceptionally well-integrated and resonant. The final image perfectly reweights the premise, though the score is capped by the Q2 global gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, perfectly suiting the "listening hush" of the setting. The transition between the technical explanation and the poetic mapping of the streets is handled seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with memorable imagery ("slang that spread like mold") and strong rhythmic control. The writing is polished and evocative without falling into purple prose, though the score is capped by the Q2 global gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptocurrency collapse with cartomancy and architectural magic is fresh and innovative. The concept of "measuring the room inside the people" offers a unique lens on post-crisis recovery.</comment>
