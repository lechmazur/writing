<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora is a highly capable protagonist whose internal conflict—suppressing chaos versus allowing a necessary warning—drives the narrative. Her agency is distinct; rather than reacting passively to the prophecy, she actively modifies her tactics (hush to filter) to solve the dilemma. The resolution earns its weight by shifting her burden from a magical secret-keeper to a public truth-teller, a clear and costly evolution of stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight Causal drive, moving efficiently from the inciting attempt to hush the brook, to the complication of the poison warning, and finally to the synthesis of the "third path." Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the immediate threat is neutralized, but the conceptual price—Liora’s responsibility to speak the truth plainly—lands with weight. The pacing manages the transition from magical operation to moral resolution seamlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the brook acts as the antagonist/messenger, and the "terrestrially cosmic" stones serve the resolution. Sensory details like the "cricket calls" and "wet lines" ground the magical abstraction in tactile reality. The environment actively constrains and shapes the magic system, fulfilling the criteria for high-band specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly braided: the macro political threat (firestorm) versus the immediate humanitarian threat (poisoned wells). The escalation is handled well within the short scope, forcing Liora into a binary choice that she cleverly subverts. The cost is felt in the loss of her anonymity and the consumption of her single charm, grounding the magical solution in resource management.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "secrets as mercy" versus "truth as danger" is woven coherently through the mechanics of the magic system. The ending resonates by inverting the protagonist's initial goal—she begins by silencing and ends resolved to speak. This thematic pivot feels earned and avoids heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the "summoner" archetype without slipping into purple excess. The control of psychic distance is precise, keeping the reader close to Liora’s technical perception of the magic ("feeling the data of it") while managing the broader atmospheric scope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density. Phrases like "mapping silence" and "smoothed hush" effectively evoke the magic system. Minor deductions for occasional adjectival density ("soft snowfall of blank petals," "tranquil blaze") which teeter on the edge of overwriting, though they remain legible and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a summoner who manipulates attention and silence rather than spirits is a refreshing, non-obvious synthesis. The "origami wing" drinking the code is a creative, specific image that grounds the abstract "prophecy" trope in a tactile object. The story feels distinct and avoids generic fantasy templates.</comment>
