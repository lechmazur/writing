<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sava is a highly competent protagonist whose specific perceptual skillset drives the narrative. Her motivation is clearly articulated and internalized, leading directly to the resolution. However, her journey is one of linear expertise rather than deep internal conflict or the overcoming of a significant character flaw, which limits the emotional dimensionality of the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, coherent arc from inciting incident to a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo. The transition from physical mapping to inter-species negotiation is handled well, with the ice-reading sequence serving as a strong bridge. The closure lands effectively, establishing a new, stable paradigm for the world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, functioning as both the antagonist's fuel and the protagonist's tool. Sensory details are strictly filtered through Sava’s auditory/tactile perspective ("drank vibration," "hammered repose"), creating a vivid, immersive physical reality that constrains and shapes every action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The external stakes are clear and urgent, escalating appropriately as the panic feeds the energy beings. The pivot from combat/avoidance to sanctuary offers a satisfying thematic deepening. A more palpable personal cost to Sava—beyond the exertion of the ritual—would have sharpened the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transforming noise into harmony and enemies into refugees is woven tightly into the mechanics of the magic system. The ending resonates without becoming didactic, allowing the "bloom of hush" to serve as both a physical safety mechanism and a metaphor for empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical register that suits the mythic tone of the piece. The focus on acoustics and vibration permeates the diction ("resonance," "chorus," "echo"), creating a unified perceptual signature for the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Images like "fractures recorded pressures the way ink recorded words" demonstrate strong command of metaphor. Rhythm varies effectively to match the tension of the scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The specific mechanics of the "ripple-mark mapkeeper" and "echo chamber stone" offer a fresh take on the negotiator-archetype story. While the "misunderstood alien refugee" trope is familiar, the execution through sound-based geology feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
