<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; Iri's specific skill (peripheral awareness) integrates perfectly with her worldview and choices. The Prophet is complex, balancing charisma with a genuine fear of his own power ("rot into command"), creating a dynamic duality. Their interaction drives the narrative arc through a shared, earned vulnerability rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is tight and seamless; the Prophet's arrival disturbs the wall, necessitating the ritual which serves as the climax. Closure is a sophisticated Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of "prophecy" and "protection" is reframed through their shared risk. The pacing manages a complete arc within a short word count without rushing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting acts as an active antagonist and judge; the "kinetic parapet" constrains movement and demands a specific "measured kindness." Sensory details like "whisperfield calm" and "stitched linen" are vivid and atmospherically consistent. The environment is not just a backdrop but the mechanic through which the resolution is achieved.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are both conceptual (wisdom vs. command) and physical (the twitching wall), creating a coherent pressure that escalates when Iri offers the bargain. The conflict is resolved through agency and mutual risk-taking. The tightening of tension during the ritual is palpable and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "preserving wisdom without owning it" is woven into the narrative mechanics (the echo chamber) rather than stated as a moral. The Prophet's admission of doubt as a "stone set true" serves as a profound, non-literal resolution to the thematic question. Subtext regarding power and humility is handled with precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the mythic/sci-fantasy tone. The POV remains tightly anchored in Iri’s perception ("paced... like a thought"), filtering the world through her unique lens of "attention and disregard." The tone modulates effectively from suspicion to shared reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("meaning gather like dew," "ribs under skin"), maintaining a high level of craft. A handful of filter verbs ("Iri saw," "Iri felt," "Iri recognized") slightly distance the reader in moments that could be more immediate, preventing a perfect score, but the imagery is otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of "line walker" mechanics with a "kinetic echo chamber" offers a genuinely fresh take on fantasy tropes. The concept of a wall that reacts to truth/doubt feels innovative and specific to this world. The story takes a bold risk with its quiet, internal climax and succeeds.</comment>
