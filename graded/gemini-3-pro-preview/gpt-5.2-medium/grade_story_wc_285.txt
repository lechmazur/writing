<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rowan is a compelling protagonist whose internal grief is expertly externalized through his trade tools (needle, reins). His motivation is singular and drives the plot; he actively forces the climax by refusing to drive until the truth is spoken. The interaction with Senn reveals deep status dynamics, shifting from servant/master to creditor/debtor with tangible tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the "ticking gutters" as an effective countdown that forces the inciting incident into a crisis. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration: the return of Mara and the rewriting of the debt change the status quo irrevocably. The causality is clean, driven by the protagonist's specific skill set.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the conflict; the fog, the river, and the bridgehouse create a claustrophobic crucible that forces the confession. Sensory details like "scabbed ink," "salt-stiff sleeves," and "lamp halos" are vivid and grounded. The specific mechanics of the bridgehouse (gutters, tea) ground the magical elements in a lived-in reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally as the environmental timer (gutters) runs down. The conflict between Senn's desire for secrecy and Rowan's demand for truth is sharp. The resolution feels earned through Rowan's agency, though the magical return of Mara is a swift reward; the cost is paid primarily by Senn (his office/pride), which fits the fable logic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "palimpsest promises" is woven beautifully through the plot mechanics and the physical prop. However, the final paragraph contains an explicit thematic summary ("understood that promises, like palimpsests, were never erased but clarified") which acts as a slight "moral of the story" artifact, replacing the resonance of the final image with explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, blending folklore lyricism with a noir-like grit ("ink scabbed and scraped"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Rowan’s perception, filtering the world through his specific grief and expertise. The narrative distance is controlled perfectly to maintain suspense while revealing interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density. The integration of required phrases is mostly smooth, though the grammatical awkwardness of "until rain gutters stop ticking" (mandated phrase) creates a slight rhythmic hitch. No significant loops or scaffold artifacts; the writing is polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central concept of a "palimpsest promise" as a magical binding that can be physically excavated with a needle is highly original and imaginative. Transforming a standard ferryman/debt trope into a story about textual archaeology and grief feels fresh and specific. The synthesis of elements is seamless.</comment>
