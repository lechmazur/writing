<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's "luminous skeptic" persona is not merely a label but drives the central inquiry and the final theft. The skepticism translates into concrete actions—bypassing filters, analyzing the footprints—rather than just attitude. The internal tension between the lure of "homecoming" and the rigorous need for "chemistry" is resolved through a specific, earned disillusionment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with exceptional precision; the chemical lock puzzle (terpenes + crystals) is a tight causal pivot that recontextualizes the premise from spiritual return to biological sampling. The final theft is a decisive change earned by the protagonist's specific skills. The drive lens (Causal/Investigative) holds flawlessly from the initial hypothesis to the final evidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is functional and atmospheric; the "rainwashed" condition is not just a backdrop but a mechanical necessity for the crystals "feeding on humidity." The "fly amber" and "bronze" create a cohesive, tactile palette that grounds the sci-fi concepts in specific, earthy textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are intellectual but visceral, escalated by the physical effect of the unfiltered signal ("teeth ache"). The conflict between the Council's script and the protagonist's curiosity forces a clear divergence in tactics. The cost is a conceptual loss—the destruction of the nostalgic myth of homecoming—paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic turn from "homecoming" to "sampling" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central mystery. The story effectively critiques the human desire for meaning (nostalgia) by revealing a colder, biological reality, yet the protagonist's response (theft) reclaims agency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinct "scientific poetic" register ("pattern too patient for weather") that fits the biochemist persona perfectly. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing the reader to discover the mechanism alongside the protagonist without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density ("stones shone like cooled bronze"). Imagery serves the plot; the description of the "microcrystals arranged like tiny ladders" acts as both atmosphere and evidence. No drag or artifacts detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of first contact as a chemical catalyst/tuning mechanism rather than communication is a fresh, specific synthesis. The "Pilgrim Salt" and the use of personal scent/chemistry as a key transforms familiar tropes (the tower, the signal) into something novel and logically consistent.</comment>
