<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's internal struggle culminates in a decisive on-page choice to sacrifice her most treasured possession, creating a visible cost that earns the resolution. Her motivation is grounded in specific history, moving beyond the "shy poet" label to active agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal, leading to a Decisive Change where the armistice is renewed through a necessary sacrifice. The mechanism of the resolution is logically planted, though the pacification of the captains' grandchildren feels slightly accelerated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the shell's acoustics and the cistern's roots constrain the protagonist's actions and charge the final image. Sensory details like "root-hairs like ink" are specific and functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently as the lilies blacken, forcing a trade-off between personal memory (the postcard) and collective survival. The cost is felt, though the external antagonism remains somewhat abstract until the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The explicit articulation of the theme ("Peace is a plant that must be watered with memory...") near the climax flattens the subtext into a moral lesson. This "Thematic Echo" reduces the resonance of an otherwise strong visual resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical texture that suits the protagonist's vocation without sacrificing clarity. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Mara's sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("listening ear," "drinking the blooded sea") driving the momentum. Minor compound-adjective stacking occurs, but the lines generally do double duty for atmosphere and plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of biological magic (metabolic armistice) with the epistolary element creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The central metaphor of photosynthesis applied to diplomacy feels inventive and well-integrated.</comment>
