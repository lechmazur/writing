<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The somatic nature of the character's interiority ("joints report angle like a confession") is brilliant, grounding the high-concept premise in visceral experience. The final psychological pivot is earned by this specific embodiment of trauma, satisfying the 9+ standard for contradictory impulses resolved with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is strong—a Conceptual Repricing of "mercy" that propels the protagonist back to dawn with a defined purpose. The "forest as archive" logic holds the causality together, though the arrival of the clearing feels slightly convenient compared to the rigorous setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active, functioning as both antagonist and tool ("spikes of fear mark a coordinate") rather than static backdrop. The ultraviolet imagery is vivid, specific, and thematically consistent, directly constraining the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high; the search for the "mathematics of mercy" creates excellent accumulation of pressure. The climax forces a tangible physiological cost (reading the equation through pain), though the external antagonism of the tribunal remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The thematic conclusion—mercy as a release for the victim rather than absolution for the perpetrator—is profound and arises organically from the mechanics of the story. The "mathematics" metaphor lands with genuine resonance rather than reductionism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is clinically poetic, perfectly suiting a "rebuilt" survivor analyzing their own pain. It falters only slightly when navigating specific required phrases, but the distinctive perceptual signature remains intact throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally dense and evocative ("bruise that gives light"), but the verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "remembering through trauma responses" creates a visible scaffold artifact. This repetition disrupts the otherwise seamless rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of torture rehabilitation, biomechanical enhancement, and mathematical magic. The concept of "ultraviolet penance" is fresh, and the execution avoids clichés associated with interrogation stories.</comment>
