<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mina’s transition from a passive "noticer" to an active participant is elevated by the confession of her signed complaint, which adds essential moral complexity and culpability. The internal conflict is embodied, and the "creeping normality" trait drives her choices organically rather than just serving as a label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure lands with precision; the final image of the sprout serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration that physically manifests the "tenuous absolution." The causal link between the risk of planting and the result is earned, with the cost of Mina's safety and shame clearly felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "secret tea house" and "overgrown courtyard" are vivid, with specific details like the "broken marble" hiding planters directly constraining the characters' tactics. The environment is not just a backdrop but a tool for the resistance, though the "glass towers" are a somewhat generic contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conflict tightens effectively when the bread—a static relic of grief—is transformed into an active offering, raising the stakes from observation to participation. The pressure is coherent, moving from the internal pain of erasure to the external risk of the "patrols."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "memory as edible" and "small green arguments against forgetting" is integrated seamlessly into the action without didacticism. The concept of "tenuous absolution" provides a nuanced, non-binary resolution to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a melancholic, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The phrase "heuristically gentle," while descriptive, creates a slight register clash, introducing a clinical tone that momentarily disrupts the established mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative ("lantern light trembling," "proof that memory could be edible"), but the opening paragraph relies on static summary and state-of-being verbs ("was," "had shifted"). This scaffolded setup slightly delays the immediacy of the active scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of "relic bread" and "guerrilla gardening" offers a fresh, specific angle on the surveillance-state resistance trope. The focus on personal atonement through "tenuous absolution" distinguishes the narrative from standard heroic resistance stories.</comment>
