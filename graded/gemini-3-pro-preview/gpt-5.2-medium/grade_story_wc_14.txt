<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Haru is a compelling, specific focalizer whose motivation to "collect textures" drives the narrative. His interiority is lush and consistent, though the emotional cost of his "incandescent restraint" feels slightly muted compared to the intellectual rigor of his method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, moving from the shop to the mountain to deepen the central metaphor. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of the silence, effectively shifting the protagonist's stance from mourning to artistic preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "bonsai oak split by lightning" specifically constrains and charges the final realization (the scar as a pause), meeting the high-band standard for environmental integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, which fits the quiet tone but lowers immediate pressure. The escalation is a deepening of perception rather than a narrowing of tactical options, effective under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of invented history vs. silence resonates powerfully without becoming didactic. The ending recontextualizes the central premise ("not as loss but as a pause") with earned thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is precise and lyrical, matching the "stationer" persona perfectly. However, a significant repetition glitch in the climax damages the sense of control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the prose is generally evocative, a severe editing artifact in paragraph 17 ("At dawn he charted it again, by charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn as he always did") creates a disruptive loop during a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gilded-leaf stationer, a silent town, and sound-wave history is highly original and executed with freshness. The concept feels distinct and avoids standard post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
