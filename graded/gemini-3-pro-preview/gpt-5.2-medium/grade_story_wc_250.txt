<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Guardian's motivation of "silent empathy" is dramatized effectively through action rather than dialogue. The Girl's internal state is vivid, though her "half-spoken secret" feels slightly archetypal. The interaction is compelling, though the emotional weight relies heavily on the lyrical framing rather than raw character friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is distinct and creative, using the setting's mechanics (shutters/light) to drive the resolution. Closure is decisive with a clear change in the status quo (body revealed, help summoned). The narrative logic holds together well within the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting; the shutters and canal are not just backdrop but the primary tools of resolution. The environment constrains and enables the protagonist's choices, turning the architecture itself into a character. This meets the high-band criteria for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and high (a hidden murder, a grieving son), and the tension escalates effectively through the manipulation of light and darkness. The "watchman lantern" blinking back provides a satisfying, concrete release of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of revealing truth through light is resonant, but the narration occasionally tells rather than shows ("teach darkness the value of stars"). This explicit thematic summarization in the narrative voice slightly flattens the subtextual power of the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The POV drifts between the Guardian's internal state and the Girl's direct visual perception ("she saw weeds"), creating a slight head-hopping effect that dilutes the focal anchor. While the voice is consistent in tone, the perspective management lacks the discipline required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from simile density ("like a bruised coin," "like a staircase," "like silt," "like a lid," "like a loom"), which creates a repetitive syntactic rhythm. "Spiralingly calm" is an awkward construction that clashes with the otherwise sharp imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central conceit—using dock shutters to weave starlight into a searchlight—is highly original and visually arresting. The synthesis of noir elements with a fable-like tone creates a fresh, memorable atmosphere.</comment>
