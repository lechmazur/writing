<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rook's specific internal state (jittery, keeping boots on) is established early, but his agency falters in the middle beat where the pendant, not his action, solves the lamplighter's disconnection. He reclaims agency at the closure by writing the question, but the characterization feels slightly passive during the rising action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The structure leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing of the delivery task, effectively shifting from possession to planting. However, the climax relies on Mara's sudden decision to abandon her purchased relic, which feels driven more by the story's thematic needs than by hard-earned causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and active, physically leaning in to mirror the time dilation. The setting successfully constrains the encounter to a narrow, high-stakes geography that enhances the isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and thematic; the external stakes (mistakes, jitters) do not manifest as acute obstacles in the scene. The resolution is gentle and cooperative, lacking a moment of high-cost friction or difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of attention and myth-making is beautifully realized, culminating in a final image that resonates beyond the plot. The shift from delivering an object to asking a question ("What did you notice today?") offers a profound, non-literal answer to the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and suits the fable-like quality of the tale. Perspective stays firmly with Rook, though the explanation of the pendant's mechanics feels slightly like an authorial intrusion rather than embodied perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense ("ribbon of frozen scree"), but the mechanical explanation of the magic ("by vibrating sympathetically") drags on the momentum. A few transition points rely on linear "and then" sequencing rather than causal propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the prompt elements into a cohesive, charming fable with a thoughtful ending. While the "magical courier" setup is familiar, the conceptual turn at the end—valuing the question over the object—adds distinct freshness.</comment>
