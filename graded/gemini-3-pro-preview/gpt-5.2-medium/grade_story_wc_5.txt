<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eira is a distinct, stylized presence who fits the fable-like tone, but her motivation ("translate heartbeats into maps") feels more like a thematic conceit than a grounded psychological drive. While her ritual actions are clear, the "trust not numbers" trait reads as a slightly clichéd setup for the story's central dichotomy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building through ritual steps to a resonant closure where the map is shared. The arrival of the cartographer provides a necessary external beat to ground the ending, though the "cost" of the closure is largely symbolic rather than strictly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("sketched in ash," "branches fixed mid-shiver") that creates a tangible atmosphere. The environment actively participates in the ritual, functioning as both a resource for materials and a constraint on the protagonist's movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is primarily man-against-entropy, lacking urgent external opposition; the "roaming surveyors" are a mentioned threat that never materializes to force a choice. The tension relies entirely on the success of the ritual, which, while atmospheric, lacks the sharp pressure of a tightening dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving the intangible in a quantifying world is coherent and woven through every action. The motifs of "breath" and "heartbeat" are effective but border on heavy-handedness, repeating frequently enough to feel slightly imposed rather than emerging organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, elevated, and consistent, perfectly suiting the mythic/sci-fi blend. The control over lyricism prevents the prose from becoming purple, maintaining a "moving stillness" that mirrors the story's intended tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished and dense with high-quality imagery ("stars bit into the surface like teeth"). The rhythm is well-managed, though there is a slight tendency toward noun-phrase clusters ("spiral of spoons around a lens-eye") that slows the pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of flash-paper photography, alchemy, and cartography creates a fresh, specific magic system. The core concept of mapping heartbeats via refuse constellations is inventive and elevates the familiar "dying world" trope.</comment>
