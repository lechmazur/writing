<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rowan is a compelling protagonist whose specific professional expertise (bone setting) drives his interaction with the supernatural. The shift from skepticism to responsibility is earned through tactile, character-specific action (setting the jaw) rather than abstract thought. His internal state is complex, balancing grief with a clinical eye.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative structure is loose for this length, relying on travel summaries (Garden → River → Garden) that dissipate scenic tension. The realization at the riverbank feels like it should have been integrated into the initial garden scene or memory to maintain a tighter, single-shard container. Closure is strong, but the bridge to get there relies on convenient transit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden is rendered with sharp, sensory specificity ("clipped walls of yew," "swollen from rain") that grounds the magical elements. The contrast between the weathered sundials and the electric pump effectively mirrors the tension between folklore and modern skepticism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central conflict—skepticism versus evidence of the impossible—escalates clearly and resolves through active agency. The climax (treating the changeling) is a distinct high-pressure beat that forces Rowan to abandon his safe worldview for a dangerous truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "navigating by what we get wrong" is brilliantly integrated through the medical notebook and the constellation metaphor. This concept resonates powerfully at the end without feeling tacked on; it recasts the entire investigation as a form of celestial navigation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, blending clinical precision with lyrical observation ("cleft in certainty," "misaligned hinge"). The tone remains consistent, managing the transition from mystery to fantasy without losing its grounded, melancholic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative, with high-quality line work. There is a slight reliance on summary in the middle section ("He went back to the riverbank at dusk...") which flattens the momentum compared to the scenic beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of orthopedic medicine and changeling folklore is exceptionally fresh. Treating a fairy-tale substitution as a medical anomaly to be diagnosed and treated is a unique angle that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
