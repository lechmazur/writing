<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc from hoarding silence to releasing it is poignant and well-motivated by the sister's arrival. The shift is earned through specific observation and memory, though the self-definition as "astonished recluse" feels slightly expository initially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "tangled covenant" is untied through a concrete ritual. The narrative drive is clear, utilizing the sister’s appearance as a decisive causal trigger that leads directly to the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the "scorched wasteland" and "cracked hives" constrain the protagonist's life and mirror the internal state. The sensory details of ash, wax, and the dry spring are vivid and purposeful, grounding the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conflict between preserving the "weight of unspoken words" and the need for release provides a strong emotional stake. The escalation is quiet but effective, moving from general haunting to the specific, high-pressure confrontation with Mara.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief and release is resonant, though the explicit statement ("The valley did not need my hoarding...") and the final note ("I forgive you for surviving") border on moralizing, slightly reducing the power of the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct ("mute eloquence"), fitting the atmospheric premise perfectly. The required phrase "contextual clues" creates a minor register slip against the mythic tone, but the narrator's control remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong rhythm and imagery ("ash that settled on my tongue like vows"). The repetition of the phrase "contextual clues" creates a slight mechanical artifact, and the explicit thematic sentence in the latter half slows the momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping imagery with a ghost story about unspoken words is fresh and compelling. The "stained glass box" as a vessel for silence is an original and effective conceit that anchors the emotional logic.</comment>
