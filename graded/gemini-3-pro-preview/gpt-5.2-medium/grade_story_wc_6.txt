<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The protagonist relies on superhero-level competence (performing a skin graft in a burning building) that defies professional reality and breaks character grounding. Interiority is dominated by thematic self-analysis ("practiced unyielding compassion") rather than organic, embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>A severe "False Expertise" failure occurs when the protagonist performs a surgical skin graft during a structure fire, shattering suspension of disbelief. The late introduction of the copycat plot pivots the story away from the rescue arc, creating a disjointed episodic structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic beach provide a vivid, consistent backdrop that grounds the action. However, the "migration of clouds" functions as a vague poetic bookend rather than a specific atmospheric pressure that influences the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate artificially through the medically implausible procedure rather than earned tactical choices. The conflict resolves via a passive symbolic gesture regarding a copycat who was not part of the narrative drive until the epilogue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit "telling" and moralizing dialogue ("scars can sing") rather than subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the thesis ("answer burning with saving"), removing interpretive space and triggering the thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but overly elevated, prioritizing poetic sentiment over the gritty reality of the setting. It leans into melodrama ("smelled... of grief") that distances the reader from the immediate physical crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished but suffers from "purple" abstraction and mixed metaphors ("grafted into light"). The text relies on stated emotions rather than evoked sensations, reducing the impact of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core concept relies on familiar tropes (arsonist’s daughter) without subverting them. The central innovation—the field graft—undermines the story’s grounding rather than enhancing its distinctiveness.</comment>
