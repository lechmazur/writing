<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lio is a distinct, sympathetic focalizer, but his interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("wanted to find strength in vulnerability," "act of naming hurt"). This over-articulation distances the reader from the embodied experience of his grief, telling us how he categorizes his emotions rather than letting them play out in subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a massive coincidence—meteors physically aligning to point like fingers at a hidden tunnel—to drive the plot. This mystical convergence resolves the search without character agency, functioning as a deus ex machina that undermines the grounded, mechanical setup of the station.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospherically dense, with details like "generators ticking like bones" and the "basalt ridge" creating a tangible sense of isolation. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, and the "yellow lantern glass" serves as an excellent micro-setting element that filters perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The internal stakes of processing grief are clear, and the shift from isolation to communal mourning provides a legible cost (the loss of protective solitude). However, the external escalation is weak, relying on the convenient meteor anomaly rather than active investigation or pressure to force the discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext. Phrases like "vulnerability stopped feeling like failure" and the final summary "found a way to stand within its breaking" reduce the story's resonance to a stated thesis, violating the show-don't-tell principle for theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and meditative, suiting the "cosmic janitor" persona well. It occasionally slips into a "helpful narrator" mode that explains the emotional significance of actions (e.g., "knowing it was the body's honest salute to loss") instead of trusting the imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished with strong rhythm and memorable imagery ("barnacle on the night"). There is a slight tendency toward compound sentence structures ("He [verb]... and [verb]...") that creates a repetitive cadence, but the line-level craft is generally high quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the concept of a janitor finding meaning in meteor tracks is poetic, the execution relies on the familiar trope of a predecessor's logbook mirroring the protagonist's exact struggle. The "meteors pointing the way" element pushes the story into fantasy territory, clashing with the established sci-fi/literary tone.</comment>
