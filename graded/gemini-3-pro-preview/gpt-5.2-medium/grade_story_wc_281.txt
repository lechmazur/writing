<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, proactive protagonist whose "affectionate skeptic" trait is not merely labeled but operationalized in the climax (hugging the lawyer to disarm a threat). Her motivation to prioritize people over dogmas drives the plot logically from the studio test to the public exhibit. The internal shift from skepticism to advocacy feels earned through the empirical evidence she gathers, though her internal conflict is resolved somewhat quickly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving efficiently from the inciting incident (Jory's arrival) to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the closure (symptoms recontextualized as a map). The leap from a studio light test to successfully locating a specific "sealed service tunnel" is slightly convenient, compressing the investigation phase, but the causal chain remains unbroken. The closure—refusing the buyout to offer an open protocol—lands with clear ethical cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details are specific and evocative, effectively grounding the speculative elements; the "ozone" smell and "anxious tongue" of the grid set a strong post-disaster mood. The studio environment is utilized well as a tool for discovery, not just a backdrop. The "muscovite geode" provides excellent tactile specificity that anchors the light painting mechanic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (mental autonomy vs. corporate erasure), and the discovery of the generator proves the value of the "glitch." However, the antagonist pressure (recall agents) is resolved relatively easily with "coffee" and a "hug," which softens the external threat. The escalation relies more on the wonder of discovery than increasing peril, though the final refusal adds necessary weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a resonant synthesis of trauma and recovery, framing the "damage" from the pills as a necessary new sense for a broken world. The theme of "shortcuts between panic and care" is beautifully realized in the final image of the map. The subtext regarding corporate negligence versus community resilience is handled with sophistication, avoiding preachy exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mara's artistic perception. The prose rhythm matches the light-painting subject matter—fluid and visual. While generally controlled, a few moments of diction ("doubted miracles second") feel slightly rehearsed, but the overall distinctness of the POV is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and vivid, with strong imagery like the "lattice of light." However, the phrase "fractures that looked fractally precise" creates an awkward root-word repetition (fracture/fractal) that disrupts the rhythm. Additionally, the final phrase "willowglass hope" leans slightly toward purple prose, though the sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—using long-exposure light painting and geodes to visualize somatic markers as a navigation map—is highly original and brilliantly executed. The story transforms the familiar "drug recall" trope into a fresh narrative about sensory adaptation and art as a diagnostic tool. The synthesis of technical photography and psychic phenomena feels unique and inevitable.</comment>
