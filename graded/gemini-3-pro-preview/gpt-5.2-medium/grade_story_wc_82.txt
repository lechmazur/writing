<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and poetic, but her internal struggle is handled through summary rather than dramatized hesitation. The choice to split herself feels inevitable rather than weighed, reducing the felt cost of the sacrifice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on compressed summary for the first half ("She has spent months..."), reading more like a prologue than an immediate scene. While the closure logic holds, the lack of a fully dramatized approach reduces the causal grip of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and inventive ("ropes of jasmine scent," "ink fish"), effectively grounding the surreal fable. The environment actively shapes the mood, though the tea garden's mechanics are slightly elided.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are established, but the protagonist meets obstacles with immediate competence and acceptance, lacking a moment of doubt or desperate improvisation. The "price" is paid without a visible struggle or hesitation, lowering the tension of the final trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief is powerful, but the ending explicitly states the moral ("made useful, so other mourners..."). This didactic summary flattens the resonance of the final image, resolving the complexity too neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and polished, perfectly suiting the magical realism genre. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining a fable-like quality without becoming detached or confusing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("bite light cleanly," "stained dawn"), with strong rhythm and no wasted words. The figurative language supports the magical atmosphere without obscuring clarity or falling into purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination of origami, dream recording, and detached shadows creates a fresh, cohesive mythology. The "flame and paper" split is an imaginative, genre-appropriate resolution that feels distinct.</comment>
