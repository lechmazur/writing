<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eren's grief and physical struggle are grounded well in the unique premise, establishing strong motivation. However, his pivotal transformation relies on an external validation (the message in the rocks) rather than an earned internal shift, making the resolution feel slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story breaks its own rigorous "frictionless" logic at the climax by introducing an unexplained magical parting of the sea ("lift like a door"), which disconnects the solution from the established physics. Additionally, the temporal causality of Lysa's rocks finishing Eren's present-day sequence is muddy and convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sensory details of the frictionless world—skaters on dry stone, silent sheets of water, the rope harness—are vivid and consistently constrain the character's movement. The setting effectively pressures the action and grounds the high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established through Eren's isolation and the physical danger of the bluff. While the pressure escalates with Marel's arrival, the resolution relies on a miraculous event (the sea opening/ghost message) that solves the conflict without requiring a sufficient sacrifice of Eren's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The thematic resonance collapses when the dust literally spells out the word "Forgive," reducing a complex emotional arc to a didactic instruction. This lack of ambiguity and reliance on explicit text kills the subtext of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, suiting the lyrical tone of the piece. The perspective stays close to Eren, though phrases like "precognitive torment" lean slightly into telling rather than dramatizing the experience of the curse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with evocative imagery like "silent sheets" and "borrowed dawn" creating a cohesive mood. The prose flows well, though the description of the dust forming a legible word strains visual credibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a frictionless world is imaginative and handled with fresh, specific details (eel herding, harnesses). However, the "message from beyond" ending is a familiar trope that detracts from the ingenuity of the setup.</comment>
