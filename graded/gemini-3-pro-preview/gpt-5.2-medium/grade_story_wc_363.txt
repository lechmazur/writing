<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Yara serves effectively as a fable archetype, and her choice to sacrifice her voice is poignant. However, the narrative relies heavily on summary ("Night after night") rather than dramatized scenes, which distances the reader from her interior struggle and makes the realization of the cost feel observed rather than viscerally experienced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story follows a clean fable structure with a distinct beginning, middle, and end, and the closure—Jun's return at the cost of Yara's voice—is resonant. The logic of the puzzle-map operates well within the magical realist frame, though the reliance on sequential summary ("Weeks later") flattens the narrative arc's tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric specificity ("bamboo culms," "salt crust," "soot"), grounding the magical elements in tactile reality. The environment actively participates in the tone, with the silence of the orchard serving as both atmosphere and antagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and the cost—permanent silence—is legible and paid on the page. While the escalation is summarized rather than dramatized in real-time scenes, the trade-off between the message and the spinner's voice creates a coherent pressure that resolves meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of sacrifice for connection is handled with grace, and the final image of teaching the brother to weave effectively reconfigures the premise of the "quiet duty." The resonance is slightly diminished by the mechanical repetition of the "time's unraveling tapestry" phrase, which feels inserted rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent fable-like quality, but is capped due to significant line-level artifacts (see Q7). The tonal control is generally good, though some phrasing feels slightly purple or forced to accommodate required elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant artifacts, specifically the verbatim repetition of the long phrase "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" in such a short text, which reads like a mechanical insertion. Additionally, the reliance on summary telling ("She understood then," "realizing the latent sacrifice") reduces immediacy and impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of jigsaw puzzle edges as a loom's border to map a coastline is a fresh and ingenious concept. While the execution leans on standard fable tropes, the specific mechanics of the weaving and the puzzle map offer a distinct and memorable image.</comment>
