<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire for "stories in scars" drives the narrative effectively, but her physical capacity to tunnel through stone foundation immediately post-surgery contradicts her established vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change and felt cost, but the inciting logic (anesthesia telepathy) is convenient and the tunneling sequence (bread knife vs. stone) breaks physical causality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the physical cost of reopening the wound serves as a strong escalation, though the lack of external opposition flattens the mid-scene tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of "scars as legible script" is resonant, though the story tends to state its thesis explicitly ("closure is not a lid") rather than trusting the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, maintaining a consistent poetic texture, though the expository explanation for the telepathy feels like an intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is evocative but relies heavily on "X like Y" similes (pebble, veins, ink), which creates a repetitive cadence that slightly dilutes the imagery's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of coffee rings and scar-script is imaginative, but the resolution—releasing trapped light to heal a sick city—leans on familiar genre tropes.</comment>
