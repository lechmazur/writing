<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maris is a distinct, consistent focalizer, but Tarek’s rapid transformation from hardened bounty hunter to pacifist planter feels slightly idealized. His "softening" upon entering the dome and his susceptibility to the talisman border on magical rather than psychological, bypassing the grit of genuine internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story builds a strong situational frame but falters at the climax with a "soft reset" resolution. The militia's retreat—driven merely by a speech and "unsettled" feelings about the roses—lacks sufficient causal weight for a paramilitary force pursuing a bounty, making the external victory feel unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest engine; the "moral botany" of roses that respond to aggression is a brilliant, constraint-generating invention. The glass dome functions effectively as both atmosphere and a mechanism that physically enforces the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates well with the arrival of the father and the militia trucks, but the release valve is too loose. The external threat dissolves without a commensurate on-page cost or tactical maneuver, relying on the antagonists simply deciding to leave, which deflates the accumulated tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of continuity and "quiet as a bridge" is woven tightly into the narrative logic and the physical props (talisman, roses). While the ending leans toward the didactic, the integration of theme into the mechanics of the world (bio-feedback plants) saves it from being purely abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and possesses a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the fable-like tone. However, the reliance on high-level labeling (e.g., "senselessly perceptive") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the characters' perceptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("catch the last soot... like dark snow"). It suffers slightly from overwrought phrasing in places ("senselessly perceptive," "reflex hard as leather") that prioritizes poetic sound over precise meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central concept of "pacifist botany"—plants trained to enforce non-violence—is a fresh and ingenious synthesis of solarpunk and western tropes. This risk-taking premise elevates the story above standard post-apocalyptic fare.</comment>
