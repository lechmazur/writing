<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s arc from skepticism to holding "certainty of meaning" is earned through specific sensory interactions with the tile rather than abstract epiphany. Her "courageously kind" trait manifests in costly action (sharing the writing burden) and physical endurance, grounding the magical elements in character reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulation of transcribed squares builds coherent pressure toward the "blank space" resolution, a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration that revalues the silence of grief. The arrival of Leena functions effectively as a pressure-intensifier fitting the established logic, and the closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The open tower acts as a functional constraint, allowing the "salt wind" and whale rhythm to physically interleave with the task and shape the pacing. The final image of whales breaching "as if turning pages" fuses the setting, action, and theme into a singular, charged impression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stake of emotional endurance is clearly signaled and escalated by the shifting, demanding patterns of the tile that force collaboration. The cost is legible in the physical toll of transcription and the "knot" of shared grief Mara accepts, though the conflict remains quiet and internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "deliberate silence" as a valid response to grief is sophisticated and emerges organically from the plot mechanics (the blank space in the chart). It avoids trite resolution, offering a resonant Conceptual Repricing of sorrow that lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined lyrical consistency ("grief like a lantern") that perfectly suits the atmospheric premise without drifting into purple prose. Interiority shifts smoothly between skepticism and sensory immersion, maintaining a stable distance that controls the emotional temperature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic ("prayer flags made of math," "unheard symphony tuning itself") with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. The metaphoric systems (math, music, sea) blend coherently, supporting the magical realist tone without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of magic squares, whale migration, and grief processing creates a unique, non-derivative metaphor that refreshes the genre. The concept of the "math of memory" provides a specific, mechanical grounding to what could otherwise be a vague emotional trope.</comment>
