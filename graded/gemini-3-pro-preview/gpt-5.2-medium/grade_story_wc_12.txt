<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Selo is a distinct, compelling focalizer whose professional toolkit (the loop pedal, rhetoric) deeply informs his worldview and actions. The "priest as rhetorical engineer" concept provides a strong internal logic for his choices. Mara functions primarily as a site of conflict rather than a fully realized agent until the final beat, though her memory of the brother serves as a functional pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and inventive, with Selo's interventions logically dismantling the parasite's hold via established magic rules. The closure is a valid Decisive Change (the drawing of the circle), though its impact is slightly softened by the narrator explicitly explaining the philosophy ("exorcism was less a battle...") rather than letting the image stand alone. The cost remains largely abstract/conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral; the basalt ring and the tactile nature of the sound (loops, vibrations) ground the metaphysical conflict. The artist's palette acts as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains the climax to a single choice. Score capped at 8.8 due to the Q2 global gate (closure requires higher felt cost for 9+).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rhetorical escalation (anaphora to chiasmus to irony) creates a coherent pressure cooker, but the stakes feel more intellectual than physical. The "cost" of the engagement is low; Mara recovers "wholly present" and the rift is soothed without a lasting scar or sacrifice, limiting the emotional weight of the victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of mapping as connection rather than conquest is beautifully woven into the action. However, the score is penalized for a Thematic Echo in the final paragraph, where Selo explicitly articulates the story's thesis ("showing what we assume about power"), turning subtext into text and flattening the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly attuned to the protagonist's mindset ("soft circuits," "drawn map"). The register remains consistent even during high-concept descriptions. The voice successfully carries the density of the metaphor without breaking into purple prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and striking imagery ("air felt like a cloth over a bell"). Syntax mimics the looping nature of the magic without becoming repetitive. Score capped at 8.8 due to the Q2 global gate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of audio engineering, cartography, and exorcism is highly original and executed with serious artistic commitment. The "rhetorical combat" mechanic is a fresh take on spiritual warfare. Score capped at 8.8 due to the Q2 global gate.</comment>
