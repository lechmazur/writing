<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ilian is a superbly realized protagonist whose gentle meticulousness is tested by the crisis. The interplay between his professional detachment and the personal grief for his sister creates a genuine internal conflict, resolved by the active choice to offer his own promise as a stabilizing force. The cost is felt in the final image, where his ledger transforms from a shield into a mirror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise and economical, moving from the disruption of the courier to the resonant reconfiguration of Ilian's worldview. The closure is earned through specific, on-page action (the whispered vow) that reweights the initial premise of the Archive. The drive lens is consistently maintained, blending the situational pressure of the decaying slide with the causal necessity of Ilian's intervention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active constraint; the "quartz hush" and freezing temperatures dictate the pacing and tactile reality of the scene. The Lumen Room's specific mechanics—crystals catching breath, lenses in frost—ground the magical concept in a tangible, quasi-scientific rigor that enhances credibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: the permanent loss of a human soul/promise against the entropy of the world. The escalation is handled well through the degrading signal of the slide, forcing Ilian to abandon passive observation for active participation. The emotional cost—the loss of his safe distance from the archives—is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of preserving meaning against "the unremembering" is woven organically into the plot mechanics rather than stated abstractly. The reconstruction of the vow serves as a powerful metaphor for the archivist's burden, landing a resonant emotional aftereffect without slipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and deeply textured, perfectly matching the protagonist's precise and melancholic worldview. The psychic distance is managed expertly, keeping the reader close to Ilian's perception of the frequencies and the cold without head-hopping or exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and striking imagery like "auroras crawled like slow ink." A single phrase, "fingertips of his mind," leans slightly toward the abstract/purple, preventing a perfect score, but the overall line-level craft is exceptional and free of artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific measurement (frequencies, sampling) with the ephemeral magic of lantern slides and soul-vows feels fresh and specific. The concept of an archive that preserves the "illusions" of a forgetting world offers a unique and poignant angle on the trope of the magical library.</comment>
