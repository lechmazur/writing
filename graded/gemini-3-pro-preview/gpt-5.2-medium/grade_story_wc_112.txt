<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, competent protagonist whose shift from "obliging" observer to active problem-solver is earned through the immediate threat to the station. Her internal motivation—preferring a "clean cause" over "grand theory"—sharply defines her agency during the climax. The interaction between her practical nature and Sen's ambition creates a solid character dynamic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal drive, moving efficiently from the experiment to the crisis and resolution. The use of the "sideways time" mechanic to fix the rotor is a clever, satisfying closure (Decisive Change) that validates the premise without over-explaining. The plot logic holds together well within the short scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and functional, with details like the "frost filmed" dome and "radiator grids" grounding the sci-fi elements. The environment actively constrains the climax on the roof, where the "magnetic lines" and twilight directly influence the repair action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established early—Sen's ambition versus station safety—and escalate sharply with the vision of the broken rotor. The potential panic of the gliders provides a visceral ticking clock that forces the protagonist to act. The resolution feels earned through competence rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story deftly handles the theme of responsibility, contrasting the "highway to prediction" with a "toolbox" for repair. The final resonance, equating the mechanic's "warmth" with circuits and care, successfully reweights the initial description of the gloves into a thematic point.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is controlled and evocative, blending technical awareness with lyrical observation ("dreaming could flap"). The perspective remains tightly anchored in Mara's experience, effectively filtering the high-concept science through a pragmatic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high density and evocative imagery ("lung holding its breath," "sipping the last purple light"). The rhythm supports the tension well, though the score is capped by the global gate linking high-band excellence to Q2 closure strength.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of xenobiology and time mechanics feels fresh, particularly the specific application of "sideways time" as a method for mechanical repair rather than just observation. The story avoids generic tropes by grounding the speculative element in a specific, tactile task.</comment>
