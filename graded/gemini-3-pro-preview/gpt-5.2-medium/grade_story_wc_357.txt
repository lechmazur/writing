<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysa’s motivation to find the source of resilience is distinct and drives the narrative efficiently toward a clear closure choice. While her agency is evident in the sacrifice of the arrow, the internal leap to trusting the object as a compass feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a coherent arc from inciting incident to a resonant closure where the protagonist reconfigures her understanding. However, the pivotal moment where the arrow functions as a magical compass relies on convenience ("She decided... tugged her") rather than earned causality, weakening the middle build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally integrated, with the gravity inversion and upward-flowing water directly constraining navigation and shaping the plot. Vivid imagery, such as roots lifting "like pale fingers" and irrigation ribbons unspooling, grounds the fantastical elements in concrete sensory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of orchard survival is clear, and the atmospheric pressure of the inversion provides a functional backdrop. While the final sacrifice of the arrow offers a legible cost, the narrative lacks immediate antagonistic pressure or substantial obstacles during the flight itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of communal resilience is coherent and culminates in the strong image of the stone tree. However, the ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("accepting that resilience was not hidden... but in a chorus"), which flattens the resonance of the final beat by explaining it rather than letting the action speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable single POV that suits the mythic tone. The focus remains tightly controlled, filtering the world effectively through Lysa’s specific goal and perceptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and dense with high information load ("smelled of rain, as if time had hurried"). However, the single-paragraph structure limits pacing variety, and occasional phrases like "made even engines seem like thoughts" drift into abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity mechanics, orchard husbandry, and the repurposing of weapons offers a fresh, specific vision. The central concept of the stone tree effectively grounds the "swords to plowshares" trope in a unique physical reality.</comment>
