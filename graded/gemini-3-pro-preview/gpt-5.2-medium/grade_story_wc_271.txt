<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mina’s trauma is embodied through specific physical details rather than mere labels, and her competence is balanced by genuine struggle during the drone incident. The choice to bury the photograph serves as a powerful, earned renunciation that solidifies her resilience without erasing the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds perfectly from the inciting drone buzz to the final image. Closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration: the burial of the photo and the "dates, not wishes" philosophy physically manifest the cost of her realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the cliff's erosion and the salt wind directly necessitate the windbreaks and mirror Mina's internal "arithmetic." The lighthouse lens serves as a potent focal point that charges the "pearl of stillness" concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are visceral and clearly defined—Mina's stability against the intrusion of past trauma. The escalation from the frozen panic to the constructive action of building windbreaks demonstrates agency under pressure, with the cost legible in her exhaustion and the buried photo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "optimism grounded in realism" is executed through concrete particulars rather than abstract moralizing. The final distinction between a "date" and a "wish" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict of survival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, filtering the world through the lexicon of an interpreter who must name things to manage them. The POV distance modulates effectively during the panic attack, staying close to Mina’s somatic experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong imagery ("crease lines looked like maps of ruined streets"), though the required phrase "somatic markers" reads as slightly clinical narration in a peak beat. Sentence rhythm effectively mirrors the shift from panic to the steady labor of planting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone strike survivor narrative with the specific maintenance of a lighthouse arboretum creates a fresh, non-obvious frame. The specific logic of the cliff—that loss is not reversible but growth is measured—grounds the premise in unique terrain.</comment>
