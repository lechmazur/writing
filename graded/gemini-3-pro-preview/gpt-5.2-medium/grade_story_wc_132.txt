<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s internal contradiction—desiring intimacy with plants "in theory but not in skin"—establishes a compelling psychological hook that drives the narrative. Her transition from resistance to acceptance is legible, though the pivotal emotional shift occurs largely in summary ("resisted it by making lists") rather than in a dramatized moment of pressure. The interaction with the boy effectively grounds her "circuitously sincere" trait in specific behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative structure relies heavily on iterative summary ("By noon," "In the evenings") which distances the reader from the climax of rebuilding the trellis. While the causal chain from the linden leaf to the transformation is coherent, the ending—mailing findings to a university—feels slightly clinical and tidy, deflating the mystical resonance of the preceding metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is tactile and atmospheric, with the "salt and thunder" and "wet crack" of the trellis creating a visceral backdrop that pressures the protagonist. The trellis functions excellently as a micro-setting that constrains the climax, forcing Mara to adapt her methods to the physical reality of the vines and weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly internalized, with the physical cost of the transformation (thickened nails, root-palms) serving as a permanent, felt price for her new understanding. However, because the struggle to rebuild the trellis is narrated in summary rather than unpacked into a high-pressure scene, the escalation feels smoother and less fraught than it could be.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "witnessing" versus "controlling" is beautifully integrated, pivoting naturally on the reconstruction of the trellis. The resolution earns its wisdom, reframing the metamorphosis not as a horror element but as a necessary evolution of her role as an observer, offering a resonant answer to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a polished, lyrical consistency that suits the fable-like quality of the story ("laugh snagged," "ship... split"). The shift in Mara's perception—sensing the nursery from below—is handled with seamless control, though the distance inherent in the summary mode keeps the reader slightly removed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich without becoming purple; lines like "boundaries... began to soften, reluctantly, like bark taking rain" are excellent. The writing avoids scaffold and maintains strong forward momentum, though a few transitions rely on standard temporal markers ("One late afternoon," "By noon").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blending the trope of plant metamorphosis with structural engineering and scientific observation offers a fresh, specific angle. The story avoids generic body horror by focusing on the functional and observational aspects of the change, though the "summary" structure is a somewhat safe choice that dampens the risk.</comment>
