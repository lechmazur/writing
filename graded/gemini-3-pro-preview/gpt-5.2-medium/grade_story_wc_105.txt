<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, sharply drawn protagonist whose synesthesia and profession directly fuel the narrative logic. Her choice to record the betrayal and immediately transmute the artifact into new work avoids generic revenge tropes, showcasing a specific "designer's" resilience. The internal conflict between grief and the technical pursuit of "the sound of trust breaking" is resolved with a high-cost realization on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure compresses three distinct timeframes (request, fabrication, fitting) into a short space, which technically exceeds the "continuous scene" default but works as a cohesive causal chain. The resolution relies on a "magic gadget" reveal (hearing the cut line in the voice), which risks convenience, but the emotional logic holds the lens securely. Closure is definitive and resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is an exceptional setting that physically manifests the themes of growth and ruin. The environment is active; the salt-tolerant roots and hull dust are utilized in the fabrication process, grounding the fantastical elements in concrete, tactile labor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stakes are deeply personal and escalate effectively through the testing of the device. The conflict transitions smoothly from a technical challenge to a moral confrontation, with the "click" of the cut line serving as a precise, devastating turning point. The cost is felt in the bruising memory that Mara must now carry and design around.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a physical force that "presses on the present" is beautifully realized through the hearing aid mechanic. The ending avoids a tidy moral about forgiveness, instead offering a complex "Conceptual Repricing" where trust is treated as a design flaw to be engineered for, integrating the betrayal into her worldview.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently filtered through Mara's synesthetic perception ("tasting blue," "yellowish sweetness") without becoming gimmicky. The sensory details align perfectly with the character's psychology, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature that enhances the mood and stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density in lines like "metals she salvaged needed memory in them." Rhythm and cadence are controlled, supporting the atmospheric tension. No significant artifacts or loops, though the poetic register remains high throughout, risking slight saturation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of "collecting absences" to engineer a hearing aid that detects betrayal is strikingly original. The synthesis of audiology, synesthesia, and forensic magic creates a unique narrative lane that feels inevitable in hindsight. The execution transforms standard mystery tropes into a fresh, character-driven study.</comment>
