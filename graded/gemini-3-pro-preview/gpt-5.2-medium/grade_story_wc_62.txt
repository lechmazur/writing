<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on summary labels ("thoughtful," "fiercely meditative") rather than dramatized behavior or micro-choices. The protagonist undergoes no visible internal struggle or resistance; his emotional state is explained to the reader rather than shown through reaction to pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is a montage ("each evening," "on the first night") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short story scope defaults and dissipating tension. The inciting incident and climax are procedural steps in a summary rather than immediate, pressurized events.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details ("panes sweating," "orange wings... like embers") are vivid and establish a distinct mood. However, the time-lapse nature of the narrative prevents the setting from exerting concrete, moment-to-moment pressure on the character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>There is a near-total absence of conflict or stakes; the "distant thunder" is explicitly "without fear," and the spectral mentor provides solutions without exacting a price. The resolution is achieved through a helpful supernatural shortcut and a compliant family ritual, lacking any earned cost or obstacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through didactic statement ("turning private mourning into one chord") rather than subtext or emergent action. The ending relies on a sentimental assertion of unity that feels unearned by the preceding low-stakes process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance that fits the summary mode but keeps the reader emotionally removed. The omniscient filtering explains meaning before events can generate it, flattening the dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Prose is weakened by heavy reliance on telling and forced phrasing ("throbbed in him like calm thunder") that disrupts clarity. The repeated insertion of required phrases ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") creates palpable artifacts that mar the rhythm and logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The central concept of tracing the "pauses" in chisel marks to map grief is inventive and poetic. However, the execution relies on standard tropes (helpful ghost, convenient revelation) that undercut the freshness of the core idea.</comment>
