<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lysa is a distinct, purposeful protagonist whose specific tools (eartrumpets) and actions ground her characterization. The primary weakness is the expository handling of her key trait ("because she was sensitively perceptive"), which relies on a direct label rather than purely dramatized behavior. Her final choice to abandon the diaries' plea and mark the new north demonstrates agency and defines her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is cohesive, moving from investigation to realization with a clear, resonant closure. The connection between the physical alignment of the tapestry and the metaphysical "displaced axis" is handled with strong poetic logic, though the specific realization about "dreaming minds" anchoring the axis feels slightly more like an epiphany than a causally derived conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the silo's geometry acts as the compass that validates the "displaced axis." Specific details like the "concrete remembered the loom's rhythm" and the "sunlight poured through the warp" tightly integrate the physical environment with the central conflict, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are conceptual but clear—the loss of direction versus the preservation of truth. The conflict escalates quietly through the discovery of the diaries' plea ("Set the axis back") and resolves with Lysa's decision to accept the shift, a choice that carries the cost of leaving the old world behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of navigating a broken world is powerfully developed through the central metaphor of the axis and the loom. The ending avoids simple reassurance, offering instead a "quiet correction" that respects the permanence of the loss while establishing a new mode of existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like quality ("soft clutter," "sealed mouth") that suits the subject matter. There is a slight reliance on explanatory bridging ("She called that night...") that creates occasional distance, but the tone remains controlled and evocative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense with sensory imagery ("smelling of cedar and panic," "bronze dust"), creating a strong texture. However, some sentence structures rely on telling or scaffolding ("Her work was not to...", "because she was sensitively perceptive") which dampens the immediacy of the otherwise strong show-don't-tell moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-dream apocalypse with a physical axis shift is a fresh, imaginative concept. The execution avoids generic tropes by grounding the metaphysical problem in specific, tactile tools (tapestry, chisel, compass silo).</comment>
