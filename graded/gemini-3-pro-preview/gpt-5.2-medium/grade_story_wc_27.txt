<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ilya is distinct with sensory-grounded traits ("barefoot," "refused boots") that imply vulnerability and specific worldview. However, the specific trait "awkwardly confident" is repeated as a label three times rather than dramatized through distinct micro-actions during the decoding sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the discovery of the stones to the transmission, ending in effective Charged Poise. The pivot relies on a slightly convenient convergence of the hum, star intervals, and previously unmentioned "pilgrimage charts" to solve the puzzle, softening the causal rigor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the "dead docks" and "ancient stone circle" function as essential tools for the resolution rather than mere backdrop. Sensory details ("oily gusts," "rivets quiver") are vivid, and the physical constraints of the circle shape the protagonist's tactical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are established early via the "lull" and escalated through the decision to break radio silence despite the risk. While the antagonist is abstract until the final footsteps, the internal pressure to find meaning drives the narrative momentum effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of resonance—bridging the ancient (stones) and the future (rebellion)—is woven effectively through the action. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, answering the silence with a connection that feels earned without didactic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, maintaining close psychic distance to Ilya's perception. The shift from observation to the decisiveness of the transmission is handled smoothly, though the reliance on the "awkwardly confident" tag slightly flattens the voice's descriptive range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-density and rhythmic ("Thunder rolled... repair bay breathed"), but the verbatim repetition of the phrase "awkwardly confident" (and a third variation) within a short word count creates a noticeable lexical artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of "techno-druidism" with a sci-fi rebellion context offers a fresh aesthetic. The specific execution—using opera glasses to map sound to stars—transforms familiar tropes into a distinct, memorable solution.</comment>
