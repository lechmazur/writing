<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Iris's compensatory motivation (replacing scent with visual deduction) is compelling and drives her agency. However, the resolution relies on secondary characters yielding instantly and perfectly to her intervention, which feels slightly diagnostic and unearned by the brief interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the shop to the birthing house and back with clear causality. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands well, though the ease of the climax flattens the potential impact of the "miracle."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "occluded view" motif (fog, steam, wet glass) is masterfully integrated, constraining the protagonist's perception and shaping the mood without feeling decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established early, but the external conflict lacks sufficient friction; the father's anger dissipates instantly upon hearing Iris's sentence, resolving the tension with a "magic words" beat rather than a struggle with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding truth in broken things is well-dramatized through the screw and the setting. However, the final sentence explicitly summarizes the lesson ("teaching people to read what they already meant"), which diminishes the subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Iris's specific sensory limitations. The shift from aromatherapist to visual observer is handled with strong control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with sensory imagery ("softening brass gears," "reddish tarnish"). Metaphors are generally strong, though occasionally dense ("ink blots like swallowed words"), but they serve the POV well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a scent-deprived aromatherapist working in a water clock shop to repair emotions is a fresh, specific synthesis of elements that elevates the "healer" trope.</comment>
