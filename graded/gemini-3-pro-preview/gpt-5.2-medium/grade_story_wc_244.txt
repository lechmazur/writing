<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara is vividly characterized with specific, contradictory traits ("bright but hungry," "jokes the way others made fire") that drive the narrative. The pivot revealing her as a fellow patient rather than just a provider adds significant depth and reframes the relationship dynamics effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong, with the "cooling" mechanic effectively driving the narrator's actions and the transition from client to companion. While the exchange sequence relies on summary ("I gave... the barber mended...") rather than a fully dramatized beat, the closure lands with a resonant, earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is realized with evocative, atmospheric details ("ivy curtains," "cracked suitcase") that establish the specific tone of magical realism. The station functions as a neutral ground that actively shapes the "polite anarchy" of the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emotional stakes are clear and escalate well as the narrator is forced to trade isolation for engagement. While the external pressure is relatively low-intensity, the personal cost of participation—giving up resources and emotional safety—is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of shared burden is poignant and resolves beautifully in the final image of "shared silence." However, the articulation of the core concept in dialogue ("You cannot own this, because it is bound by reciprocity") feels slightly didactic and expository.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending lyrical observation with a grounded, weary resilience that suits the subject matter. Dialogue is sharp and characterizes Mara instantly ("look terrible, so you must be serious"), supporting the tone well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and high-quality, with original imagery ("jokes the way others made fire," "swallowed by green") that enhances the atmosphere. The sentence rhythm is controlled, though the repetition of the phrase "improbable rumor chains" is a minor echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of disaster logistics with a fable-like "cure for loneliness" offers a fresh, specific angle on a familiar trope. The "moon rock" mechanic provides a grounded, tangible focus for the abstract concept of connection.</comment>
