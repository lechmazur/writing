<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ilya creates a complete arc from arrogance to collaboration, but his internal landscape is largely summarized rather than dramatized. The transition from his initial "uncommon serenity" to the "earned" softness relies on stated realizations ("he saw half-lit epiphanies") rather than pressure-filled choices in the moment. The "urbane calligrapher" persona feels disconnected from the "seedy bar puppeteer" reality, existing more as a quirky label than a coherent identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from "synopsisitis," compressing a complex timeline into summary beats ("Tonight...", "On opening night...", "Weeks later") that dilute tension. The structural jump to the "weeks later" epilogue creates a "Symmetric Satisfaction" ending where all conflict dissolves into a happy circle, undercutting the raw cost of the contract signed in the bar. The pacing moves too fast to let the stakes land viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The radar dome is a striking, well-utilized setting; the "white bubble that once listened for enemies" effectively mirrors the thematic need for listening. Sensory details like "sky the color of cold tin" and the "meteor hush" establish a strong, consistent atmosphere. The setting actively frames the protagonist's introspection and final transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central stake—ethical storytelling versus artistic autonomy—is clear, and the "reverse story" mechanism is a clever dramatization of the conflict. The contract on the napkin represents a tangible cost (loss of control). However, the opposition is weak; the audience’s reaction is summarized ("laughter turned to a quiet"), and Mara’s acceptance feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The story leans heavily into didacticism, explicitly stating its moral questions ("Who profits, who is harmed...") and concluding with a sermonizing thematic summary ("only ending worth writing was one everyone could consent to"). This overt moralizing in the final paragraph flattens the narrative into a fable, removing the ambiguity required for literary resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and polished but maintains an emotional distance that feels like a report on the events rather than an immersion in them. The elevated tone ("flourish back to bone") occasionally clashes with the "seedy bar" context. The voice tells us what Ilya feels instead of embodying the feeling through syntax or perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose relies too heavily on explanatory scaffolding and summary (e.g., "He came here to explore ethical storytelling," "Mara told him she did not want..."). These "telling" artifacts rob scenes of immediacy. While the imagery is often good, the connective tissue is expository, acting as a shortcut through the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—calligraphy, a radar dome, and subversive puppetry—is undeniably fresh and creates a unique aesthetic. The concept of "unstealing" a story by performing it backward is a genuinely ingenious metaphor for restitution. The originality is high, even if the execution leans on summary.</comment>
