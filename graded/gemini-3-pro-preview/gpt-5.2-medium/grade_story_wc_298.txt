<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s defining traits (“reckless idealist,” “fiercely gentle”) act as the crucible for the story’s central moral choice. Her refusal to steal a destiny, despite her desperation, perfectly dramatizes the "fiercely gentle" attribute, while the self-sacrificial bargain earns the "reckless" descriptor with high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and escalates cleanly from the brother’s relapse to the broker’s confrontation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts eternal pain to lock the trade—lands with undeniable, visceral cost ("yesterday's hurt fresh as dawn") and logical permanence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "Orchard of Quiet Trade" is vividly rendered, with specific details like "skulls like pale apples" and "roots... as runes" integrating strictly into the plot. The setting physically constrains the magic (the thread tied to the tooth), moving beyond backdrop to active mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and escalates through the broker's counter-offer, which forces Mira to define her moral boundaries. The shift from a simple repair job to a permanent binding against "harvesting" deepens the stakes, and the cost paid is significant and irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of trauma and the price of healing is handled with sophistication, avoiding simple cures. The final image of holes becoming seams offers a profound Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's suffering, earning resonance without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like yet gritty tone that suits the setting. The transition from the physical description of the orchard to the metaphysical mechanics of the trade is handled smoothly without breaking the POV’s perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("smile thin as onion skin"), with strong rhythm. A few usages are slightly heterodox (e.g., "trammel it onto Jory," "barrow a stranger's destiny"), but they generally serve the agricultural/harvest metaphor well within the established voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The "bartered destiny" trope is refreshed by the visceral, anatomical specificity of the orchard (trees growing from rib cages). The specific nature of the trade—memory of pain for security—adds a unique emotional dimension to the standard "deal with the devil" arc.</comment>
