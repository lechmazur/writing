<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara is a sharply defined protagonist whose "involuntary truth" acts as a rigorous constraint, driving the plot rather than just coloring it. Her rationality is active, demonstrated through her research into "discredited textbooks" and her testing of the eye, which establishes strong agency. The choice to embrace secrecy at the end is a character-specific evolution that feels earned by the pressure of the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is robust: the specific disability compels the search for a specific cure, which is then tested and immediately put under high-stakes pressure by the Ministry patrol. While the transition summarizing the "storm season" acts as a functional bridge, the climax effectively forces a decision that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to truth. The closure lands a decisive "Conceptual Repricing" of safety, validating the cost of secrecy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "hanging orchard" is utilized as a dynamic physical force, not just a backdrop; the "sway" of the trees directly necessitates the ocular dampening mechanic. Specific details like the "roots boxed in cradles" and "pear platform" ground the high-concept premise in a tactile reality. The setting's vertigo complements the internal instability of the "empathy virus" aftermath perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from the personal discomfort of the protagonist to the specific threat of Lio's relic, culminating in the external danger of the Ministry patrol. The climax is a precise test of the story's central mechanic—using the eye to occlude truth under interrogation—resulting in a tangible victory with a lingering moral cost (the burden of hiddenness).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative explores the tension between "truth as shrapnel" and the need for "psychological safety" with nuance, avoiding a simple binary rejection of honesty. The concluding concept of "fractured grace" resonates as a hard-won compromise, successfully integrating the prompt's thematic requirement into the dramatic action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a disciplined consistency, blending the "rational" ledger-keeping tone of the forager with the heightened sensitivity of the empathy-stricken survivor. The shift in perception when the eye is applied—"words came slower, kinder"—is a masterstroke of showing interior change through physiological constraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, balancing action with rich sensory details like "wind thread the ladders" and "clinic of quiet." The writing remains propellant and clear even when handling abstract concepts, with no visible artifacts or scaffold loops to mar the immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-pandemic social dynamic with the specific, vertiginous setting and the antique medical-magic object feels distinct and fresh. The interpretation of "occlusion" as a psychological shield transforms a standard "truth curse" trope into a novel mechanic with physical weight.</comment>
