<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, internally consistent protagonist whose transition from observer to active participant is well-motivated by her intellectual curiosity. The realization that her loneliness was a "closed system" anchors the character arc effectively, providing emotional weight to the cerebral plot. While the internal conflict is somewhat retrospective rather than driving the scene's peak, the shift in stance at the closure is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear situational drive, moving logically from hypothesis (geometry) to experiment (the scarf) to application (helping the patron). Closure lands successfully as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her role from librarian of books to cataloger of connection. The progression is smooth, perhaps slightly lacking in obstacle friction, but the causal chain holds firmly under the magical realist lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, acting as both container and engine for the plot; the "scientific poetry" concept is rigorously applied through details like "Thermodynamics of Yearning" and "non-Euclidean elegies." The architecture itself constrains and guides the protagonist’s choices, fulfilling the highest standard for setting integration. The atmosphere of "observed solitude" perfectly supports the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily intellectual and atmospheric; while the tension of discovery is maintained, the external pressure is low and the protagonist faces few active threats or difficult trade-offs. The escalation is steady and linear, fitting the quiet tone, but lacks the sharp foreclosure of options or high-cost risks typically required for the highest bands in conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of stories as "relations stitched... in curving space" rather than static objects is sophisticated and arises organically from the action. The synthesis of math and memory leads to a resonant closure that reweights the initial premise without resorting to explicit moralizing. The ending successfully expands the story's scope beyond the immediate scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is precise and lyrical, perfectly matching the "sanely eccentric" worldview of the protagonist. Narrative distance is well-controlled, zooming in for the tactile interaction with the scarf and out for the architectural theories. The tone manages to be whimsical without losing the grounded, "scientific" texture of the prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery like "bookmark for the air" and "grain shifted... like a living proof." The sentence rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing down for the mathematical contemplation and flowing during the magical realization. There are no visible artifacts, loops, or filter-verb stacks to impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise feels fresh, distinguishing itself by grounding its magical realism in hyperbolic geometry rather than generic fantasy tropes. The specific combination of library science, mathematics, and memory creates a unique textural signature. The execution commits fully to its "scientific poetry" logic.</comment>
