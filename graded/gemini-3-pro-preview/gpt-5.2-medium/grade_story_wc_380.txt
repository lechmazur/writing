<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lysa’s motivation is deeply rooted in personal loss, driving her agency from the coffee reading to the excavation. The emotional arc is compelling, though the interaction with the foreman relies on a slightly convenient role-based permission rather than active maneuvering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure—accepting sorrow to regain identity—lands with weight. However, the foreman's permission serves as a low-resistance plot gate, and the resolution via coffee-ground instructions compresses the final agency into a magical guide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The salt chamber and gravity pockets are visceral, constraining physical action (tying to the pipe) and charging the atmosphere. The integration of the setting with the memory concept is seamless, distinct, and shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are intimately personal yet scale to the community, with a clear choice between painless oblivion and painful truth. The cost of the resolution—the return of "lived-in sorrow"—is legible and meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a necessary anchor for identity is woven through every beat, culminating in a resonant final image that refuses a tidy happy ending in favor of emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending lyrical observation with determined agency. The narrative distance feels appropriate, allowing access to Lysa’s internal state while maintaining the story's fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("sweet rot," "sounds like light"), creating a strong sensory experience without wasted motion. The sentence-level craft effectively supports the magical realist tone without lapsing into abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a beached whale, gravity anomalies, and salt-preserved memories offers a fresh, specific take on memory loss tropes. The biological/eldritch layer of the parasite adds distinct flavor to the concept.</comment>
