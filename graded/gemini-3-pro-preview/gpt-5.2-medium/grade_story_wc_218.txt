<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and the "brazen calm" effectively establishes a stoic emotional shield, but the heavy reliance on narrative summary creates distance. The reader is told of her physical struggle ("chest ached") and resolve rather than witnessing micro-choices or visceral reactions in a dramatized moment. The characterization feels more mythic and remote than intimate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The story relies on a montage structure ("For years," "One night," "Soon," "With her remaining weeks") which violates the preference for immediate, scene-based causality. While the closure lands a resonant reconfiguration, the execution reads like a fable's synopsis rather than a dramatized narrative, lacking the immediacy of a specific time-bound crisis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the "living stone pillars" with their "unread script" for roots are not just backdrop but the central engine of the plot. The bio-architectural constraints are woven vividly into the action, enabling the protagonist's solution and grounding the high-concept premise in tactile detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The stakes of legacy and survival are high, but the conflict is dampened by the summary mode; the monks' opposition is reported ("The monks complained") rather than shown in a tense interaction. The "brazen calm" tone, while requested, acts as a damper on the conflict, smoothing over potential friction points too easily.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of interspecies reliance is strong, but the narrative slides into explicit moralizing in the final act. The narrator's insertion of the thesis ("secrets were not about hiding treasure...") and the didactic structure of the final gathering ("asked every speaker to name a species") reduce the interpretive space for the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, mythic quality that suits the fable-like structure and the protagonist's "brazen calm." The narrative distance is stable and the tone modulates well between the scientific observation of the diary and the spiritual resonance of the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic with high-density imagery ("veined with lichen," "rain turned the courtyard into a shallow mirror"). However, the discovery beat relies on filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") rather than direct experience, and the summary mode limits the visceral impact of the line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of botany and architecture into a "living script" is a fresh, non-obvious concept that elevates the standard "legacy" trope. While the "wise elder teaching the community" arc is familiar, the specific mechanism of the hydraulic stone pillars adds significant ingenuity.</comment>
