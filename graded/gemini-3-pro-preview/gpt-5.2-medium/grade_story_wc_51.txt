<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s professional competence is distinct and grounding, balancing the fable-like tone with concrete labor. The internal burden ("fear of empty hands") adds necessary dimension, though its late reveal feels slightly more expository than dramatized in the early beats. The widow's inclusion effectively grounds the magical transaction in human cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Situational Drive, where the environment acts as the primary antagonist. The trap is established quickly, and the resolution via alignment—foreshadowed by the lamp burner’s design—provides a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with the cost of perpetual vigilance ("orientation must be chosen each time").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto is not merely a backdrop but an active constraint; the "shingled hush" and bronze reflectivity directly shape the plot and the solution. The specific interaction between the lamp’s mechanics and the setting’s "drowned constellations" anchors the magic in tangible geometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly escalated by the "thickening hush" threatening to erase the weaver's agency. While the escape mechanism is clever, the moment of "boundary-lessly trapped" feels slightly brief; the struggle is resolved intellectually rather than through a prolonged endurance of the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of translating raw grief into structural support ("whalebone") is sophisticated and successfully executed without heavy-handed moralizing. The final image of the soot mark and the alignment ritual serves as a potent Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist’s role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, high-fantasy lyricism that suits the fable genre. The shift from the professional detachment of the weaver to the vulnerability of the "whalebone reverie" is handled smoothly, maintaining distinct focalization throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative ("light did not spread so much as sink"). However, the metaphor "kelp reads tide" slips into mixed agency (kelp reacts; it does not decode), and the required adverb "boundary-lessly" creates a rhythmic stumble in an otherwise polished sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving, geometry, and grief offers a fresh take on the "sin-eater" trope. The concept of the "fractal weaver" creating non-repeating patterns to trap burdens is imaginative and feels specific to this world.</comment>
