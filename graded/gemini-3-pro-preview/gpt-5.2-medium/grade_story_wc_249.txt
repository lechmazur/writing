<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shared grief between the protagonist and Sato creates a compelling, mirrored internal landscape. The protagonist's shift from "guinea pig" to co-conspirator is earned through the shared vulnerability of the memory-meld, though the "rebellion" manifests more as a shared coping mechanism than a sharp conflict of interest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the setup of the experiment to the climax of the shared vision and a resonant aftermath. The coda, where the protagonist returns and opens the gate by drumming, borders on dream-logic (bypassing security), but effectively cements the thematic resolution of keeping the dream alive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" and "auric lagoon" are vivid, specific, and integral to the plot's mechanics. The sensory details—vibrations, gold algae, cold fire—create a distinct, immersive atmosphere that grounds the more abstract memory elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly established (resurrection vs. empathy, mental safety vs. closure). The climax relies on the "institute alarms/neural overload" trope to force the break, which is functional but less character-driven than the emotional confrontation preceding it. The protagonist's choice to endure the pain for the vision is a strong moment of agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "memory shared without being owned" lands with precision. The story deftly handles the intersection of science and grief without becoming maudlin, and the ending image reconfigures the initial premise into a resonant act of ongoing remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, suiting the subject matter. At times, the register becomes slightly uniform in its poetic intensity ("constellation of gestures," "auroral sorrow"), but the control of interiority remains strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically strong but dense with metaphor ("ink and saline," "hush of the universe inhaling"), occasionally drifting into purple territory. While the imagery is evocative, the density of figurative language sometimes slows the narrative momentum in key causal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic science and metaphysical grief offers a fresh take on the "memory recording" trope. The specific mechanism of the garden and the drumming interface adds a unique tactile layer to the concept.</comment>
