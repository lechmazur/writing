<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Noah’s internal drive to "bottle safety" provides a strong emotional spine, and his "warmly observant" nature is well-dramatized in his interactions with Maris. However, his professional competence strains credibility when he prioritizes building rock stacks over immediately fixing a critical navigation light during a crisis, creating a disconnect between his character traits and his actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>A significant causal breach undermines the narrative: the protagonist delays fixing a lighthouse failure for a full night and day to build small stone cairns, which a ship impossibly sees through fog. This prioritization lacks on-page justification and disconnects the high stakes (shipwreck) from the protagonist's primary activity, treating a mechanical emergency with fable logic that clashes with the established realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmospheric detail is vivid and specific, effectively using the "wick lamp trembling" and the "aching" lens to ground the "haunted" tone. The sensory environment is palpable, with details like bleeding fingers and the smell of old watchfulness enhancing the scene's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>High stakes are established early with the threat to freighters, but the tension sags because the protagonist’s response (stacking stones) feels disproportionate and mechanically ineffective against the established threat. The climax—fixing the light—arrives as a delayed procedural step rather than a driven peak, diluting the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of anonymous, communal care is poignant and coherently developed through the letter chain and the cairn ritual. The resolution reconfigures the "haunting" from a source of fear into a supportive lineage, achieving a resonant emotional closure that feels earned despite the plot's logical wobbles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and observant ("throat refusing to sing"), fitting the protagonist's worldview well. However, control slips significantly with a jarring tense shift ("went dim... then the lamp flickers out") that disrupts the consistent past-tense frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the prose is generally dense and evocative, the clumsy repetition of the phrase "the lamp flickers out"—which also introduces a grammatical tense error—is a glaring artifact that mars the reading experience. This specific flaw, likely a forced insertion of a required element, breaks the line-level polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the lighthouse setting with the cairn ritual offers a specific, imaginative variation on the lonely keeper trope. While the logical execution prevents it from reaching higher bands, the concept of a "chain of anonymous letters" anchored by sea glass is a fresh and engaging premise.</comment>
