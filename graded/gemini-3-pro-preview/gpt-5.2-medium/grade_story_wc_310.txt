<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s agency is absolute; she translates abstract "purpose" into high-risk engineering decisions (splitting the dish) against crew resistance. Her "quiet enthusiasm" operates as a tangible constraint on her behavior, driving her to act when others freeze, and the final realization of the loop is deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Flawless execution of a causal loop (bootstrap paradox) where the closure recontextualizes the opening without confusion. The "edgewise coin" serves as a precise pivot point that forces the climax, and the cost (burning the last fuel) is visibly paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "bruise lit from within" and "ambered" deck provide vivid, non-generic anchors that ground the high-concept premise. The contracting universe acts as a functional constraint, physically limiting options and forcing the "split dish" solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "edgewise coin" acts as a brilliant escalation, transforming a binary choice into a desperate, risky third option that raises the physical stakes. The tension between the prophecy's fatal prediction and the necessary action maintains coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shift from "predicting the future" to "creating the past" is a profound thematic turn that is dramatized rather than preached. The final realization that "purpose is a loop" lands with immense conceptual weight, perfectly repricing the story's events.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, blending technical urgency with lyricism ("sacrament made of chemistry and fear"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Mara’s specific perception of the "backwards" language without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with evocative imagery ("stubborn little planets," "void is stuttering") and no scaffold artifacts. The prose rhythm accelerates effectively with the calibration sequence, and the "edgewise" motif pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient divination (coins/lots) with hard sci-fi time mechanics is inventive and specifically rendered. The resolution—interpreting the edgewise coin as a schematic instruction to split the dish—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
