<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is deeply realized, blending professional cynicism ("burglar of light") with vulnerability. Her specific compulsion—the looping lyrics—anchors the magical premise in personal need, and her choice to use her own letters in the ritual creates a strong emotional bridge that earns the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from a haunting hook to a ritualistic release that feels inevitable yet surprising. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical act of projecting blank light resolves both the external mystery and the internal ache with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with tactile precision ("grease pencil," "cold film can") and atmospheric weight ("folding velvet"). The setting is not just a backdrop but a toolset for the resolution, integrating perfectly with the psychometric mechanic to ground the magic in specific machinery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but clearly defined; the pressure of the "unused love" is palpable and accumulates effectively. The escalation works through the sensory intensification of the vision and the physical act of threading the film, though the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "unused love" stored in "unfinished rituals" is woven masterfully through the imagery of blank film and lost lyrics. The ending avoids moralizing, offering instead a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question through the final image of the delivered letter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and suitably lyrical for the genre. The figurative language is dense but consistent with Mara's "crystal gazer" perspective, maintaining a coherent perceptual signature throughout the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with evocative imagery ("shame itself had archived it," "corridors of air"). While the density of similes is high, they are functionally distinct and deepen the atmosphere without stalling momentum or confusing the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of film projection mechanics with psychometry creates a fresh, compelling metaphor for memory and loss. The concept of "blankness as a container" offers a genuinely ingenious angle on the ghost story archetype that feels specific to this character and setting.</comment>
