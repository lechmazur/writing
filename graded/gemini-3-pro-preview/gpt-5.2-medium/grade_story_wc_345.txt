<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The collective "we" POV creates distance, flattening individual internal conflict into group consensus. While Mara and Jai have roles, they function as archetypes rather than distinct characters making difficult choices under pressure. The transition from suspicion to trust is summarized rather than dramatized through a high-stakes interpersonal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("tight months," "each morning") rather than a specific, high-pressure scene. This synopsis-like structure dilutes the inciting incident and climax, reducing the visceral impact of the events. Closure is present and logical, but the linear progression lacks a sharp, earned turning point on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and imaginative, with "slow-spinning stone bridges" and "pears" creating a distinct, mythic atmosphere. Specific sensory details like the "brass watering bell hung from a trellis" and "white chalk lines" anchor the world effectively. The environment actively shapes the survivors' available resources and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflict is largely external (labor, entropy) and low-stakes interpersonal friction; the "questions" about the ghost are resolved easily by evidence without forcing a painful trade-off. The cooperation feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and the lack of active opposition or deep internal flaws makes the victory feel smooth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("family was a practice, not a bloodline"). This direct statement replaces earned subtext with a sermonizing conclusion, flattening the narrative's potential resonance into a lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "we" voice is consistent and sustained, possessing a polished, fable-like quality that fits the setting. However, the collective narration creates an emotional remove that prevents the stakes from feeling urgent or intimate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, with strong imagery ("translucent as mist yet steady as a lighthouse"). There is a slight tendency toward "purple" abstraction ("star-scented window," "belonging were fuel"), but the line-level craft is generally solid and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of an orchard planet with a helpful ghost technician and specific analog tools (chalk, bell) is fresh and charming. While the "found family" arc is standard, the specific mechanical execution of the ghost's help offers a unique flavor.</comment>
