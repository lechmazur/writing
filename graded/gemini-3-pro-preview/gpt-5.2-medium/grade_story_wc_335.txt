<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lio is a vivid, contradictory focalizer; his habit of walking backward and his "combative tenderness" create a distinct, embodied presence. The relationship dynamic shifts authentically from guarded hostility to shared resilience, earning the emotional breakthrough in a short space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story achieves a resonant closure via a Decisive Change that is both magical and psychological; the cost (admitting fear) is paid on the page. The "ritual" logic of the tea leaves and shadow holds firmly under a Situational/Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "shadow caught in glass" is a masterclass in object-as-setting, actively constraining the climax and charging the final image. The atmospheric details (library hush, bitter leaves) are purposeful and specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and high (identity vs. exile), and the pressure escalates clearly through the trembling hand and the writhe of the shadow. The "struggle" beat is slightly compressed, but the emotional turning point is sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "angles" of truth and the cost of returning home is sophisticated and woven into the magic system without preaching. The ending recontextualizes the concept of pardon into "proof of return," offering deep resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, perfectly matching the fable-like tone. The shift in Lio's internal state—from nervous preparation to proud mentorship—is handled with seamless distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("listens like a lung holding breath," "pride makes its own key"). While the repetition of "combative tenderness" is slightly close, the imagery is consistently fresh and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "reversible exile" concept and the mechanics of shard-mirrors offer a genuinely fresh synthesis of memory and magic. The idea of aligning physical geometry to alter a past event's shadow is inventive.</comment>
