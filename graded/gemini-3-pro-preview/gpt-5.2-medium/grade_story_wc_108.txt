<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, blending specific phobias with an adaptive nature that drives the plot. However, her sudden shift from terrified compliance to "vulnerability is power" feels more like a thematic assertion than a dramatized psychological progression, and the "adaptive" trait functions largely as a license for convenient puzzle-solving skills.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Causality strains significantly under the contrived nature of the clues; the antagonist writing incriminating dates on a child's cast only to wipe them is implausible. The climax relies on unearned mechanics, where a seashell inexplicably functions as a tape recorder and smudged notes physically "project" onto a wall, breaking the story's established reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and distinct, with strong sensory details like "iron shelves bled orange dust" and moths like "shredded film" anchoring the gothic-industrial tone. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist’s decayed sense of self, though the library's convenient preservation of specific production codes is a minor stretch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the stakes of identity and survival are established, the climax lacks genuine resistance; the antagonist passively allows Mara to broadcast her confession without physical intervention. The victory is achieved through a sudden "reveal" rather than an escalating struggle, deflating the tension built in the setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming one's narrative is clear but handled heavily, with the central message ("vulnerability is power") explicitly stated rather than emerging organically. The ending relies on a moralizing summary ("I did not win by being fearless...") that tells the reader how to interpret the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and engaging, maintaining a sombre, poetic tone that suits the dark subject matter. The perspective stays firmly with Mara, filtering the world through her trauma and professional lens, though the "we would not hide anymore" promise to the boy feels slightly hurried.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative and dense, with striking imagery ("studio's mirrors looked like traps"). However, occasional overwriting appears in personified emotions ("certainty that trembled in my chest said"), and the mechanics of the final image ("projected... like subtitles") are confusingly phrased, blurring the line between metaphor and literal action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise of a stunt double surgically altered to replace a dead star is compelling and fresh. However, the execution falls back on standard tropes—the villain explaining his crimes via clues he created, and a public exposure leading to immediate mutiny—which undermines the novelty of the setup.</comment>
