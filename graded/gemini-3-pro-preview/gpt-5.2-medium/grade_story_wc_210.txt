<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sen is a strongly defined protagonist with a clear internal philosophy (rejecting false comfort) that drives the plot. His internal discipline is rendered well ("false comfort as poison"), but the secondary characters (the woman, the families) function more as archetypes to facilitate the fable-like progression rather than distinct individuals exerting pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The causal logic is sound, tracing a clear path from resource extraction to societal revival. However, the story relies heavily on narrative summary and montage ("On the third morning," "Word traveled," "By the month of new tides") rather than dramatized scene work. This flattens the narrative arc into a synopsis-like sequence, violating the single-scene default without the density of a true mosaic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with tactile specificity that reinforces the theme; the transition from magical abstraction to physical materials (lye, fish oil, driftwood) is excellent. Details like the "paper frames nested like bones" and the "lantern ring stored in a shed" effectively ground the high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes (civilization vs. easy magic) are high and clear, but the opposition is overcome too easily through summary. The conflict with the woman and the town council lacks visceral, on-page heat; their capitulation is reported rather than fought for, reducing the felt cost of the revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic repricing of the bottle from a vessel of luck to a vessel of memory is brilliant and lands a powerful resonant closure. The concept of an "economy of miracles" collapsing into honest labor is handled with sophistication, though the score is capped (limit 8.8) due to the Q2 structural compression.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately fable-like ("quiet as a blown out wick," "postcard to nobody"). The distance is managed well, maintaining a close focus on Sen’s intellect while surveying the broader changes in the town.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and dense, with strong imagery and no visible artifacts or loops. The line-level craft successfully supports the fable tone, though "deserted alchemist" (likely meaning "deserter" or "disillusioned") reads as a slight usage ambiguity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of using chemistry and labor to replace magic in a fantasy setting is a fresh, mature take on the genre. The subversion of the "magical artifact" trope—where the bottle's value lies in remaining sealed—is genuinely ingenious.</comment>
