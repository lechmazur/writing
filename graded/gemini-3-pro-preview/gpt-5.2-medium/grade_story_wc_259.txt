<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates strong agency, driven by a clear, conflicted motivation (forbidden knowledge vs. safety). The internal shift—from seeking knowledge to managing its burden—is earned through the climax and solidified by the final choice to lie to the elders and alter teaching methods. The cost of "loss of innocence" is tangible in the final behavior change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causality is tight and moves logically from the inciting theft to the mechanical climax with the pagoda. The mechanism of "avoiding patterns" to counteract the "atoms of nostalgia" provides a coherent, rigorous logic for the resolution. Closure is decisive, recontextualizing the protagonist's role in the city.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "taste of old copper," "violet" windows, and the "bronze prism pagoda" effectively ground the high-concept premise. The setting acts as a crucible, with the archive's specific history (Keth ruins) directly enabling the plot. The atmosphere supports the tone of heavy, dangerous memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (safety vs. truth) and escalate appropriately through the visions in the light corridors. The pressure is both external (Elders' laws) and internal (seduction of nostalgia), culminating in a choice that carries emotional weight. The cost is visible in the protagonist's weeping and the subsequent burden of secrecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of nostalgia as a "contagion" rather than a comfort is explored with nuance and sophistication. The resolution—teaching in "spirals and leaps" to avoid the "cages" of nostalgia—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, elevated register appropriate for a historian of a lost empire. While effective, the tone occasionally risks detachment due to its high formality. The perspective remains stable, filtering observations through the protagonist's specific expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers slightly from density in figurative language (e.g., "walls sweated forgotten names," "joy... hurt like a pulled tooth"). These metaphors, while vivid, crowd the high-pressure beats. Mechanically, the sentences propel the narrative well without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of "atoms of nostalgia" as a physical, weaponized force is a fresh and compelling synthesis. The twist on the "Purge" being self-inflicted adds depth to the standard "lost empire" trope. The specific mechanic of the prism pagoda grounding the abstract concept helps originality.</comment>
