<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is inextricably linked to the magic system and plot; Mara's personal history (the fire) serves as the crucible for the climax. Her choice to intervene is specific, embodying a "protector" role that costs her emotional comfort, and her internal state ("throat full of ash") remains visceral throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is tightly wound; the photograph serves as a perfect plant-and-payoff mechanism, transforming from a mystery object to the tool of resolution. The closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ghost's message) lands with earned emotional weight and clear logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hearing aid functions as a brilliant micro-setting/tool that constrains the protagonist's attention and guides the scene's progression. The atmospheric details ("sweated fog," "reeling hush") effectively frame the narrative's mood without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stakes are high and immediate (a suicide intervention), escalated by the twist that the antagonist is the protagonist's own mother. The pressure is coherent, and the resolution requires active agency—revising the message—rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of revising grief is resonant and organically developed through the plot. A slight deduction only for the somewhat explicit thematic summary in the climax ("the dead could only repeat..."), but it functions well as magical logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistently lyrical, managing the shift from bureaucratic detachment to personal crisis smoothly. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, staying close to Mara's sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("soft metronome," "fading like footsteps"), with a strong rhythmic reprise of "reeling hush." A minor deduction for the cliché "calm as rain," but otherwise the line-level craft is precise and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" synthesizes pandemic-era terminology with ghost story tropes in a genuinely fresh way. The "revision" mechanic for ghosts offers a unique angle on the genre.</comment>
