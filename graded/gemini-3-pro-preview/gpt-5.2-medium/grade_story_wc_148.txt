<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict—chasing "hush" to counter his father's legacy of noise and lies—is compelling and successfully drives the narrative. The voice is distinct, blending a mythical burden with gritty prison reality. The transition to the magical element of "hovering" feels slightly abrupt in terms of physical grounding, but the emotional logic holds firm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from a specific backstory to a high-tension discovery and a resonant "Charged Poise" closure. The ending leaves the door ajar both literally and metaphorically, paying off the setup with a felt cost: the protagonist possesses the truth but knows he remains the "cry-wolf" boy in the eyes of the world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the lighthouse prison is not just a backdrop but the labyrinth that shapes the protagonist's movement and discovery. Sensory details like "mottled with salt" and the "lattice" create a visceral, specific atmosphere that supports the "copperlight repose" tone perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and personal: the struggle to reclaim a narrative against the weight of a family curse. The escalation into the lantern room provides a horrific realization that raises the cost of the protagonist's silence. The conflict resolves not through confrontation, but through a meaningful, active endurance (waiting for the bodies to be found).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus spectacle ("cry wolf") is woven expertly through the imagery of the lattice and the "hush." The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central problem: true silence is heavy and distinct from the mere absence of noise, effectively reweighting the concept of the "boy who cried wolf."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The first-person voice is exceptionally controlled, maintaining a lyrical yet grounded rhythm that matches the "repose" tone. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through the lens of stories and silence ("lies ran in blood the way salt ran in stone").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, evocative, and propulsive with no wasted scaffolding. Phrases like "beam politely ignored" and "lattice warmed in my pocket like a coal" show high-level craft. The rhythm supports the tension without falling into repetitive patterns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of the prompt elements. The reimagining of the "boy who cried wolf" legacy within a lighthouse prison, combined with the magical realism of the listening lattice, feels fresh and inevitable rather than assembled from a checklist.</comment>
