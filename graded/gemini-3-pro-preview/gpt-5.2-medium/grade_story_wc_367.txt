<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "storm herald" persona is vivid and the interplay between accidental prophecy and intentional guidance drives the narrative effectively. However, the protagonist's interiority occasionally drifts into stylized abstraction ("chill of accident," "shadowed elation") rather than grounded emotion. The interaction with the mayor feels summary-heavy, distancing the reader from the relational cost of the protagonist's dangerous gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a magical inciting incident to a resourceful climax using the newspaper cutouts. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the town is saved, but the dangerous compulsion to laugh/prophesy remains, charging the final routine with tension. The transition from prophecy to the specific mechanics of the "crawling" shadows relies slightly on poetic logic over causal clarity, but it fits the genre.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "emerald lighthouse" and the "glass lantern wick" are rendered with tactile, luminous specificity that anchors the magical realism. The atmosphere of a post-print, weather-dependent coast is established quickly and effectively. Broader spatial geography of the town is somewhat generic ("low streets," "bluff"), but the immediate setting of the lantern room is excellent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (survival of the town), and the protagonist exercises distinct agency by turning a destructive accident into a constructive warning. The climax, while clever, resolves somewhat smoothly through the shadow-puppet mechanism; the "struggle" is intellectual/artistic rather than a visceral test of limits. The final beat successfully reweights the stakes by highlighting the danger of the protagonist's addiction to the "rising joy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central theme—transforming the "ancient shadows" of old media into a new signal for the future—is resonant and well-executed through the newspaper motif. The "wet ink" scent as a proxy for hope is a lovely, specific detail. The thematic articulation becomes slightly didactic near the end ("turning yesterday's paper into tomorrow's signal"), but the core concept lands with weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The modulation between the mechanical details of the lighthouse and the magical elements of the laughter is handled smoothly. The distance feels intentional, positioning the narrator as a somewhat detached sentinel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rich, with striking imagery ("drank flame," "river in glass"). However, there is a tendency toward metaphor stacking ("jokes landed like dropped coins," "clouds... like congregants") and adjective-noun pairings ("shadowed elation") that occasionally slows momentum. The writing is high-quality but borders on ornate in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic technological regression with magical realism is fresh and engaging. The specific mechanism of using newspaper cutouts inside a glass wick to broadcast shadow-warnings is a highly original image that successfully marries the prompt elements into a singular, memorable aesthetic.</comment>
