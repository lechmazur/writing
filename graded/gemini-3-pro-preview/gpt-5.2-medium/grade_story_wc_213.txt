<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris displays strong agency, driving the resolution through technical competence and a distinct moral choice. Her motivation to "favor listening" is effectively dramatized in her actions, though the repetition of the label "credibly curious" twice feels like a forced tell rather than organic characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal structure is impeccable; the glue constraint creates a ticking clock that dovetails perfectly with the storm's arrival. The closure is a decisive, on-page reconfiguration of the warning system with clear risk (defying the Office) and validated outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the specific microclimate details (ice needles, updrafts) are essential tools for the protagonist's solution. The sanctuary's physical positioning above the clouds justifies the plot mechanics seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established between the Office's fear of lawsuits and the protagonist's desire for effective warning. The pressure escalates naturally with the approach of zero hour, forcing a binary choice that Maris resolves with significant professional risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "listening over noise" is tightly integrated into the plot mechanism and the final resolution. The ending creates a resonant conceptual repricing where the warning acts as a teacher rather than a panic inducer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and confident, blending technical observation with lyrical description. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Maris's professional worldview, though the repetition of prompt phrases creates slight textural ripples.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and precise ("dark river through the rafters"), but integration of required elements creates visible scaffolding. The redundancy in "glued in place fully set, after the glue dries" and the repetition of "credibly curious" as a modifier disrupt the otherwise high-quality line craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a monastic setting with technical weather science offers a fresh perspective on the storm trope. The specific solution—tuning a vane to microclimates—feels ingenious and grounded in the established world logic.</comment>
