<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on adjective-labeling ("wistfully pragmatic," "careful people") rather than revealing traits through friction or difficult choices. Mara's motivation ("fear without a task") is compelling but resolved too easily by immediate agreement, lacking the internal resistance or contradiction required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the "bitting gauge" provides a solid causal anchor, but the climax relies on a convenient, low-stakes application of Mara's gardening skills established just prior. The closure (mirrors in the stairwell) is a resonant image that successfully reconfigures the opening state, though the path there lacks significant reversals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the "bitting gauge tooth" and "fire escape garden" grounding the lyrical tone in specific, tactile reality. The setting actively participates in the solution (moonlight, stairwell angles), though some descriptions lean slightly into standard "lit mag" atmospheric tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The external stakes (smugglers) remain abstract and distant, resolved instantly by a radio call without on-page confrontation or adaptation. The protagonist faces no narrowing of options or significant trade-offs; the plan works on the first try, resulting in a flat escalation curve despite the suggested danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of "tending" applied to safety is coherent and touching, but the text explicitly explains its own meaning ("understands her garden was practice for this kind of saving"). The final image of the mirrors successfully anchors the theme in a physical change, earning a solid score despite the didactic middle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a lyrical, reflective tone appropriate for the content. However, the repetition of specific phrases ("quivering hush," "luminous") and a tendency toward preciousness ("instill courage in her ribcage") detracts slightly from the authority of the narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose has a pleasing rhythm but suffers from repetitive diction (multiple uses of "luminous," "moonlight," "hush") and some cliché phrasing ("bones in the moonlight," "spill of silver"). The required phrase "quivering hush" appears twice, drawing attention to itself as an artifact rather than organic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit—a fire escape gardener helping a lockmaster—is fresh and inventive, elevating the story above standard vignette fare. This unique synthesis of roles provides a strong foundation, even if the execution leans on safer, low-conflict narrative choices.</comment>
