<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct presence with a specific skill set, and the interaction with the boy reveals her values under pressure. However, traits like "feisty" are explicitly labeled ("Her feisty grumble was endearing even to herself") rather than dramatized, and the interiority occasionally slips into explanatory exposition about her motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and efficient, moving from the breach to a specific repair task that tests the protagonist's resolve. Closure is strong: the girl's reconfiguration of the ribbon's purpose creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that answers the "deciduous vow" premise with a fresh image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "lush orchard" within the cathedral is vivid and atmospheric ("apples glowing where candles once hung"). Crucially, the setting's constraints (lack of proper tools) force the protagonist to improvise, integrating world details directly into the central action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—professional ban versus personal integrity—and the boy’s challenge ("adults broke them first") effectively escalates the pressure. The resolution is earned through the physical act of mending, though the opposition remains somewhat static after the initial confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily didactic. The concept of "deciduous vows" is explicitly defined for the reader ("promises renewed by shedding"), and the ending moralizes ("until their generation could teach hers what faith meant") rather than letting the resonance emerge solely from the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent fable-like quality that suits the magical realism of the quartz-eye mender. While generally controlled, the narrative distance occasionally collapses into self-congratulatory telling ("endearing even to herself") which disrupts the immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-density and evocative ("contract snapped like dry twigs," "blue as river shade"). The score is held back by a few moments of expository filtering ("Mira realized," "Mira recognized") and the forced insertion of prompt phrases that read as labels rather than organic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The specific profession of "quartz-eye mender" combined with the cathedral-orchard setting creates a fresh, memorable aesthetic. The "gruff mentor heals cynical child" dynamic is familiar, but the specific execution and the "deciduous vow" metaphor elevate it.</comment>
