<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lena is drawn with competence and specific traits ("map framer," "methodically curious"), but lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses under pressure. Her shift from "guarded kindness" to "openness" is summarized rather than dramatized through difficult choices, and she faces no significant personal cost for her empathy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong, linking the video evidence effectively to the physical discovery at the henge. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the chapel’s purpose, though the resolution feels slightly frictionless, solving the mystery with linear efficiency rather than complex negotiation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting details are vivid and functional, particularly the "missing edge" of the map inked directly onto the henge stone, which grounds the magical premise in tangible geography. This specific physical constraint guides the narrative path effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely conceptual; while the intellectual puzzle is engaging, the protagonist faces no active opposition or visceral risk. The escalation is linear investigation without a moment where failure feels possible or the price of success becomes painful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of hearing the silenced is coherent but heavily externalized through explicit summary ("she understood the whisper was the chapel keeping company...") rather than subtext. The ending "FOR THOSE WHO WERE QUIET" moralizes the resolution, reducing the potential for interpretive resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric control that suits the gothic/mystery tone. The shift into the archivist’s perspective via the video analysis is handled smoothly without breaking the POV anchor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose flows with a suitable rhythm, though occasional compound adjectives lack hyphens ("rain scoured," "side by side") and some imagery feels slightly ornamental ("colors washed to pale bones"). The density is good, but expository phrasing in the resolution drags the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The central conceit of a map framer acting as a medium for geographic memory is fresh and specific. While the "ghosts want to be heard" arc is a standard trope, the physical execution via the stone map and video comparison elevates the material.</comment>
