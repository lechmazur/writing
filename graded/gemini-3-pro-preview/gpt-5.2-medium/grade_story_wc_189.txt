<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara is a deeply realized protagonist; her secret defiance (hiding jarred copies) contrasts beautifully with her outward role as a soothing mediator for Iven. This internal contradiction adds necessary grit to her character, preventing her from becoming purely saintly, and her choice to "teach" him rather than fight is earned by her established observational habit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and distinct, using the "tangential approach" as both a magical mechanic and a conversational tactic to turn the beat. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor transforms from doom to passage, and the move north is a decisive action with the felt cost of abandoning the ancestral grotto.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is inextricable from the plot; the "black rock like a book" and the behavior of the tide explicitly constrain the characters' time and options. The sensory details—dripstone, the cold jade, the shimmer of the pool—are vivid and filter strictly through Mara's chronicler persona.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stakes are effectively braided: the immediate relational conflict with Iven mirrors the looming existential threat of the harbor. The "foreseeing" beat escalates pressure by confirming the harbor's inevitability, forcing a pivot from resistance to adaptation, though the off-stage Council relies slightly on Iven as a proxy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The final image of waves erasing footprints while leaving the beach unchanged is a powerful, non-literal resonance of the "leaving and staying" theme. The score is held back only slightly by the dialogue line "change is not an ending," which articulates the thesis a bit too explicitly, though it functions well rhetorically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice possesses a distinct, lyrical authority that fits the "chronicler" archetype without becoming distant. The perceptual signature is strong—Mara interprets silence as having "edges" and time as having "texture"—maintaining a consistent interiority throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality figurative language like "coral that cuts while it builds" and "opened the black rock like a book." The rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing during the "syrup" moment of the charm and flowing during the release, with no visible artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a tidal-pool setting with a tactile metaphysics of time ("texture") is fresh and intellectually engaging. The story takes a risk by resolving a political threat through a philosophical reframing, but earns it through the specific mechanics of the jade cicada.</comment>
