<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jun’s transformation from ambition to service is distinct and earned through the on-page struggle with the bloom's reality. Her specific family custom and sensory traits are not just ornamentation but drive her micro-choices and the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is seamless, with the "doodling on wrapping paper" acting as a clever causal pivot that unlocks the forbidden garden. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist gains her desire by accepting a constraint (service/reporting).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The olfactory landscape of Larkroot is vivid and functional, acting as a compass for the protagonist. The environment exerts genuine pressure on the plot, specifically the "reek" of the bloom serving as the climactic test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and the escalation during the bloom scene is visceral. The conflict shifts effectively from external (wardens) to internal/environmental (endurance of the stench), though the initial rejection by the wardens feels slightly standard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "stink and grace"—finding serenity in the necessary decay—is beautifully integrated into the plot mechanics. The ending resonates without preaching, anchoring the abstract "undercurrent of wisdom" in the concrete action of the spiral drawing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and tightly filtered through Jun’s sensory perceptions. The shift in tone during the bloom effectively conveys the overwhelm without breaking the established "wildflower hush" container.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush and dense with imagery ("wave of graves and ripe pears"), supporting the sensory focus. A minor stumble with the clunky phrasing "olfactorily sensitive" in the opening paragraph disrupts the otherwise smooth lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corpse flower's biology with a village's sanitation and a herbalist's trade is fresh and compelling. The specific cultural detail of the wrapping paper maps adds a layer of unique ingenuity.</comment>
