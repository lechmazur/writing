<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kestrel is a distinct, high-concept protagonist, but her "habit of borrowing personalities" is largely summarized rather than dramatized until the stranger's arrival. The internal cost of "coherence loss" is stated effectively but relies on exposition more than embodied struggle in the middle beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fable logic is coherent and the mechanism of "transposed empathy" drives the narrative cleanly to a resonant closure. The final image of the ledger acts as a strong Conceptual Repricing, though the Council conflict is resolved through summary rather than scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Occupational details (chase, sort, vellum) ground the fantastical premise with specific, tactile constraints. The "topaz dust" and "vanishing stars" create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that supports the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined, but the escalation suffers from a summarized middle beat where the Council auditors are defeated in a sentence. The pressure is intellectual and atmospheric rather than viscerally dramatized in that key conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor of emotion-as-math is powerful and realized beautifully in the ledger entries. However, the final sentence explicitly articulates the theme ("empathy was not a gift but a transformation"), flattening the subtextual resonance of the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable mode perfectly. The POV filters the world strictly through Kestrel's trade, maintaining distance control even during the surreal transfers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense and polished, with high-quality imagery ("vellum washed with her own breath") and strong rhythmic control. The writing manages complex abstract concepts without losing momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics, matrix algebra, and empathy is highly original and executes a fresh conceptual turn. The story commits fully to its unique premise, though the rating is capped by the summary nature of the middle conflict.</comment>
