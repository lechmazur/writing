<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is rendered with exceptional specificity; her shift from performing a rehearsed apology to inhabiting the raw "moment before" is earned through concrete on-page struggle (tearing the letter, holding the shard). The choice to stay three nights demonstrates agency and endurance that charges the final reconciliation with earned weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pivot from "back" to "before" is a brilliant Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes the narrative goal from impossible time-travel to moral courage. The arrival of the brother borders on convenient coincidence—resolving the separation without an active external signal from Mara—but fits the fable-like logic and serves as the necessary test for her crystallized internal state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting acts as an antagonist and a guide; the condensation messages and singing roots create a specific, pressurized environment that forces the protagonist's introspection. The healing of the stone in the moonlight is a perfect micro-setting detail that externalizes the internal arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as relational and internal, deepening significantly when the spirits reject the "easy fiction" of the first letter. The cost is felt in the "blood rose" and the three days of waiting, ensuring the final release of tension feels paid for rather than gifted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The distinction between "unsent" as a state of paper versus a state of courage is a profound thematic insight that emerges organically from the action. The story successfully resists a simple "love conquers all" moral in favor of a complex exploration of preparation and timing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly attuned to the magical realism mode, maintaining a consistent elevated register. The narrative distance is managed well, keeping close to Mara’s emotional experience while allowing the atmospheric details to breathe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with standout lines like "knitting its jagged edge smooth as a tongue learning gentleness." A minor deduction for the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase "fierce tenderness," which reads slightly as a scaffold artifact rather than a natural recurrance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the prompt elements into a fresh, non-obvious narrative; the mechanism of the gargoyle shard remembering the night and healing in moonlight provides a unique, tangible metaphor for the psychological work of apology.</comment>
