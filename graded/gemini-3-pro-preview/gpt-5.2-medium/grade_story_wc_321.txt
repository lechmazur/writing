<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lina demonstrates strong agency and competence, particularly in using her trade skills to resolve the crisis. However, her core motivation (“so nobody had to disappear alone”) is explicitly stated in summary rather than dramatized through prior specific loss or interaction, limiting emotional weight. The "workman's nod" at the climax is an excellent, character-specific beat that grounds the surrealism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from the uncanny slipping to a decisive resolution. The dream logic of stitching time via radio codes works within the established tone, though the transition to the grotto feels somewhat compressed. Closure lands well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, merging the timelines with a clear sense of restored order.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a strength, blending nautical grit with surreal distortion (“brass housings,” “blue salt light”). The specific imagery of the sideways clocks and the star chart effectively anchors the magical realism in the physical world. The grotto description is vivid, though it leans slightly on standard spectral tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (vanishing commuters) and pressure escalates logically to the grotto sequence. While the resolution is earned through Lina's skill, the "fear in her throat" is told rather than shown in the mechanics of the solution, which proceeds relatively smoothly. The cost is conceptual—acceptance of the "now"—rather than a visceral price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The themes of transience and connection are present but undercut by explicit labeling using prompt phrases (“resiliently positive,” “permanent transient”). Subtext suffers when the narrative overtly diagnoses the protagonist's state and the metaphysical mechanics (“seam between parallel timelines”) instead of allowing meaning to emerge purely from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical but grounded tone appropriate for the setting. Interiority remains strictly bound to Lina’s perspective, effectively filtering the surreal events through her workmanlike worldview without head-hopping or breaks in distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm, but the repetition of specific prompt phrases (“resiliently positive,” “permanent transient”) as adjectival labels acts as visible scaffolding. Some metaphorical phrasing (“weighed like a promise”) leans toward density at the expense of precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of using a ferry schedule and radio codes to stitch time is a fresh, specific synthesis of setting and plot. The refusal of a sentimental hug between the selves in favor of a professional nod is a distinct, original choice that avoids cliché and elevates the ending.</comment>
