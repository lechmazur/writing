<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is distinct and her motivation to understand her father is clear, but her interiority often feels filtered through abstract thematic summary rather than embodied emotion. The repetition of the awkward prompt phrase "featherly determined" creates a jarring, artificial note in her characterization. While her choice to jump is motivated, the "ethical" nature of the risk feels intellectualized rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, following a clear scavenger-hunt structure that leads logically to the climax. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Mira accepts the distance as a form of connection. However, relying on a written message to explicitly explain the story's logic ("sacred thresholds exist where...") weakens the dramatic impact of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element; the drifting prism terraces and the wind-aligned corridors are vivid, original, and functionally constrain the action. The environment actively shapes the plot, dictating the timing of the jump. The "fractured hush" atmosphere is palpable and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are personal and clear, and the seven-minute window creates a functional ticking clock for the climax. However, the conflict is low-pressure; the "storms" are backstory, and the obstacles are overcome with smooth competence rather than struggle. The protagonist succeeds by waiting and intuiting, which keeps the narrative tension mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of "necessary distances" is central but handled heavily; the story relies on a "sermonizing ending" where the father's note explicitly defines the theme ("sacred thresholds exist where..."). This reduces subtextual resonance, turning the ending into a direct statement of the premise rather than an emergent realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, matching the "hushed" city concept well. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hush fracture," "compass letters") that distances the reader. The forced inclusion of the prompt phrase "featherly determined" disrupts the narrative flow and voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose has moments of beauty but suffers from overwrought metaphors ("leaps no wider than a human promise") that obscure physical reality. The non-standard adverb "featherly" is used twice, creating a noticeable artifact that breaks immersion. The rhythm is generally good, but the density of abstract imagery sometimes slows the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "butterfly effect" with floating glass terraces over a corn maze is a fresh, imaginative reconfiguration of the prompt elements. The world-building feels specific and original. The emotional core—a daughter chasing a father's architectural philosophy—adds depth to the high-concept setting.</comment>
