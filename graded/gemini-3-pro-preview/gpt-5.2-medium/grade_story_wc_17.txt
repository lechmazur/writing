<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s agency is clear, culminating in a decisive professional transgression to protect the archive. However, her internal state at the climax is summarized ("legacy's burden settled on her chest") rather than dramatized through visceral reaction, which intellectualizes the emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The closure—a lie to authority to preserve dignity—is impactful and well-earned. The mid-story relies heavily on the "found diary" trope to deliver exposition and mechanics, which stalls the active discovery process until the film strip is used.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and active, with details like "salt fog" and "soot" grounding the speculative elements. The environment constrains movement (collapsed entrance) and serves as the physical vessel for the story's central mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from mapping to ethical guardianship, pressurized effectively by the hovering drones. The conflict remains largely retrospective (reading/decoding) for the first half, lacking immediate opposition until the restoration team's intent becomes the antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of ethical memory—private grief vs. public consumption—is nuanced and deeply integrated. The ending creates a resonant reconfiguration of the "echoes" from data points to protected dreams without resorting to a simple moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, effectively blending technical precision ("corridor echo cartographer") with melancholic lyricism. The POV remains stable, though the attribute "sensitively perceptive" is delivered as a label rather than an organic observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high and imagery is evocative ("green curtain," "dreaming aloud"). The use of abstract summaries for emotional beats ("legacy's burden") slightly weakens the otherwise tactile line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic cartography and architecture designed to store memory as sound is highly original and imaginatively executed. It offers a fresh, specific synthesis of climate fiction and gothic memory tropes.</comment>
