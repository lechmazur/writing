<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist displays strong agency, making a sacrificial choice ("let the wave functions split me") that directly addresses the central problem. Motivation is clear and poignant, though the emotional interiority is slightly subordinated to the high-concept mechanics. The "dreamless" state serves as an effective, consistent constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands with the lasting cost of the protagonist's fractured existence. The climax—auditors retreating merely because they "heard" the history—feels slightly convenient conceptually compared to the gritty mechanical setup, but causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the "divergent archive" and "glowing dune" actively constrain and shape the protagonist's tactics. Sensory details like "smelled green in one branch" and the "glowing dune in bloom" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that functions as a character itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly defined (preservation of history vs. profitable collapse). Escalation works well through the protagonist's transformation. The external opposition (auditors) lacks tactical bite, folding quickly to a thematic appeal, which slightly softens the final pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme is tightly woven into the narrative mechanics; the "wave function" splitting perfectly serves the concept of preserving divergent histories. The ending resonates strongly, offering a non-literal answer to the problem of loss and erasure without resorting to a simple moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently controlled, effectively blending sci-fi concepts with a mythic tone. The "fractured lullaby" quality is maintained throughout without slipping into exposition or breaking the mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Imagery is evocative ("dawn had gotten trapped under skin"). Minor reliance on filter-like phrasing ("I understood," "I heard") is present but unobtrusive; the rhythm successfully supports the story's dreamlike logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of quantum mechanics and fantasy tropes within a "freight guard" aesthetic. The concept of a "divergent archive" stored in a dune is imaginative, and the execution feels specific and earned rather than derivative.</comment>
