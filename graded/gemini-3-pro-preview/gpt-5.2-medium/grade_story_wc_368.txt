<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maru’s internal conflict—between the dye master’s habit of control and the donor’s legacy of letting go—is articulate and moving. The shift from wanting to "chase light" to becoming the illuminator is earned through the narrative arc. Motivation is clear, though the emotional resistance during the middle quest phase is summarized rather than fully dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative structure functions as a compressed parable, using a montage for the three-day search that successfully bridges the inciting incident to the climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned, with the release of the dye serving as a concrete action sealing the internal change. The timeline compression is handled well, though it distances the reader slightly from the physical struggle of the search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot mechanics; the prisms, sun trails, and floating architecture are not just backdrop but the tools required to unlock the story's secrets. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices (waiting for light, finding the underside), charging the final image with specific, tangible atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal and thematic, which works for this length, but the external obstacles are low-resistance (following a map without active opposition). While the cost is paid in the surrender of the dye and the ego, the "scavenger hunt" middle section lacks acute pressure or the risk of failure until the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The thematic subversion of "magnetizing stories" versus "illuminating others" is handled with sophistication and lands a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The concept of "iridescent caution" evolves from a medical warning to a moral philosophy without feeling heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively blending the technical language of a dye master with the mystical elements of the setting. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through "stains," "threads," and "sutures," maintaining a coherent distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is lush and high-density, with evocative phrasing like "patient lantern" and "sutures became honest scar." It occasionally leans on filter verbs ("I began to understand," "I realized") to summarize internal states that could be sharper, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a heart transplant narrative with a fantasy dye-master profession and sun-alignment mechanics creates a fresh, specific vision. The floating tea house is a familiar trope, but its integration with the light-map mechanic revitalizes it.</comment>
