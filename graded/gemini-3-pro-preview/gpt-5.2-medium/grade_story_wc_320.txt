<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara is a highly competent protagonist whose internal drive ("find the beginning in every ending") perfectly motivates her external actions. The contradiction between her role as a preserver and her choice to dismantle the mast creates a sophisticated, earned resolution. Her agency is absolute, driving the plot from the tuning to the final physical labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Accumulative-to-Causal arc, moving from tuning static to executing a blueprint. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change—the city is physically altered and repurposed—with the cost of labor and the loss of the mast clearly paid on the page. The pacing is tight, with the discovery of the signal acting as a natural pivot point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral, acting as both a physical constraint (swaying catwalks, the gorge) and a thematic scaffold. The imagery of the "abandoned radio tower city" is vivid and sustained, charging the final action where the mast is dropped into the specific geography of the gorge. The sensory details (ozone, humming bolts) ground the fantasy elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (the city is to be scrapped) and escalated through the pressure of the perigee and the discovery of the signal. While the opposition is largely environmental and entropic rather than antagonistic, the physical cost ("sore hands") and the irreversible choice to dismantle the tower provide sufficient weight to the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming authority (broadcasting) into receptivity (listening) is beautifully woven into the plot mechanics. The ending resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of how to begin again: by removing the "arrogance" of the tallest mast. The final image of the villages learning to answer the sky perfectly caps the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "fantasy practicality" tone throughout. Phrases like "lighter by one arrogance" and "cadence of orbits" establish a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical precision with mythic weight. The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying close to Mara’s interpretative mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with high information density and no scaffold loops. The metaphorical language ("shard of hush," "surrendered spear") is evocative without becoming purple, serving the story's atmospheric needs. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the "practical cadence" mentioned in the text, accelerating effectively during the dismantling sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a radio-tech aesthetic with magical realism elements (weather charms, Hollywood star fragment) creates a fresh, specific world. The concept of "tuning" a city by dismantling its loudest component is a novel and satisfying twist on the trope of salvaging lost technology.</comment>
