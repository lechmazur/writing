<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, proactive protagonist with clear motivation and agency. Her steadfastness is well-dramatized through her patience and method, and the final choice to violate the truce creates visible cost. The internal landscape ("less like bravery and more like habit") adds specific, character-bound depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with clear causality and a defined inciting set of circumstances. However, the explicit labeling of "First false start" and "Second false start" acts as visible scaffolding that momentarily distances the reader. The ending logic relies slightly on the visual reveal of the badge to resolve the immediate scene, making the fob's role in the climax secondary (insurance) rather than primary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the rotting pier, the vibrations, and the tidal environment are not just atmospheric but integral to the plot's mechanics. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices (crabs, waves) and provides the medium (wood/vibration) for the solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly established early on. The escalation through the failed attempts effectively raises tension, though the mechanical enumeration of those attempts flattens the pressure slightly. The climax forces a distinct trade-off: violating the market's truce to save her father.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "trust breaking" is brilliantly physicalized through the acoustic mechanism of the watch fob. The concept of the "truce of hush" resonates well with the final shattering of silence. The ending image of the tide rinsing blood reinforces the cost of broken peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a gritty, atmospheric tone that suits the setting. Interiority is well-balanced with action, and the perspective remains firmly anchored in Mara's sensory experience throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is generally vivid with strong sensory details ("lanterns rocked like tired fireflies"). However, the use of explicit list-like transitions ("First false start...", "Second false start...") triggers a scaffold penalty, creating a checklist feel that disrupts the otherwise immersive flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a pirate market with acoustic espionage via a wax-filled fob is highly original and specific. The mechanical ingenuity of the solution feels fresh and inevitable within the established world logic.</comment>
