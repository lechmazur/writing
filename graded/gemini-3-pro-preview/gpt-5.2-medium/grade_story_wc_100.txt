<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marek is a distinct, weary focalizer whose professional history ("undertaker for a coast that has no coast") deeply informs his perception. The "inadvertently stubborn" trait is not just a label but the engine of the plot, driving him past the point of safety (bleeding ears) to achieve a resonant, character-specific goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting arrival to a decisive, cost-laden action (sacrificing air/safety to power the machine). While the mechanics of using breath and a lens to transmute sound into light rely on dream logic, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "chased stillness" is pacified—lands with undeniable emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist; the "impossible spaces" and "drowned ribs" of the library actively constrain Marek's movement. The environment is not merely a backdrop but a physical pressure cooker that necessitates the story's specific surreal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and thematic (oblivion vs. memory), escalated by the visceral physical threat of the deep ("sea presses on my helmet"). The pressure remains coherent under a Hybrid lens, culminating in a choice that trades physical safety for metaphysical resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "giving rest a permanent address" is woven tightly into the action, avoiding abstract moralizing in favor of concrete labor (wiring, diving, breathing). The finding of his own catalog card adds a layer of personal mortality that deepens the final act of preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, melancholic, and textured, perfectly matching the surreal gothic tone. The narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader anchored in Marek's sensory experience ("smelling of lamp oil and storms") while navigating the impossible geometry of the library.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in every line ("stone arches lean like drowned ribs"). The recurring motif of "chased stillness" is handled with rhythmic precision, evolving from an atmospheric threat to a pacified companion at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of an underwater post-apocalyptic setting with the bureaucratization of death is fresh and compelling. The synesthetic conceit of the lens focusing sound into light is a bold, imaginative leap that feels earned within the story's specific reality.</comment>
