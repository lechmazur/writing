<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a highly competent protagonist whose internal state (trembling with hope, not fear) provides a fresh, specific emotional anchor. The relationship with Rolen is efficiently sketched through action and silence, creating a believable "sly" alliance. The "ingenious machinist" trait is substantiated by her use of tools to solve a social problem.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from a public impasse to a private discovery and back to public resolution. The closure (Accord signed via technical compromise) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the factional conflict. The forensic analysis beat is slightly convenient for a machinist's toolkit but is handled swiftly enough to maintain momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, satisfying the 9+ criterion where the environment constrains choice or enables action. The volcanic heat vent is not just atmospheric but is the precise tool used to reveal the invisible ink, merging setting with the solution. The acoustics of the volcano also motivate the scene's location.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (mills vs. wetlands) and escalated by the public pressure of the council. The resolution is earned through Mara's technical translation of the coded message, though the speed at which the factions accept the compromise feels slightly idealized ("single hush"). The "pulse gate" solution grounds the compromise in credible engineering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "measured kindness" and engineering as compassion is woven beautifully through the narrative. The surveyor's chain serves as a perfect objective correlative for bridging the divide between rigid numbers and organic needs. The ending resonates without becoming overly moralistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, filtering the world through Mara's analytical yet empathetic perspective ("dappled resolve," "living infrastructure"). The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping Rolen's interiority opaque until his actions reveal his intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative and polished ("pale threads of blue... as if a map had been pulled through glue"). There is a slight drag in momentum during the explanation of the chemical analysis ("By analyzing... she could tell... because..."), which reads a bit like an expository insert to satisfy the prompt requirement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a dormant volcano setting with hydraulic engineering politics creates a fresh, specific scenario. The use of a surveyor's chain as a decryption device is an ingenious twist on the standard "hidden message" trope.</comment>
