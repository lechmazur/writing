<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is functional and their motivation is clear, but it is stated explicitly ("That was my obsession") rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. The "retrocognitive" ability serves primarily as an expository device to deliver backstory and codes, feeling like a convenience rather than a deeply integrated trait that creates friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The structure is coherent, but the resolution suffers from "symmetric satisfaction"—the world answers the protagonist's hope immediately and perfectly without exacting a visible cost. The arrival of the caravan by dawn, timed exactly with the signal, feels convenient and lowers the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "glass humming pavilion" and "shard of hush" create a distinct, immersive sensory reality. Specific details like the "tremor in the old fuel flame" and the "salt flats" effectively ground the high-concept elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conflict is largely procedural (aligning the device) rather than adversarial or internal. The "shard of hush" acts as a magical key that solves the central mechanical problem without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in low dramatic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered via direct assertion ("prove that coincidences have meaning") and a moralizing conclusion ("some accidents are invitations"). The resonance is limited by the lack of ambiguity or counter-argument; the universe simply validates the protagonist's worldview.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like atmosphere ("sound folded inward"). Narrative distance is stable, though the tone occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("thistle-blown hope").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("combed its ribs," "stitched the sky"). The insertion of the specific phrase "thistle-blown hope" feels slightly forced within its sentence, but otherwise, the prose is dense and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of a lonely beacon keeper in a post-apocalyptic wasteland is a familiar trope. While the "hush shard" and "retrocognition" add specific flavor, the narrative arc follows a standard path to validation without subverting genre expectations or taking structural risks.</comment>
