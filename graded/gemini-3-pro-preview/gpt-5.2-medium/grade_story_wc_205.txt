<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Len’s transition from "defunct relic" to "unwilling curator" is earned through specific, motivated choices rooted in his past. The "poet's habit" trait is functionally integrated into his perception and the final resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, utilizing the "visible time" mechanic effectively to solve the mystery. The shift to summary for the final exhibition ("Third Act") slightly distances the reader from the moment of closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; "visible time" acts as both obstacle and tool (the map projection). The "baroque asteroid" aesthetic permeates the voice and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and personal, with the storm providing necessary physical pressure to the intellectual debate. The resolution forces a meaningful trade-off for both factions, though the opposition remains off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of fragmentation as honesty is powerfully executed through the shard and mirror motifs. The final image of the "broken vase" projection offers a resonant Conceptual Repricing of the conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, matching the "poet" protagonist. The tone ("burnished sorrow") is well-sustained without becoming monotonous.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("striking the mirrors like thrown coins"), though the climax relies on indirect discourse ("Len confessed...") which dampens the immediacy of the pivotal negotiation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of archaeological tropes and time mechanics. The "visible time" concept is used ingeniously to resolve the central dispute through projection rather than simple discovery.</comment>
