<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lio is a compelling protagonist whose desire to remain "seldom heard" creates a distinct, paradoxical motivation that drives the plot. His internal conflict—wanting to be heard without turning his voice into currency—is sophisticated and pays off beautifully in the final choice to remain a "carrier." The empathy for the ghost is grounded in shared traits, making their interaction feel inevitable rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the "space between lightning and thunder" as a natural ticking clock that forces action. The pivot from "resurrection" to "routing" serves as an excellent Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the goal and satisfying the closure requirement with deep resonance. The ending feels earned and final, resolving the immediate tension while leaving the world changed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot mechanism; the verticality (courtyard above, city below) is essential for the "graffiti as message" concept to work. The "flower press bolt plate" is a standout micro-setting element that grounds the magical realism in tactile, specific engineering. The atmosphere of "misty courtyard" and "storm metal" is vivid and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally with the approaching storm. The conflict is internal (Lio's reluctance) and external (the ghost's panic/time limit), braiding together to force a meaningful decision. The cost is subtle but felt—an Earned Stasis where Lio reaffirms his path of anonymity and service over fame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The thematic distinction between "resurrection" (ego/return) and "routing" (connection/utility) is profound and elegantly executed. The story handles complex ideas about art, currency, and communication without didacticism. The final image of readers finding their own needs in the graffiti perfectly lands the theme of shared, anonymous burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the "tinkersong" aesthetic. Phrasing like "ghost in code with no throat" and "driftingly alert" establishes a consistent, elevated tone. The POV remains firmly with Lio until the final sentence, where the slight zoom-out to the city below feels like a natural expansion of the song's reach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffolding artifacts. The line "time narrow to the space between lightning and thunder" is exceptional, instantly establishing the stakes and atmosphere. Imagery is fresh and specific, avoiding cliché while maintaining a smooth rhythmic flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of disparate elements—botany tools, steampunk gears, graffiti, and coding—creates a unique and cohesive magic system. The concept of using a bolt plate as a musical stave for graffiti is highly inventive. The story avoids standard tropes of "ghost wants peace" by pivoting to the more specific "ghost wants routing."</comment>
