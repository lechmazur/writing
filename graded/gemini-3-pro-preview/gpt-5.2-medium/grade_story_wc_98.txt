<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tavo is a distinct protagonist whose internal conflict—empiricism versus the necessity of surrender—drives the narrative. His transition from skeptic to participant is earned, with the loss of his "certainty" providing a legible cost at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, moving cleanly from the inciting incident to a ritualistic climax that feels strictly derived from the story's internal logic. The closure is a strong Decisive Change that resolves the plot while effectively altering the protagonist’s stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ridge is an active participant rather than static scenery; its specific mechanic of blooming in response to collective dreams constrains Tavo's investigation and guides the climax. This integration of setting into the causal chain is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The looming monsoon provides effective external pressure, creating a ticking clock that heightens the stakes of the fading memories. The climax successfully braids the internal struggle (the need for proof) with the external threat, resulting in a satisfying tightening of the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory is not merely a motif but the engine of the resolution; the final image of the tree composed of faces offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of proof. The concept fully reweights the protagonist's initial empirical worldview.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and confident, maintaining a mythic, fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Tavo’s "reality checker" worldview, filtering magic through his specific lens of measurement and doubt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, though there is a slight logical friction in Tavo claiming to distrust the elders' instruction to use dreams while immediately using a notebook of dreams as a "different instrument." Aside from this momentary stumble, the imagery and rhythm are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "fantasy reality checker" who uses empirical tools to test miracles is fresh and engaging. The story successfully synthesizes scientific skepticism with high-fantasy ritual, creating a unique and memorable narrative identity.</comment>
