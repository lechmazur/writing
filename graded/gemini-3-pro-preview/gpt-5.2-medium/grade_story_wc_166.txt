<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira's agency drives the narrative; she actively chooses the harder path (keeping the grief-binding shard) over easy release. The internal conflict between panic and dancer's discipline is embodied in the scene through the "seated dance," grounding the character's skills in the immediate crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Causal lens holds firmly; the release from the bench is earned by the completion of the verse and the mastery of the garden's rhythm. Closure arrives as a Decisive Change—fledging into a network of exiles—with the paid cost of the permanent tattoo and the binding to city grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting acts as an active antagonist; the "gentle, absolute gravity" constrains movement and forces the protagonist to adapt her primary skill (dancing) to survive. The sensory details ("voice like wet stone," "brine language") create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are effectively raised by the Keeper's bargain (freedom vs. painful memory). The physical cost (tattooing with brine and dust) and the conceptual cost (binding herself to the city's grief) are legible on the page, driving the escalation to a satisfying peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of transmuting nostalgia into art is handled with nuance, avoiding simple moralizing. The shift from "ban" to "contraband minerals" to "light" offers a resonant, non-literal resolution, though the final "fledging" metaphor is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently filtered through the "tide dancer" persona, using specific terminology (currents, mooring, fulcrum) to color the narration. The lyrical tone matches the magical realism well without drifting into purple prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and purposeful ("glittered like a trapped tide"). The integration of the prompt phrase "spontaneously anchored" is grammatically functional but creates a slight rhythmic bump; otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "nostalgia ban" trope with the specific mechanics of tide dancing and the gravity-bound garden feels fresh. The execution transforms the prompt elements into a cohesive, distinct narrative logic.</comment>
