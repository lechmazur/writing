<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris is a distinct, highly competent protagonist with a clear voice and backstory that anchors the stakes. However, her execution of the plan is nearly flawless; she lacks a dramatized internal flaw or a moment of genuine vulnerability that complicates her success, resulting in a lack of visible on-page cost for her victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong and the orientation is immediate, establishing the stakes and setting efficiently. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change that lands firmly, though the mechanics of the resolution (the prepared threads) feel slightly convenient, resembling a puzzle solution rather than a tactical adaptation under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is immersive and specific ("sifted salt," "calm knives"), effectively establishing the "alarming serenity" tone. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active constraint; the acoustics of the courtyard and the mechanism of the glass sanctuary directly shape the action and the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freedom vs. control) is clear, but the antagonist acts as a passive obstacle rather than an active threat, reducing tension. The protagonist wins without facing a significant trade-off or paying a felt price, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of silenced truth versus conformity is well-integrated into the "harvest of echoes" concept. The final image of the city meeting its own doubts in "startled birds" of sound offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, though phrases like "lullaby of conformity" lean a bit too heavily on telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a poetic distance that perfectly matches Maris's "chaste courtesan" persona. The elevated register supports the fairy-tale logic of the world without slipping into abstraction or breaking the point of view.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, with high sensory density ("unlace expectations," "pleased blindness"). A few metaphors approach overwriting ("grammar of the body," "lullaby of conformity"), but the overall texture is sophisticated and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" and the glass sanctuary form a fresh, specific magic system that serves the story well. The heist mechanic—using breath and light-threads to pick a lock of sound—is an imaginative synthesis of fantasy elements that avoids generic combat tropes.</comment>
