<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lina is consistent but functions primarily as a vessel for the plot's scavenger hunt rather than a character under pressure. Her interiority is summarized ("began to reckon") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The lack of active struggle or meaningful flaws results in a smooth, low-friction arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The story violates the short-form scope default by summarizing a season-long timeline rather than grounding the narrative in a continuous scene or tight shards. The climax relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, where the protagonist literally reads the thematic and plot resolution from the window glass, removing interpretive work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sensory details are vivid and specific ("soot-dark cathedral," "scratches on ice"), creating a strong atmospheric container. The "crypt vents" mechanism is a distinct and grounded world-building detail that successfully anchors the botanical mystery in physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Escalation is negligible; Lina faces no active opposition and pays no visible cost, simply waiting for the right lighting conditions to succeed. The stakes remain abstract curiosity, and the resolution feels gifted by the postcards rather than won through agency or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered didactically at the climax, with the window text explicitly stating the moral ("gentleness could be engineered") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. This over-articulation flattens the resonance, reducing the ending to a solved equation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, matching the "quietly driven" protagonist. However, the reliance on summary creates a distant narrative filter that keeps the reader observing Lina rather than inhabiting her immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and vivid, though it occasionally leans into ornamental description ("vivid enough to warm"). The reliance on filter verbs ("she noticed," "she saw," "she learned") during discovery beats distances the reader from the sensory immediacy of the revelations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central concept of the cathedral window functioning as a thermal map/botanical diagram is inventive and fresh. However, the "dead parent leaves a scavenger hunt of letters" frame is a familiar trope that lowers the overall ingenuity score.</comment>
