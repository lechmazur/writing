<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s internal pivot from rigid "preprocessing" to "kindled humility" is convincing and rooted in her scientific background. The shift is earned through the specific labor of the dust mapping, though Lupe functions more as a catalyst than a fully realized counterweight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative drive lens holds firmly, using the dust experiment to bridge the gap between abstract grief and concrete repair. The closure (a Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively, though the discovery of the structural rot via butterfly scales pushes the bounds of plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is exquisite and functional; the "slate light" and "humidity curled the torn leaves" create a tangible atmosphere that constrains the protagonist's tools. The butterfly dust acting as "star matter" brilliantly connects the setting to the character’s backstory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and quiet; while the rot introduces a physical clock, the tension relies heavily on Mara's psychological adjustment. The escalation is consistent with the accumulative lens, though external pressure remains mild.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis of stellar decay and earthly rot is profound, but the ending stumbles into a "Thematic Echo." Mara explicitly articulating the thesis ("change was not a headline but an accumulation") in the final lines flattens the resonance into a lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a disciplined, intelligent control, blending scientific lexicon ("accretion," "pulsar glitches") with lyrical observation without breaking character. The perspective feels distinct and authoritative throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic ("worried it down, plank by plank"), with high information density and no scaffold loops. The metaphors are purposeful, though "leaves... exhaling a small apology" borders on the precious.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-energy physics concepts with a quiet greenhouse restoration offers a fresh, specific angle on the post-disaster trope. The central image of mapping drafts with butterfly wings is memorable and inventive.</comment>
