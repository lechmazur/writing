<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict (panic vs. the borrowed calm) is compelling, and the motivation to save the sister drives the narrative effectively. However, the mechanism of the "borrowed heartbeat" is slightly ambiguous regarding its physical necessity versus its emotional utility, which softens the stakes of renouncing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change, but the causality relies heavily on the mirror revealing a perfect solution where doing the "right thing" yields no external loss. The lack of a difficult trade-off (the protagonist gains both the boy's life and the sister's survival by giving up a crutch) reduces the narrative tension and cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "prism parapet" and "rainlight" grounding the magical elements in sensory reality. The environment actively supports the "mirage" concept, though some similes ("city like a wet book") feel slightly strained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are high, but the central dilemma is de-risked by the mirror's revelation that keeping the heartbeat leads to failure anyway. This alignment of moral duty and tactical success removes the potential for a more agonizing, high-cost choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of choosing possibilities and the necessity of grace is well-integrated and resonant. The connection between the "borrowed" nature of the pulse and the "truth worth keeping" creates a coherent thematic arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly melancholic tone that suits the magical realism. The perspective remains stable, though the transition from the terrace to the hospital feels a bit rushed in the final summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with evocative imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting (e.g., "calm as a pond that knows stones will sink"). The required phrase "perceptively calm" reads awkwardly and appears to be a forced inclusion that disrupts the otherwise smooth flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a "mirage painter" and "coded lullabies" offers a fresh, imaginative take on the oracle archetype. The synthesis of medical drama with high fantasy elements is handled with creativity.</comment>
