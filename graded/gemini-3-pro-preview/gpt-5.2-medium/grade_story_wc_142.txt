<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation and traits are established through explicit authorial labels ("orderly intuitive," "loyalties split like the tide") rather than dramatized friction or subtext. Internal conflict is summarized as a static state ("owed the Council... owed the performers") instead of being rendered through simultaneous contradictory impulses in a specific scene. The protagonist's emotions are named ("hope," "panic," "desperation") rather than embodied in action or physical response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative operates as a high-level synopsis or fable-like summary rather than a dramatized story, relying on "and-then" sequencing that spans weeks without a continuous scene window. The resolution is unearned and convenient; the antagonist's immediate capitulation upon seeing the moving city ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum") functions as a "soft reset" that dissolves the conflict without genuine struggle or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central concept of the raft city is vivid and specifically constrains the plot mechanics, offering a strong foundation for the story's logic. However, sensory details often appear in list form ("ferris wheel and food raft," "blue spiral," "red swallow") typical of summary, preventing the immersive, lived-in atmosphere required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>While the stakes (cultural erasure vs. privatization) are clear, the conflict is resolved through an "explain-everything" ending where the antagonist abandons his goal because of a sudden thematic realization. This lack of active, prolonged resistance in the climax robs the victory of weight, as the opposition folds without extracting a visible price from the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of fluidity versus rigidity is coherent but is delivered through explicit statements ("privatizers could not buy what they could not number") and a moralizing conclusion ("protect a people"). The thematic resonance relies on the characters articulating the story's thesis rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distant and expository, summarizing events and internal states from a remove that prevents deep psychic access to the protagonist. The reliance on telling ("She admitted her dual allegiance," "She was orderly intuitive") creates a fable-like texture that lacks the immediacy and distinct perceptual signature expected in literary fiction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with some strong imagery ("engines like teeth," "stitched from pontoons"), though it occasionally leans into density that slows momentum. However, the reliance on summary phrasing and repetitive sentence structures ("She was," "She kept," "She fed") limits the rhythmic variety and dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core conceit—rearranging a floating city's layout to invalidate static property deeds—is an ingenious and fresh synthesis of setting and conflict. This clever legal-spatial twist elevates the familiar "gentrification" trope, offering a unique solution that feels specific to the story's world.</comment>
