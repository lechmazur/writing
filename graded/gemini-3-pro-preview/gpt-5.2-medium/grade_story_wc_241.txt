<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict—counting versus gambling, order versus the father's chaos—is dramatized effectively through the scavenger hunt. The shift from resentment to understanding ("a lesson aimed at me") is a well-earned resonant reconfiguration. The "theoretically rebellious" trait feels slightly more told than shown, but the final choice to engage with the father creates genuine intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc follows a clear causal chain (clues leading to realization), but the timeline and spatial logic fray in the final third. Returning to the library to set up a public exhibit for students in the middle of the night/storm, before visiting the recovering father, strains credibility and pacing. The "exhibit" beat feels inserted to satisfy a setting constraint rather than arising from urgent character need.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "wet stone," "scratched vinyl," and "mica pane" create a distinct, tactile atmosphere. The subway stations and the library are vividly rendered. The logic of using a candle lantern in a public library because "power flickered" is atmospherically charming but teeters on the edge of twee.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes—understanding the father's addiction before losing him—are palpable and escalate well through the subway messages. The message "Teach them odds, then teach them cost" delivers a strong thematic deepening. The resolution is quiet but weighty, paying off the emotional cost of the journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "lucid contradictions" is woven tightly into the narrative structure and imagery. The clover symbol evolves from a smell to a childish doodle to a metaphor for grief, successfully avoiding cliché. The lesson about "stopping" lands with earned conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, suiting the "clover melancholy" tone perfectly. The narrative distance is controlled, filtering the world clearly through the daughter's analytical yet grieving perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, but word echoes mar the immersion (four uses of "mica pane," four of "clover"). The phrasing "widen perspectives responsibly" feels stiff and expository within the otherwise lyrical flow. Density is high, but the repetition suggests a need for tighter line-level editing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The conceit of reading subway seat scrawls as a scavenger hunt/legacy is fresh and specific. Combining probability theory with an emotional father-daughter reconciliation offers a distinct angle on the addiction narrative.</comment>
