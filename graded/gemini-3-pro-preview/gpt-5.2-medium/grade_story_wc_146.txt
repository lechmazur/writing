<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sava functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character, lacking internal contradiction, doubt, or distinct interiority. While appropriate for a fable, the lack of an emotional hierarchy or difficult choice limits engagement; he is a vehicle for the concept rather than a protagonist under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, but the resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the magical mechanism solves the structural and bureaucratic conflict too easily. The causality of walking fixing physical architecture is accepted as a premise, but the climax—the official simply folding his paper—lacks friction or earned cost beyond mentioned bleeding feet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atmospheric grounding is strong, effectively using the basalt archway and cobblestones to establish the story's acoustic logic. The setting actively participates in the plot as the instrument being tuned, satisfying the requirement for environment-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stakes are clearly established (abandonment of the district), but the escalation is linear and low-resistance; the town's restoration proceeds without setbacks or significant opposition. The antagonist is an abstract decree, and its defeat feels inevitable rather than hard-won through sacrifice or tactical ingenuity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme of communal resonance is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements like "balance shared between streets and hearts." The ending offers a tidy moral resolution ("ghost town revival turned into home") that lacks the ambiguity or conceptual repricing found in top-tier literary work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical fable tone that suits the material well. However, the omniscient distance precludes deep intimacy, and the perspective remains largely external, observing the ritual rather than inhabiting the struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, fitting the subject, though it occasionally drifts into strained imagery ("listened harder than anyone breathed"). There is a reliance on "writerly" descriptions that prioritize sound over precision, but the line-level momentum is generally preserved.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central conceit of tuning a town like an instrument is imaginative and offers a fresh lens on the "saving the town" trope. However, the execution follows a standard magical-realist repair arc without subverting expectations or adding a layer of harsh reality to the magic.</comment>
