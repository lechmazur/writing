<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinct, balancing "reckless" exploration with "religious skepticism" in a way that feels embodied rather than labeled. The final choice—sealing the tunnel but forcing the confrontation—is a strong, earned stance that arises from the character's internal conflict and the events of the story.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is compelling, with a strong closure that effectively reconfigures the relationship and the protagonist's burden. However, the mechanics of the hidden note—painted over yet containing a written confession—strain logical credibility (why write a confession if she "never told anyone"?) in an otherwise grounded investigation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and specific, with details like "wet iron," "throat of brick," and the "warm" beads grounding the supernatural elements. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, and the shift from the physical tunnel to the "ghost shift" is handled with excellent sensory precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from a verbal confession to a supernatural confrontation, utilizing the radio signals as an effective tension ratchet. The cost is palpable and clearly defined at closure: the protagonist assumes the "heft" of the truth, foreclosing the possibility of ignorance or easy forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "accounting" versus "haunting" provides excellent resonance, reframing a ghost story trope into a narrative about moral debt. The story explores the physical weight of truth—a central motif—without resorting to abstract moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The noir-inflected voice is consistent and distinct, effectively filtering the supernatural elements through a grounded, weary perspective ("drowsy alertness"). The integration of the radio "method" into the narration adds a unique, character-specific texture to the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic ("confession dropped... like a bolt"), maintaining strong momentum throughout. While most imagery is evocative, the description of eyelids that "click" strains the metaphor slightly, though it fits the heightened sensory state.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of noir detective tropes with industrial ghost story elements is fresh and effective. The specific mechanism of using talk-radio psychics to interpret the environment adds a unique layer of ingenuity to the investigation method.</comment>
