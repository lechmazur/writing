<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is exemplary; Nerin's professional background as a translator is not merely a label but the cognitive lens through which he processes grief and physics. This integration of skill and emotional arc creates a unique interiority where "grammatical markers" explain metaphysical events, making the final choice deep and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving from setup to a high-stakes connection and a decisive release. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shift from "trapping" the spirit to "planting" understanding recontextualizes the initial ambition with visible emotional cost (letting the sister's warmth fade).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "levitating boughs" and "magnetic currents" constrain physical action (tightening copper bands) and drive the plot. Sensory details like "tastes like cold iron and apple skin" establish a distinct atmosphere immediately.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conflict between the desire to hold on (grief/ambition) and the danger of doing so (madness) is well-staged. While the "snap" of the field aids the decision, Nerin's active choice to let the light pass and plant the seed ensures agency and clearly articulates the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme is beautifully articulated through the protagonist's specific worldview: death as "conjugation" rather than rupture. This metaphor elevates the story beyond standard grief tropes, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is perfectly controlled, filtering the fantastical elements through Nerin's grounded, scholarly perspective. The consistency of the linguistic metaphor ("sentence runs off the edge") reinforces the character's distinct perception without breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative imagery ("gravity forgot her name"). The prose rhythm mirrors the protagonist's methodical nature while maintaining propulsion during the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistic theory and spirit mechanics is a fresh, specific angle on the "scientific necromancy" subgenre. Treating a ghost's trajectory as a grammatical arc is a genuinely ingenious conceptual move.</comment>
