<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara serves primarily as a thematic vessel rather than a deeply embodied character; her motivation to understand "aliveness" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. While her internal logic is consistent, the lack of significant interpersonal friction or high-stakes trade-offs leaves her development feeling somewhat abstract. The "creeping normality" trait functions more as a label than a driver of difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative operates effectively as a fable, utilizing an Accumulative design where iterative actions build toward the storm climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—releasing the shard—which lands with clear conceptual weight. However, the reliance on summary ("Night after night") rather than immediate scene work dilutes the causal tension in the middle section.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and specific, with sensory details like the "orris root... sweet with violets" and "streetlights daydreaming" establishing a strong mood. The setting actively supports the magical realism elements, though the iterative nature of the middle section turns some environments into lists rather than inhabited spaces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are relatively low and abstract; the primary tension is atmospheric rather than urgent or interpersonal. While the storm provides a climax, Mara’s actions generally face little resistance or risk, resulting in a gentle narrative that lacks the sharp "tightening" or high cost required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of attention-as-life is coherent but delivered didactically through narration ("aliveness... was not magic but attention") and dialogue. The story relies on explaining its subtext rather than letting it emerge solely from dramatic action, reducing the potential for unguided resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, managing the fable-like tone with confidence. The transition between the iterative summary and the specific climax is handled smoothly, maintaining a consistent psychic distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("compact quiet that burned gently"), showing strong command of rhythm. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly twee personification ("tables are thinking," "streetlights daydream"), but the line-level craft is generally high-quality and propulsion is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of "home organization" with magical realism creates a fresh, engaging premise. While the "magic of attention" is a familiar trope, the specific embodiment through the orris root shard and the "hush" object offers a distinct and imaginative execution.</comment>
