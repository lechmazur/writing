<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara functions effectively as a catalyst for the town's healing but lacks personal risk or internal contradiction. She operates from a position of secure competence, resolving the boy's challenge and Sorrel's grief with ready wisdom rather than struggling through genuine doubt or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The closure is resonant, successfully reconfiguring the town's silence into invitation. However, the structure relies heavily on iterative summary ("seven days, then fourteen") to span weeks, trading the immediate pressure of a continuous scene for a fable-like montage that distances the reader from the process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "wet salt and crushed lime" and "greened by seawater" create a vivid, specific atmosphere. The setting is integrated well with the themes of corrosion and renewal, grounding the abstract concept of "absences" in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear on a communal level, but the protagonist faces minimal active opposition; obstacles (Sorrel's memory, the boy's cynicism) are overcome quickly with therapeutic insight. The escalation feels low-friction, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "navigated absences" is handled with sophistication, particularly the inversion where silence is revealed as a tool of resistance rather than just oppression. The ending synthesizes the physical object and the thematic concept beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly lyrical, though it leans toward explaining the protagonist's mental state ("Mara knew meaning assembled slowly") rather than showing it through action. The tone supports the fable-like quality well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery ("gaps that felt like reefs"). There is a tendency toward aphoristic summary ("a town without its broken pieces...") that borders on sentimentality, but the line-level craft is generally high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central concept of an archivist charting what is missing is fresh and compelling. The twist regarding the herald's silence offers a nuanced take on the trope of the silent decree.</comment>
