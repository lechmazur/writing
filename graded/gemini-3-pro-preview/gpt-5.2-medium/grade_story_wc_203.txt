<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is sharply drawn through competence and a distinct, weary voice ("responsibility without a body"). The blend of technical expertise with supernatural sensitivity creates a unique, embodied perspective. While the self-description ("I am skillfully observant") leans slightly on telling, it is immediately redeemed by the concrete action of analyzing dust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causality is tight and investigative; the dust analysis logically leads to the discovery, which unlocks the backstory and resolution. The closure (marking the wall, taking the spring) is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the tangible weight of the "small heart" in the pocket, satisfying the drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are specific and evocative ("sugared peanuts," "ink-stained cuffs," "white plaster"), doing double duty to establish atmosphere and drive the investigation. The setting is not just a backdrop but a puzzle box that constrains action (the jammed door, the ceiling void) and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conflict is atmospheric and investigative rather than high-stakes confrontation, fitting the "Situational" lens well. Pressure accumulates effectively through the quiet interaction with the dead, though the "cost" is more symbolic (the burden of the object) than visceral, keeping the tension effectively low-key but palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of mechanical and spiritual repair interweaves beautifully, grounded in the specific object of the mainspring barrel. The ending resonates without moralizing, using the "cracked facade" and the "hidden chain" to suggest a larger truth about sealing leaks between eras.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and suitably professional, bridging the gap between the mundane and the spectral. The transition from technical observation to ghostly communion is handled with confident rhythmic control ("the quiet arrives like a curtain drop").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of scaffold; lines like "the living lie with words, but dust never does" add texture without stalling momentum. The imagery is precise ("cracked into a grin of white plaster") and the sentence structures vary purposefully to control pacing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator repair procedural with a ghost story is fresh and executed with specific, non-generic details. The "horologist's mainspring" solution transforms a standard haunting trope into something mechanical and grounded.</comment>
