<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara is a vividly realized protagonist whose contradiction—grief masked by theatricality—drives the narrative. Her profession as a glassblower is not merely aesthetic but instrumental to the resolution, and her internal struggle with the "verdict" of silence is deeply embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving from a return driven by external thawing to a resolution driven by internal warmth. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the transformation of the bunker into an observatory physically manifests the psychological shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and distinct, functioning as both a physical constraint (melting ice, sighing tiles) and a metaphorical echo of the protagonist's state ("ribs around an empty heart"). The shift from cold opacity to warm transparency is masterful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal, pitting the trauma of past silence against the need for present expression. While the external pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, the emotional stakes are high and the cost—confronting the "verdict"—is palpable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transparent inquiry is beautifully integrated through the glassblowing motif. The final realization regarding the "thawing heart" is profound, though articulating the thesis so explicitly in the narration ("steady decision to let warmth circulate") borders on telling rather than resonating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, effectively layering the protagonist's "bright but edged" performative persona over her deeper melancholia. The transition between the theatrical monologue and the introspective narration is seamless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing momentum. Images like "corridor tiles sighed" and "pale lanterns" serve the drive lens well. The text avoids scaffold and maintains a strong rhythmic pulse throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic research station setting with the specific craft of glassblowing is fresh and generative. The concept of building physical "safe zones" for abstract inquiry is a unique and compelling take on the prompt's elements.</comment>
