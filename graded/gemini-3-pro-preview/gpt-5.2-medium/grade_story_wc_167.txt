<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ilya is a consistent, archetypal figure, but he lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle. He functions as a vehicle for wisdom rather than a character making difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The resolution relies on "fable logic" where a committed antagonist instantly reverses policy due to a poetic metaphor. This lacks causal credibility and elides the necessary cost for such a victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and texturally rich, with specific trade details like the glazier's satchel and lead came grounding the scene. The atmosphere of the mist and dawn is effectively rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Tension evaporates rather than escalates; the inspector offers no meaningful resistance to Ilya's lesson. The protagonist pays no price for the outcome, resulting in a low-stakes interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue, reducing subtext and resonance. The story preaches its moral—value in the mundane—rather than allowing it to emerge organically from friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, though it occasionally leans into overwrought "writerly" phrasing. The tone suits the fable-like structure but creates distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with good sensory grounding. Some abstract phrasing slows momentum, but the line-level craft is generally competent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise of a craftsman teaching a bureaucrat the meaning of life via nature is a familiar trope. While the glazier details are fresh, the narrative arc is standard and predictable.</comment>
