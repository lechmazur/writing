<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Galen is a clearly drawn, competent protagonist whose specific worldview ("potter's mind") drives his interaction with the anomaly. While his internal struggle is subordinate to the external mystery, his competence is actionable rather than proclaimed, and his interaction with Sera adds necessary human stakes to the metaphysical problem.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from diagnosis to a decisive act of "centering" that functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost: the loss of the oasis's miraculous immortality in exchange for a "mortal present," logically following the established rules of the kiln/pottery metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, successfully blending the scorched wasteland with the specific imagery of the apiary ("hives stacked like little kilns"). The environment actively constrains the characters via the fractured footprints and splitting shadows, making the setting integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently through the visual distortion of the environment and Sera's dual state (thirsty/quenched). The resolution involves a tangible trade-off—ending the preservation to restore alignment—which gives weight to Galen's choice, avoiding a costless magic fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of "centering" is woven well into the action, but the final sentence explicitly summarizes the moral ("Galen understood that resistance can be a refuge..."), which reduces the resonance of the closing image. This explicit thematic echo in the final paragraph triggers a deduction for over-articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent fable-like quality that suits the subject matter. The shift in perspective from the physical ("dust under nails") to the metaphysical is handled smoothly without breaking the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and sensory-rich ("chimney smoke flattens," "pressed-gray lid," "honest dust"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the pacing of the discovery and the ritual, with no visible artifacts or scaffolding loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of pottery concepts ("stacking bowls," "centering clay") with the sci-fi premise of time fractures is fresh and specific. The story successfully transforms the "resistance to change" prompt into a concrete mechanical reality rather than a generic abstraction.</comment>
