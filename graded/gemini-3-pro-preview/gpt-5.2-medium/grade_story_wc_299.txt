<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's internal arc—from using facts as emotional insulation to embracing the "after-applause hush"—is compelling and well-motivated. The dual identity of roadie/appraiser creates a unique filter for processing grief, though Marla's role is primarily catalytic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causality is tight, with the livestream failure motivating the quarry job and the cloth discovery driving the pivot in methodology. The closure (proposing the listening station) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the brother connection is a slightly convenient validator.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and thematic; the "humming walls" and "scar of stone" reinforce the auditory focus. The specific sensory details of the burn test and the silver thread effectively ground the scene in the narrator's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internalized, pitting professional safety against emotional honesty. The escalation leads to a distinct choice—abandoning the safe "facts" for a riskier, memory-based interpretation—that feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose in the silence after applause is powerful, but the final sentence explicitly summarizes the moral ("I realized purpose was not applause..."). This overt statement flattens the resonance of the preceding image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is excellent, seamlessly blending technical jargon (tolex, circuit board) with melancholic introspection. The narrator's perceptual signature—hearing the world as a roadie—remains consistent and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "listened to arenas breathe." The writing avoids scaffold and maintains momentum, effectively using the specific vocabulary of the narrator's trade.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a disgraced appraiser and a former roadie offers a fresh perspective on the value of objects. The "echo valley" concept feels unique, though the resolution relies on a somewhat familiar personal connection trope.</comment>
