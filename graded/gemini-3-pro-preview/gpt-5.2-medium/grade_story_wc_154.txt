<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lani is a distinct professional with clear agency, and her internal "dictionary" of anxiety provides strong grounding. However, the secondary characters (Captain, Liaison) function as convenient plot devices who yield their deep-seated grievances too easily, reducing the sense of genuine interpersonal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The central mechanism (decrypting the cast) is clever and the inciting incident is strong. However, the resolution relies on a "fable logic" where a single explanation instantly dissolves deep sectarian hatred, making the closure feel unearned and frictionless despite the causal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with specific, evocative imagery ("gray coins," "safe paper") that serves the mood well. The environment of the atrium actively contrasts with the violence outside, grounding the story in a tangible atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and are high (preventing an ambush), but the pressure evaporates instantly at the climax. The antagonist forces offer no resistance to Lani's explanation, which removes the necessary cost or trade-off usually required for a resolution of this magnitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of language as a bridge is coherent throughout. However, the ending explicitly articulates the moral ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") rather than allowing the final image of the coral and cast to carry that weight implicitly, resulting in a slightly sermonizing closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and somewhat melancholic tone that suits the hospital setting. There are moments of "purple" drift ("footstep sound like a prayer"), but the control of distance and perspective remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with strong sensory density ("ink swelled where tears had touched it"). The required phrase "lotus hearted ache" disrupts the register slightly, but overall rhythm and syntax are handled with competence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core conceit—using a child's plaster cast as a covert medium for cross-conflict communication—is genuinely inventive and emotionally potent. This specific detail elevates the story above standard "translator mediates conflict" tropes.</comment>
