<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s voice is distinct, and her internal conflict between the warden’s duty ("expunge") and the storyteller’s duty ("spin stories") is well-calibrated. The motivation is clear and drives the plot. The emotional processing of betraying her father’s legacy is handled primarily through retrospective summary rather than dramatized hesitation, which keeps the emotional cost slightly distant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story relies on a summary/montage structure (Ridgeway -> Station -> Town -> Meeting) rather than a continuous scene, which distances the reader from the immediate pressure of the investigation. While the causality is sound and the closure (the town meeting/audit) is decisive, the lack of a sustained dramatic scene reduces the visceral impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the receding water and the mud literally reveal the evidence and constrain the protagonist's access. The atmosphere ("mirrored hush," "judgmental sky") charges the final image and the decision-making process, meeting the standard for excellence in this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes (truth vs. legacy) are clearly established and escalate logically through the discovery of artifacts. However, because the confrontation is with a memory/past record rather than an active present-tense antagonist, and the resolution is summarized, the narrative lacks a moment of high-pressure, uncertain struggle on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "resurfacing as audit" is exceptionally well-integrated with the plot mechanics. The recontextualization of the wind chime—from a silencer of truth to a voice of memory—provides a resonant conceptual repricing at the end without resorting to heavy-handed moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, authoritative, and suitably lyrical ("sounds like listening," "matching angles like stitching"). The tone matches the melancholic, precise nature of the protagonist’s work, maintaining control even through the time jumps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong imagery ("rooflines... rising from mud as if waking"). The line-level craft is high, though the reliance on "telling" verbs to bridge the time jumps (e.g., "I told them," "We set the recovered photographs") slightly flattens the momentum in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a levee warden as a curator/censor of a drowned town offers a fresh, specific angle on the "submerged city" trope. The synthesis of the physical drought with the metaphorical "resurfacing" of truth feels organic and earned.</comment>
