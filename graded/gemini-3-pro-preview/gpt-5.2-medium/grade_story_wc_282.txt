<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is tightly integrated with professional identity; Mina’s shift from observer to participant is earned through specific sensory interiority. The choice to abandon her mother’s gift to comfort the entity demonstrates a profound reconfiguration of her values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is flawless, moving from physical entrapment to metaphysical connection with clear causality. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the surrender of the fossil acts as a tangible cost that permanently alters her relationship to the unknown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is exceptional, filtering every description through Mina's unique "map maker" lens. The environment is not just a backdrop but an active antagonist and eventual partner that constrains choice and shapes the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical survival (tide) to existential contact; the "longing that did not feel like hers" effectively raises the emotional price. The resolution requires a meaningful trade-off—safety and heritage for connection—satisfying the requirement for visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of the "transitional object" is masterfully expanded from human psychology to inter-species geology without heavy-handed exposition. The ending recontextualizes the premise, offering a resonant answer to the story's central question of loneliness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and rigorously controlled, maintaining a "factually mystical" tone that suits the protagonist perfectly. Perceptual signature is unique and sustained, with no lapses in distance or authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrasing like "thin as paper and hard as time" creates immediate, efficient texture that serves both atmosphere and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-human hibernation, sensory cartography, and sentient geology feels startlingly fresh. The story transforms potential tropes into a specific, lived reality that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
