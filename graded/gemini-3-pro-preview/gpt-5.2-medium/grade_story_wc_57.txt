<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lio functions as a consistent archetype but lacks the internal contradiction or doubt required for depth; he succeeds without paying a personal cost or navigating a difficult choice beyond patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies on summary to bypass the climax ("demonstrated... clerk agreed") rather than dramatizing the struggle; the resolution is too convenient and unearned by the preceding action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric details are vivid and specific ("bubbles caught gold light," "salt stiff"), effectively grounding the fable-like tone in a tangible physical world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>While the stakes of erasing memory are high, the conflict resolves through a sudden, low-cost agreement; the antagonist folds instantly without applying genuine pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving memory through organic methods is coherent and resonates in the final image, though the "moral" is stated somewhat explicitly in the dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fable-like voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, creating a distinct "oceanic hush" that suits the content perfectly and controls the narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery is dense and evocative ("sentence without paper"), but the phrase "infinitely patient" repeats verbatim in a short space, creating a distracting template artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed collecting and reading memory through knots offers a fresh, poetic system that feels specific, imaginative, and functionally integrated.</comment>
