<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is deep and precise; Lira’s motivation ("crystallize a fleeting emotion") is beautifully dramatized through her specific trade. Her internal conflict regarding the "mirage of safety" adds stakes to every action, and her composure under pressure reveals a hardened, competent pro. The connection between her father's death and her current vocation is moving and earns the emotional weight of the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with pressure escalating from the drawing process to the inspector's intrusion. The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds well, leading to a resonant closure. However, the climax relies heavily on the supernatural element (the chair groaning) to resolve the antagonist's threat, which slightly displaces the protagonist's agency at the pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the "vanishing point" perspective lines mirror the thematic concept of disappearance and death. Sensory details like the "river smell," "shattered porcelain," and "cracked skylight" ground the magical elements in a gritty reality. Capped at 8.8 due to global gate rules (Q2 &lt; 9.0), but otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are high and palpable, driven by the immediate physical threat of the curfew and the deeper emotional duty to the dead. The escalation is effective, tightening the screws as the drawing completes and the inspectors arrive. The resolution earns its release, though the "somber marvel" of the antagonist feels slightly rapid given the brevity of the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving the memory of the "disappeared" through ash portraits is poignant and fully realized. The interplay between the "vanishing point" illusion and the reality of loss creates a rich subtext without needing heavy exposition. Capped at 8.8 due to global gate rules, but thematically profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical and consistent in tone, matching the melancholic magic of the premise. However, the score is capped due to line-level artifacts (tense inconsistency) penalizing Q7. While the narrative distance is generally well-controlled, the mechanical slips in tense disrupt the otherwise smooth POV immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, but significant grammatical slips mar the execution. Tense shifts occur at key moments ("she weaves truth" in a past-tense narrative; "chair finally slows... inspectors left"), breaking the timeline's logic. These artifacts are jarring in an otherwise polished piece and trigger the heavy line-level debt penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of an ash scatterer creating temporary portraits in a vanishing point gallery is highly original and imaginative. The specific magic system (the chair, the mask, the ash) feels fresh and metaphorically resonant, transforming a standard "oppressive regime" trope into something unique.</comment>
