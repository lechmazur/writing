<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara is a capable, proactive protagonist whose deafness is integrated meaningfully into her competence, allowing her to sense vibrations others miss. However, her internal landscape is relatively static; the "emotional numbness" functions more as a plot device than a source of deep psychological friction or contradictory impulse. She solves the external problem with professional skill, but the personal cost is minimal, lacking a moment of difficult choice or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, tight causal arc from diagnosis to resolution, with the "backward song" mechanic providing a satisfying logical pivot. The closure is decisive and legible, effectively reconfiguring the status quo. The inciting incident and climax are well-paced, though the solution relies on a slightly convenient magical interaction (scratching the record hurts the entity) that is accepted largely due to the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the tactile descriptions of sound ("vibrations thin under her boots," "skitter like startled mice") which ground the supernatural elements in the protagonist's POV. The cavern setting is not just a backdrop but an acoustic container that shapes the conflict. The atmosphere is cohesive, though the "turning seasons" bookends feel slightly ornamental compared to the visceral dampness of the cave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (emotional death of the town), and the pressure escalates coherently from the broken needle to the entity's reveal. However, the protagonist achieves victory primarily through competence without paying a significant on-page price; she risks little personal loss to defeat the Listener. The conflict resolves somewhat easily once the correct technical procedure is applied, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a trade-off that would heighten the emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of silence as a parasite is compelling and well-executed through the imagery of the filament. However, the ending drifts into explicit moralizing ("carrying with her a new lesson: play the song backward..."), which flattens the thematic resonance into a stated aphorism. This didactic conclusion reduces the ambiguity and lingering emotional weight expected in high-end literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Mara's sensory experience, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the material. The POV remains disciplined, avoiding head-hopping even with the Listener's arrival. The tone manages the shift from mystery to confrontation well, though at times the prose leans slightly purple ("mirrored hush," "exhaled a cold draft") in its effort to maintain atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally strong, with sentence structures that mimic the musicality of the subject matter. Imagery is distinct and avoids cliché ("drifts like gray pollen"). There is a slight overuse of the word "hush" and "numbness" within the short word count, creating minor lexical redundancy, but the line-level density is otherwise high and propels the story forward effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf protagonist, a phonograph-dwelling parasite, and the concept of "backward rhythm" creates a fresh, specific angle on the "emotional void" trope. While the "monster representing depression" is a familiar device, the mechanical specificity of the solution (scoring the record) adds ingenuity. The execution elevates a standard fable structure through unique textural details.</comment>
