<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Celeste’s internal conflict—her father’s legacy of error versus her own need for accuracy—is expertly externalized through the prop of the rosewood nib. Her decision to "intervene" rather than destroy aligns perfectly with this established motivation. The choice to forego the sensational headline for the "quiet report" is a decisive character beat that proves her growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from suspicion to mathematical proof to physical evidence (dust) and finally to a negotiated resolution. The closure (a Conceptual Repricing of the situation from "fraud" to "funding crisis") lands with the visible cost of the lost headline. The use of the logbook intervention provides a tangible, high-stakes resolution on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting is active, not just decorative; the echoes "rehearsing her doubts" and the "white sea" isolation heighten the pressure of the confrontation. Specific details like the "mug stamped with moons" and "red lamps" ground the scene sensually. The environment effectively constrains the antagonist, leaving him no exit but the truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly delineated between the "beautiful, dangerous" headline and the messy truth. The escalation is logical, moving from tremor to math to physical proof. The resolution—a bargain that sacrifices the "miracle" story to save the work—demonstrates clear agency and cost, though the antagonist's capitulation is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "orbit of regret" metaphor successfully binds the protagonist and antagonist, creating a coherent thematic frame. However, the final dialogue ("plenty of truth") explicitly articulates the story’s thesis in the closing paragraph, triggering a rubric deduction for Thematic Echo. The resonance is strong, but the overt labeling softens the subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent "observant" distance appropriate for Celeste. The metaphorical language ("headlines like a planet," "star charts like laundry") unifies the scientific and journalistic domains. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Celeste’s judgment throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong imagery ("rain tick," "writing should cut clean"). A few filter constructions ("she saw how," "she watched") slightly distance the reader in key moments. The writing is precise and rhythmically controlled, avoiding major artifacts while propelling the investigation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subversion of the "exposing the fraud" trope—choosing to manage the truth to save the institution—offers a fresh, mature angle on the genre. The synthesis of the "orbit" metaphor with the plot mechanics is ingenious. It avoids the easy binary of hero/villain for a more complex, negotiated outcome.</comment>
