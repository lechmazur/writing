<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear agency by tearing the ledger to help the bear, earning the internal shift. However, interiority relies partly on diagnostic labels ("introverted fit me better," "silence... was a wound"), which distances the reader from the embodied experience of the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's relationship to silence (from endurance to scoring measures) lands with conceptual weight. The causal chain is solid, though the bear's arrival is a convenient situational pressure that drives the realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sensory details of the "crystal whispering forecourt" and the brass dust memory are vivid and specific. The score is held back by slightly purple phrasing ("stones... swallowed the sky") and the abstract insertion of "petrichor nostalgia" which disrupts the atmospheric grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Internal pressure regarding the "abandoned dream" is strong and resolves meaningfully. The external pressure (the bear) is somewhat low-stakes as the animal is immediately docile ("glacial hush had trained it"), reducing the tension of the physical encounter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming silence into music is resonant, but the execution relies on explicit statements ("silence was not a vow, it was a wound") rather than letting the subtext of the bear's wound carry the meaning. This over-articulation flattens the epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The meditative, rhythmic voice fits the setting well. However, the use of modern concepts like "introverted" breaks the cloistered, timeless immersion, and the narrative distance wavers during the thematic explanations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("faint comma on the wet stone") is undercut by repetition of the phrase "glacial hush" (three times) and the awkward noun-phrase insertion of "petrichor nostalgia." These artifacts, along with some interpretive scaffolding, clutter the line-level execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the clock-scribe profession with the quartz-vein mechanic is fresh and evocative. While the "taming the beast" beat is a familiar trope, the specific resolution of scoring silence elevates the concept.</comment>
