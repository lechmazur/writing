<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena is a distinct, competent focalizer whose reverence for the music grounds the surrealism. While her motivation is clear and she moves the plot efficiently, she lacks significant internal conflict or a distinct flaw that complicates her choices; she functions more as a faithful disciple solving a puzzle than a character forced into a painful trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the decoding mechanic, moving cleanly from the pit to the rehearsal room with clear causal linkages (water reveals map -> map leads to location -> action yields next clue). The closure—reconfiguring the orchestra into the corridors—is a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration that logically follows the established rules of the ghost's game.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional because it acts as both atmosphere and the primary mechanic; the floodwater is literally the tool used to decode the plot's central object. This integration of environment and agency (using the destructive element to create meaning) fulfills the high-band requirement where setting constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The pressure is coherent and atmospheric, escalating through the deepening mystery of the maps and the physical navigation of the ruined space. However, the opposing force ("the fear that kept everyone away") is stated rather than deeply felt or personified, making the stakes intellectual and artistic rather than visceral or urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation and finding music in "gaps" is beautifully threaded through the mechanics of the plot (the broken bars, the water-stained maps). The ending resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal answer to the problem of ruin by transforming the performance space itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately lyrical, matching the magical realism of the premise. The POV filters the world strictly through a musician's sensibility ("nervous bow stroke," "first position," "fermata"), creating a strong perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density ("taken the river into its ribs"). While generally effective, the reliance on simile constructions ("like a nervous bow stroke," "like wrecked ships," "like the moment before") becomes slightly repetitive, creating a cadence that occasionally draws attention to the writing rather than the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core concept—using floodwater to develop ghost notes on an antique program—is a highly original synthesis of setting and plot. The execution feels fresh and specific, transforming a standard "ghost in a theater" trope into a tactile, atmospheric puzzle.</comment>
