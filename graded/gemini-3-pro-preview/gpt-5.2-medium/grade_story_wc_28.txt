<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Samir is a compelling protagonist whose physical "gentle radicalism" (the Grasp) drives the narrative. Lina serves as a strong foil, though her pivot from vengeance to cooperation relies partly on the convenient identity of the arsonist (her cousin) rather than pure persuasion, slightly softening the character conflict's edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from the solitary vision to the confrontation and finally the restorative ritual. The closure is excellent: the "Grasp" provides a Decisive Change that enacts the story's philosophy with visible, physical cost (restraint and labor) rather than abstract forgiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and thematic, particularly the "stones rinsed white" and the tessera "blue as river depth." The plaza functions as a dynamic micro-setting where the mosaic acts as both a map and a time-window, actively constraining and guiding the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high—the soul of the community and the life of the boy—and the conflict between vengeance and aberrant mercy is resolved through a unique, tangible mechanism. The resolution earns its emotional weight by acknowledging the difficulty of the choice (the "sound like winter" of the cuffs).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of aberrant mercy is integrated flawlessly into the plot's mechanics (the Grasp) and the final image. The concept of "names as scaffolds" pays off beautifully with the renaming of the plaza and the survivors, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the initial trauma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a slightly elevated, mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective stays firmly with Samir, effectively filtering the world through his mason's eye and radical philosophy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong and rhythmic but occasionally slips into abstraction or mixed metaphor (e.g., "blue fit like truth into a wound," "sound like winter"). These moments, while evocative, prioritize poetic effect over clarity, creating minor friction in an otherwise polished text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central invention of the "Grasp"—a device that enforces mercy through shared labor and sustenance—is highly original and synthesizes the prompt's elements into a fresh narrative shape. The transformation of the "weapon" trope into a tool for restorative justice is ingenious.</comment>
