<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara is a sharply drawn protagonist whose professional competence conflicts beautifully with her personal loss. Her motivation (finding her mother) justifies the escalation from passive observer to active subversive, earning the final risky choice. The interiority is specific and grounded, avoiding melodrama while conveying deep grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and compelling, moving from anomaly to investigation to discovery with clear logic. The closure is a strong Decisive Change where Mara pivots from archivist to rescuer, accepting the risk of her "lie." The transition into the "Chute" feels slightly compressed, blurring the line between physical space and digital interface, but the emotional payoff lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with evocative, sensory precision—the "hum like a choir muffled by dust" establishes the atmosphere immediately. The physical details of the server room contrast well with the digital "Chute," grounding the sci-fi elements in a tangible reality. The environment actively pressures Mara, reinforcing the theme of corporate sterility vs. human messiness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established: corporate erasure versus the truth of human survival. The conflict escalates naturally from a technical glitch to a conspiracy involving Mara's own mother. The risk to Mara is palpable in her interactions with management, though the antagonist (Legal/Lattice) remains a looming, off-screen pressure rather than a direct confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus erasure is handled with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The shift from "deleted files" to "living voices" creates a resonant reconfiguration of the story's premise at the end. The motif of the "singing" servers versus the survivors' songs ties the technological and human threads together beautifully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and melancholic, perfectly suiting a "memory keeper." The perceptual signature is strong; Mara notices "slips in metadata" like weather, which characterizes her unique worldview. The tone remains controlled even during the emotional climax, maintaining the story's "brightly attentive" quality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is exceptional—dense, rhythmic, and free of wasted motion. Images like "threads look like roads" and "dissolve into zeroes" act as micro-settings that charge the narrative. The line-level craft supports the story’s density, managing a complex backstory and plot within a compact word count without feeling rushed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a digital "Chute" as an exile for inconvenient people is a fresh take on the "ghost in the machine" trope. Combining the corporate archive setting with a survival thriller backstory creates a unique narrative space. The specific mechanism of the numbers and the patch grounds the high-concept premise effectively.</comment>
