<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Safi’s unique sensory interaction with the world ("tasting the air") creates a distinct, embodied interiority that drives the narrative. His motivation—to turn pain into craft—is clearly dramatized through the high-stakes choice to unwrap his hands, showing competence balanced with vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving swiftly from the Commander's request to the transmutation of the memories. Closure lands effectively via a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the cost of the "raw" memories is visibly paid by Safi and then distributed, altering the garrison's state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and active; the image of the "desert pretending to be a shore" justifies the logic of the sinkhole and charges the final cooking metaphor. The environment meaningfully constrains action, forcing Safi to expose his hands to the cold and resin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (mental collapse vs. survival) and escalate through Safi's physical exposure to the "contagion." The cost is palpable in the "itching" and "raw" sensation, though the resolution with the weeping soldier resolves the immediate tension somewhat rapidly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of processing collective trauma through shared consumption is handled with sophistication, avoiding simple cures in favor of "blended bitterness." The ending offers a resonant answer to the central problem without lapsing into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature, filtering abstract concepts through Safi’s gustatory lexicon (tasting air, stored remorse like spice). The tone manages to be both lyrical and grounded, matching the "sturdy yet brittle" nature of the memories.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with evocative phrasing ("worrying the desert," "remembered how to sweat") that establishes atmosphere immediately. The memory sequence uses a list structure that leans slightly toward summary, but the overall rhythm and imagery are precise and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of culinary magic, emotional contagion, and a surreal coral/desert setting feels fresh and specific. The concept of "cooking" grief avoids cliché through the gritty, physical details of the resin and the brine.</comment>
