<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is sharply defined through professional competence ("not for prayer, but for work") rather than standard emotional melodrama, which fits the ritualistic tone perfectly. Interiority is grounded in the specific "Gloom Hill" worldview, decoding the environment through a unique lens. The character feels lived-in and distinct, though the lack of a deeper personal vulnerability or sharper internal conflict prevents a push into the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a tight, cohesive Accumulative design that executes a ritual to achieve a Resonant Reconfiguration of the story's central treaty. Closure lands with precision as the "submerged concord" is successfully transferred to the soil, fulfilling the premise. The progression is flawless, though the protagonist overcomes obstacles with a level of mastery that reduces the sense of risk or "felt cost" required for the 9.0+ tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, texture-rich details ("narrow as a spine," "rattling like small bones") that enforce the "weird fiction" tone. The setting acts as an active constraint—the "bitter ground" and "poisoned" soil dictate the protagonist's tactical choices. The imagery of the blooming jetty against the empty sea charges the final beat effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stakes (peace vs. war, life vs. poison) are clear and high, but the on-page conflict is relatively low-voltage; the protagonist’s expertise solves the "pressure of memory" without a moment of genuine doubt or failure. While the "air tightens," the resolution comes smoothly through competence rather than a painful trade-off. A sharper snag or a heavier price paid for the "assent" would elevate the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming trauma through ritual and language is handled with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The shift from a "submerged concord" to a "land-garden" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The ending feels earned and expands the narrative's meaning without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and imbued with a specific melancholic authority that matches the "gloom-hill" origin. The transition between English narration and the concepts of "Eel Speech" or "naval Latin" is seamless. The narrative distance is perfectly calibrated for a story about mediation between the living and the dead.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically strong and dense with imagery ("stitching their names together," "roots threading through bullet fragments"). Information density is high, and the lines propel the ritual forward without stalling. A few phrases lean slightly toward the ornate ("horizon feels like an unrolled scroll"), but they generally serve the mythic register well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "coachman" using dead languages and bird calls to fertilize a war memorial is a highly original synthesis of fantasy and weird fiction elements. The concept of "bargaining" with the soil is fresh. The execution is safe in its quietude, but the imaginative specificities (seed pods as bones, gull calls as Latin) make it stand out.</comment>
