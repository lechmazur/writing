<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to save their home is grounded and urgent, and the relationship with Ilyas is drawn with poignant, specific detail ("patient as lichen"). The dynamic of the living learning from the dead anchors the narrative emotionally. However, the protagonist's internal struggle is relatively light; the decision to falsify the inspector's notes is made without significant hesitation or moral wrestling, slightly flattening the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drive lens (Causal) is clear, moving from the threat of demolition to a magical discovery and resolution. However, the pivotal climax—the confrontation with the inspector—is summarized ("slipped the documents... as if they were his own notes") rather than dramatized. This creates a "telling" effect at the moment of highest pressure, weakening the narrative tension just before closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with exquisite, tactile specificity that serves the story's magical realism logic. Details like the "puck of wax," the "parapet stones," and the "soot" in the cavity ground the supernatural elements in physical reality. The atmosphere of the roof at night, with meteors stitching the sky, perfectly supports the tone of repair and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (saving the building), and the pressure is coherent. Yet, the antagonist (the inspector) provides little active resistance on the page; he is easily duped in a summary paragraph, reducing the felt difficulty of the victory. The "agreed upon lies" concept introduces a fascinating constraint, but the execution of the final deception feels too convenient and low-risk to reach higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of buildings as repositories of memory and language is woven beautifully through the action and imagery. The concept of "time" as a verb and "steam" as script integrates the magical elements with the emotional core of preservation. The ending, where Ilyas becomes part of the mortar, offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "mysterious familiarity" that suits the ghost story elements perfectly. The prose rhythm mimics the patience of the tutor, and the shift from observation to action is handled smoothly. The voice confidence carries the magical elements without needing over-explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and fresh imagery ("meteors stitched white seams," "handle worn smooth by long thumbs"). There are no visible artifacts or scaffold sentences; the prose is propulsive and textured. The metaphor density is high but fits the established voice and genre without becoming purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of reading a building's history through a seal and clay to find legal loopholes is a fresh, specific take on the "saving the community center" trope. The synthesis of urban decay, linguistics, and ghost story elements feels organic. While the plot beat of tricking an inspector is standard, the method and atmospheric execution elevate it significantly.</comment>
