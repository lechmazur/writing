<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sava’s motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative from the opening ache to the final integration. While her desire for belonging is poignant, the internal friction is mild; the interaction with Oren and Ilya is cooperative rather than testing her resolve. The transition from outsider to accepted member feels earned through competence, though the emotional cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a clear inciting incident to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the arbor. The "seventh day" time jump creates a slight mosaic feel that works within the fable mode, though the discovery of the tag relies partly on luck ("flared"). Closure is strong, with the act of weaving the lattice serving as a decisive integration of the protagonist’s skills into the community.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, acting as a constraint that shapes the plot; the contrast between marsh reeds and crystal/obsidian is used effectively to drive the solution. Sensory details like the "fruit ringing softly" and "smell of rain on stone" ground the fable-like atmosphere in specific, tactile experience. The environment actively pressures the characters' choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the stakes (safety, belonging) are established, the middle section lacks acute, rising pressure; the search is a cooperative montage rather than a crucible of escalating obstacles. The resolution comes more from discovery than a hard choice forced by opposition, though the final act of dedication provides necessary agency. The threat of winter and the memory of the fallen child add background tension but do not sharply squeeze the scene beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "crafted belonging" is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question. The shift from seeking a tag to building a lattice of kinship is a satisfying conceptual repricing. The ending image of the loop-and-thorn on the woven reeds elegantly synthesizes the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The POV remains firmly with Sava, filtering the world through her artist’s eye ("scanning every facet," "reed knife"). Occasional phrasing leans towards the flowery ("luminescent ache"), but control is generally maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and no significant technical errors. There is a tendency toward adjectival density ("crystalline orchard," "shimmering crater," "glimmering obsidian") that occasionally slows momentum. However, the imagery is precise, and the line-level craft supports the story’s atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a marsh sculptor in a crystalline world offers a fresh aesthetic and a unique solution to the plot problem. The concept of a kinship map etched in glass is inventive. While the structure follows a traditional quest/discovery pattern, the specific execution and the nature of the "treasure" (a place of connection rather than gold) feel original.</comment>
