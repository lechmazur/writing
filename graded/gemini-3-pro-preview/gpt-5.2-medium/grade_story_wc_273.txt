<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Keir is a competent protagonist with distinct interiority, particularly in his management of panic ("world thickened"). However, the defining traits "consciously wild" and "serene anger" function more as static labels or mantras than fully dramatized emotional ranges until the final beat, slightly limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear, leading from investigation to discovery and resolution. However, the mechanism of entering a memory via spilled ink feels like a convenient, unestablished magic system that lowers the difficulty of the investigation. The closure is legible, but the "note" writing is a weak bridge to the final resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific ("rocks sculpted into ribs," "syrup" sky), effectively grounding the surreal elements. The contrast between the static, wind-carved camp and the slowed time of the canyon creates a strong, palpable atmosphere that supports the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes are conceptually high (systemic exploitation), but the immediate physical pressure is low because the opposition is slowed/frozen, allowing the protagonist to act with relative impunity. The victory feels somewhat inexpensive as there is no significant on-page cost or sacrifice beyond using up a supply of ink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of profiting from crisis is compelling, but the protagonist explicitly writing the moral ("Time slows because someone profits from terror...") flattens the subtext into a didactic statement. This explicit thematic echo reduces the narrative resonance significantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and confident, filtering the world through Keir's specific expertise (tracking, silence). The voice effectively blends the technological (drone) with the mystical (ink) elements without jarring shifts in register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("bright thought that refused to land"). While generally effective, some sentences become slightly breathless or over-extended with "as if" constructions, though the momentum remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of disappearing ink as a time-travel medium and the political economy of time dilation is a fresh, inventive concept. The story avoids standard tropes, offering a unique take on "time magic" that feels original and specific.</comment>
