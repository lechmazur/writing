<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s transition from detachment to intimacy is earned through the tactile inspection of Orin’s trauma. The internal conflict is resolved by a high-stakes micro-choice—sacrificing her own privacy ("my own shame")—which carries visible cost. The emotional logic holds up under the lens of professional survival turning into genuine connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scene possesses a tight causal chain where the static diagnosis leads directly to the decision to use real shame. Closure is excellent; Orin’s transformation is completed physically while his humanity is restored, and Mira’s act of writing the name serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her professional boundary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is not just backdrop but the engine of the plot; the amber fumes and the grotto’s dusk create the physical constraints for the transformation. Specific details like "bottled honey" and the "chemist’s blotter petal" ground the fantasy in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pressure is coherent and high, driven by the "live clock" of the amber transformation. The escalation from Orin's numbness to the revelation of his guilt is handled efficiently, with the stakes rising from physical survival to moral redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of authentic pain versus manufactured comfort is strong and organic to the premise. However, the final clause ("training wheels for the day I could offer something real") is an explicit Thematic Echo that summarizes the lesson rather than trusting the resonant imagery of the resin-slick coins to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinct "affectionate detachment" that feels professional yet poetic. The modulation from the clinical "distilled smiles" to the visceral "scorched orange peel" mirrors the protagonist's shift in stance perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density ("checking a cracked compass"). A slight repetition of the phrase "half truth" (three times in a short space) creates a minor loop, but the imagery is otherwise fresh and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of an emotion dealer with the specific "amber miner" mythology is fresh and non-obvious. The use of static electricity as a diagnostic tool adds a unique, grounded layer to the magic system.</comment>
