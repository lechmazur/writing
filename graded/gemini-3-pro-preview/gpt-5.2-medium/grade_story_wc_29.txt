<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara is a highly competent, agentic protagonist whose internal state (“grin she did not quite trust”) effectively mirrors the external tension. However, the antagonists (the button-wearing manager and the funding-threatening chair) read as stock obstacles rather than fully realized characters. Additionally, the pivotal realization about the “cosmic tricksters” relies on summarized backstory (reading old logs) rather than an on-page discovery, which slightly distances the reader from the moment of insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight Causal arc, moving cleanly from pressure to realization to technical intervention. The climax is active and well-paced, creating a legitimate sense of urgency. The resolution lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "trickster" explanation feels slightly convenient—a rapid backstory patch to solve the central mystery—preventing the closure from reaching the highest tier of inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is rendered with excellent, tactile specificity; details like the “bunker of glass and rust” and the “pencil worn to a splinter” ground the celestial stakes in gritty reality. The environment actively constraints the protagonist, trapping her between the equipment and the door. Because the Plot score (Q2) is below 9.0, this category is capped at 8.8 despite its vivid execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly braided, linking the personal (job security), the social (town riots), and the cosmic (invasion). The physical escalation—the manager pounding on the door—adds effective immediate pressure to the intellectual task. The resolution works, though the antagonistic pressure feels somewhat standard for the genre.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of an alien intelligence feeding on discord is a compelling thematic angle. However, the story articulates its thesis explicitly in the final paragraph (“explaining that the real contest was... who got to weaponize wonder”). This Thematic Echo flattens the subtext into a stated moral, triggering a deduction for resolving the theme through dialogue rather than implicit resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical jargon with lyrical observation (“braided sound to starlight”) to create a consistent texture. The tone matches the protagonist’s weary but determined competence. Capped at 8.8 due to the Global 9+ Gate (Q2 &lt; 9.0).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense, propulsive, and free of scaffolding or loop artifacts. Images like “prayer spoken through concrete” serve both atmosphere and character economy. This category hits the score ceiling imposed by the Q2 cap; otherwise, the line-level craft would rate higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reimagining a First Contact scenario as an information war against "cosmic tricksters" is a fresh and ingenious twist on the genre. The solution—fighting back with a subsonic lie—is technically clever and thematically satisfying. Capped at 8.8 due to the Global 9+ Gate.</comment>
