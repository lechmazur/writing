<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates strong agency and distinct interiority, with fear ("hands shook") balancing against a sense of duty. The choice to break the ancestral vow is a decisive, character-defining moment that is well-earned by the setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is tight and unbroken; the physical action of unraveling the net directly drives the escalation of sound and the climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "hush" is permanently transformed into song, satisfying the causal drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but an active constraint; the "interlaced hush" and "prism sanctuary" dictate the physics of the scene. Sensory details are specific and evocative ("bell heard underwater," "salt mirrors").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates effectively with each knot unraveled, raising the stakes as the environment reacts. The resolution with the ancestor is thematically poignant, though the immediate forgiveness slightly softens the felt cost of breaking the vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of silencing grief versus giving it voice is beautifully integrated into the magic system. The final image of the world being "exhumed from inside its own throat" offers a profound conceptual repricing of the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and authoritative, suiting the fable-like quality of the tale. The perspective remains tightly controlled, managing exposition without disrupting the immediate tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and polished, free of artifacts or scaffold. Imagery is fresh and functional ("glittered like a cut gem sunk into the dunes," "dissolved into soil like forgiven rope").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration, sonic magic, and storm spirits creates a highly original and specific mythology. The concept feels fresh and is executed with distinct vision.</comment>
