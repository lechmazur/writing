<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle is brilliantly anchored by the "counting heartbeats" trait, which serves as both a measure of fear and a mechanism for closure. Her motivation is visceral—a fight for existence against a bureaucratic erasure—and the shift from counting to stopping feels earned and emotionally resonant. The interaction with Lyle highlights her vulnerability without reducing her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, moving from the inciting status of "dead" to a "correctly recorded" resolution through a clearly established, albeit speculative, ritual. The closure lands with a precise Resonant Reconfiguration—a change in status and an internal release of fear—that feels inevitable under the story's hybrid causal-thematic lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting of the opal observatory is tactile and active, constraining the characters' interaction through the mechanics of the sensors and the cold isolation of the dome. Imagery like the "sleeping spear" telescope and the "dark lake" of ink creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that charges the ritual with weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high (existential and legal), and the tension escalates effectively through the sensory ritual of the ink and the climbing heartbeat count. While the resolution relies on the ghost's ability to rewrite the database, Mara's active participation in the "ink alphabet" and her emotional surrender provide the necessary cost to earn the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The exploration of failure, fragmentation, and the distinction between being "resurrected" and "correctly recorded" is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead offering a complex synthesis where the digital ghost's "broken" nature becomes the tool for Mara's healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, managing the speculative elements with a grounded, melancholic authority. The narrative distance is perfectly calibrated to Mara's sense of dissociation, bridging the gap between the mechanical exterior and her fearful interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, balancing strong verbs ("ribs still lift," "hard drives tick") with purposeful imagery without slipping into purple overwriting. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the pacing of the ritual, accelerating during the ink-spilling and slowing into the calm of the resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic horror, digital memory, and astronomical imagery creates a fresh and compelling premise. The specific mechanism of communication—spilled ink read as code by star sensors—is a unique and ingenious invention that elevates the standard "ghost in the machine" trope.</comment>
