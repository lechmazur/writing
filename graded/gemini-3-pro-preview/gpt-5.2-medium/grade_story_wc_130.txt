<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Characterization is distinct and consistent; Lysa's specific worldview ("mathematics of emotion") effectively drives her methodology and choices. The tension between her urge to run to her brother and her "conjurer" need for proof creates a strong, character-specific internal conflict that pays off in the bridge-building resolution. The emotional logic, while intellectualized, fits the established voice perfectly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with clear orientation and a logical progression of the magic system leading to a decisive closure. The ending successfully reconfigures the relationship (reachable but not retrievable) with visible cost. The only slight drag is the reliance on explicit summary of the realization ("took that as the theorem") rather than letting the bridge image carry the full weight of the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just atmospheric but functional; the dripping stalactites actively dictate the timing of the spell (the count of thirteen), integrating environment into plot mechanics. The cavern orchard is vivid and specific ("pear of quartz," "trees of calcite"), anchoring the magical elements in concrete physical details that constrain the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and personal, centered on the resolution of ambiguous loss. The escalation works well, moving from the ritual setup to the high-pressure moment of the opening seam. The cost—accepting connection without retrieval—is felt and coherent, resolving the central tension without a false "happy ending."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "unfinished stories" and measuring emotion is well-integrated into the plot mechanics. However, the score is capped by the explicit articulation of the moral in the final paragraph ("took that as the theorem... that love can continue without resolution"). This overt thematic summary reduces the resonant power of the ending by telling the reader exactly how to interpret the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly fable-like distance that suits the "conjurer" persona. Perception is filtered distinctly through Lysa's analytical lens. A slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("she understood," "she believed") creates occasional distance during emotional beats, but the overall control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong imagery ("laugh, close enough to bruise"). The rhythm supports the magical atmosphere. There are no significant artifacts or loops, though the explicit labeling of emotions ("tenderly furious") leans slightly on telling over showing in isolated instances.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical precision with magical ritual offers a fresh take on the "search for a lost relative" trope. The specific use of the glass eyes as alignment tools rather than for vision is an original, inventive detail that elevates the concept.</comment>
