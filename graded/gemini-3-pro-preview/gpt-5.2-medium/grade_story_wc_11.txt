<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>J-17 is a masterclass in specific non-human interiority; details like aligning "broom bristles by touch" and the "salt cart" grounding create a distinct consciousness that avoids cliché. The "longing" is dramatized through tactile interaction with the ice violin, making the emotional arc feel physically earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure functions as a decisive Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist’s programming, earned by the visible cost of the cracked bridge. The loop mechanism is taught efficiently, and the exit is driven by a clear, character-specific decision to preserve the "truer present" over infinite knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sensory detail is exquisite and strictly filtered through the robotic POV (clicks of crystals, maintenance logs), turning the setting into an extension of character. The ice violin serves as a perfect micro-setting that constrains the central choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly with the appearance of the "hairline crack," converting a philosophical quest into a tangible resource crisis with visible cost. The resolution is a distinct "Earned Stasis" where the protagonist accepts limitation to gain meaning, perfectly sized for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the janitorial and the metaphysical is profound, though the final log message borders on an explicit thematic echo (-0.3 adjustment). However, the conceptual repricing of "cleaning" as "keeping" provides a brilliant, resonant landing that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is flawless, merging technical lexicon ("processors," "safety codes") with lyrical insight ("questions rose like dust motes") without a single slip in register. The POV distance is perfectly calibrated, maintaining the "remarkably composed" trait even during the epiphany.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and image-rich ("thin line of light," "trapped air bubbles like paused breath") with zero scaffolding or synonym churn. The text achieves high information density while maintaining a smooth, propulsive cadence that matches the protagonist's meticulous nature.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise transforms standard tropes (time loops, robot humanity) into a fresh, specific meditation on memory and purpose via the "salt cart" grounding. The execution feels inevitable yet surprising, avoiding sentimental clichés for a quiet, intellectual dignity.</comment>
