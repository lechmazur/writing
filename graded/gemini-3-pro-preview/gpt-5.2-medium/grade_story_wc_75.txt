<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maris is a distinct, evocative protagonist whose role as a curator/baker drives the narrative logic. However, she lacks internal contradiction or grit; her choices are uniformly noble, and she faces no significant internal opposition or difficult trade-off, resulting in a slightly idealized "helper" archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc, but the climax relies on fable logic (bread heat thawing a frozen door) that strains credibility in a physical eviction scenario. The resolution with the Captain—who is swayed by a symbolic gesture—is a "soft reset" that resolves the threat without a commensurate paid cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, with the "curtain of water" and "door of ice" actively constraining the characters and forcing the specific solution (heat). Sensory details like "wet stone" and "rosewater" effectively ground the surreal elements in a tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (eviction, cultural erasure), and the pressure rises with the arrival of the guards. However, the external conflict dissolves too easily when the Captain accepts the bread; the lack of a hard tactical choice or sacrifice lowers the earned tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bread-as-registry metaphor is poignant and thematically integrated. However, the ending explicitly sermonizes ("explaining that a city without memory..."), transforming subtext into a lecture and triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing in the final beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Maris's curatorial perspective. The tone is maintained well across the transition from despair to resistance, with no jarring shifts in register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic ("chronology could keep the ceilings from cracking"). A few stock phrases ("insects in amber," "stomach twist") and filter verbs ("she saw," "she watched") dull the immediacy of the observation in key moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept of baking initials as a "quiet registry" is inventive and deeply humane, offering a fresh take on the refugee narrative. The synthesis of museum curation and baking creates a unique, memorable specific aesthetic.</comment>
