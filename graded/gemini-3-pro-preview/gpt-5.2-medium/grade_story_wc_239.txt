<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's role as a witness is clear, and the internal struggle against "drowning in myself" provides a functional anchor. However, the characterization remains largely archetypal; emotions are often summarized ("feared," "hoped") rather than dramatized through specific, embodied reactions to the illusions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The structure is solid, moving from the inciting "hiccup" to the climactic ritual and a clear resolution. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—shifting from escape to duty—though the middle section relies on summarized "admissions" of cost rather than fully dramatized trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "stone doors," "central well," and "mirrors" actively constrain movement and shape the climax. The contrast between the ancient temple and the "softcover dictionary" adds a productive texture to the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high (reality vs. illusion), and the pressure escalates coherently as the protagonist descends. However, the conflict remains abstract; the "narrowing" of arguments is described conceptually, softening the visceral impact of the arbitration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of unifying contradictions is effectively woven into the narrative mechanics of "spiral arbitration." The ending resonates well, reframing the restoration of reality not as a triumph, but as a heavy, necessary duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, reflective tone appropriate for an "end of history" witness. The narrative distance is controlled, and the integration of the required phrase "wanderingly exact" into the voice is handled with specific intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("reknit itself into a corridor"). There is a slight over-reliance on abstract metaphors ("ruins of certainty," "fog") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept of "spiral arbitration" using a dictionary to reconcile mirrored illusions is a fresh, imaginative synthesis. It elevates the standard "reality repair" trope into something distinct and ritually specific.</comment>
