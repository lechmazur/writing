<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s internal trajectory from ambitious savior to resolute tender of small repairs is executed with precision. The central choice—trading her cherished "developed images" (ambition/hope) for a single functional bolt—demonstrates a profound, character-specific cost. The ghost serves effectively as an externalized crucible for this internal conflict, forcing a renunciation that feels earned rather than stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a hybrid Causal/Situational lens where the ritualistic negotiation drives the plot. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the park is not "saved" in the traditional sense, but functional purpose is restored at the cost of the protagonist's dreams. The logic of the magic system (stories for ghost, memories for bolt) holds up under scrutiny.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is not merely a backdrop but the interface for the story's central transaction; its mechanics (rearranging words, holding the ghost) constrain the protagonist's actions. The sensory details ("clouds rub their bellies," "click like gears") are vivid and establish a distinct, surreal physics that grounds the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: Mara’s peace of mind versus her guilt. The escalation during the negotiation—where the ghost tests Mara’s resolve and demands a painful payment—creates genuine pressure. The "flinch" beat adds necessary vulnerability, preventing the protagonist from feeling too competent, though the ghost's resistance could have been slightly more prolonged to maximize tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of maintenance versus salvation is sophisticated and lands with emotional weight. The story avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a "dry taste" of acceptance that feels mature and resonant. The final image of the park rotating "not to entertain... but to keep the park aloft" beautifully synthesizes the narrative's stance on duty and regret.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and totally consistent with the surreal setting. The control of psychic distance is masterful, moving from the atmospheric wide shot of the lagoon to the intimate, claustrophobic exchange with the ghost. The prose manages the "chronologically confused" aspect without confusing the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The writing is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold artifacts. Phrasing is original ("tomorrow as a bruise"). A slight reliance on adjective-noun pairings in the opening ("resolute scavenger," "kinetic lagoon," "deliberate spirals") creates a heavy texture, but the rhythm smooths out significantly once the action begins.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of mechanical fantasy and psychological study. The specific mechanism of the camera wheel and the lagoon's response to spoken stories feels fresh and avoids standard fantasy tropes. The ending subverts the "fix-it" trope by prioritizing functional continuity over restoration of glory.</comment>
