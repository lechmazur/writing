<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Iris’s sensory translation of the world is compelling, grounding her motivation in specific, embodied experience rather than abstract longing. The moment she touches the stone and feels "panic" effectively dramatizes her internal conflict, though the emotional transition from that panic to the lullaby feels slightly expedited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure—redefining the map from borders to currents—lands with genuine conceptual weight. While the flashback to the astronomer is efficient, the resolution of the stone's obstacle relies on a somewhat frictionless "dowsing again" rather than a costly tactical change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "ultrasonic forest" is realized with exceptional sensory distinctness, prioritizing tactile and auditory details that rigorously align with the blind POV. The environment isn't just backdrop; the vibrating leaves and air currents actively constrain her movement and dictate her path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes of navigating grief are pressurized by the physical pain of the ring biting her skin, creating a felt cost. However, the antagonistic force (the panic in the stone) is resolved relatively quickly by "listening through her bones," which reads as a soft de-escalation of the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central metaphor of mapping grief is poignant, but the ending explicitly articulates the moral ("true navigation begins inside"), converting subtext into text. This explicit summary in the final clause, along with the literal translation of the pool's message, flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is tightly controlled, filtering every description through Iris's synesthetic perception ("leaves vibrating... like glass"). The consistent lyrical tone supports the magic realism mode without breaking immersion or slipping into generic observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, achieving high information density with images like "grammar of heartbeats." The rhythm is strong, though the density of adjectival metaphors occasionally slows propulsion in the middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, blindness, and ultrasonic magic offers a fresh, specific lens on the familiar trope of navigating grief. The concept of "burning" maps into vellum and reading skin-languages feels genuinely inventive and specific to this character.</comment>
