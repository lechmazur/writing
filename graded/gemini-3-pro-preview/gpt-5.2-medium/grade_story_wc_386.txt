<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation is explicitly stated ("salvage something pure") but lacks dramatization through difficult choices in a live scene. The reliance on summary denies the protagonist the chance to demonstrate interior depth or struggle during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece reads as a synopsis of a longer narrative rather than a short story, violating the single-scene scope default. The climax is narrated in one sentence ("told the crowd") rather than dramatized, robbing the ending of causal weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and the forensic detail of the melted glass are vivid, specific, and atmospheric. The setting effectively anchors the magical elements, even if the timeline jumps disrupt immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Conflict is summarized rather than felt; the antagonist is exposed and arrested without offering any on-page resistance. The lack of active pushback makes the resolution feel convenient and low-stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The melted snow globe serves as a potent, evolving symbol—from evidence of cruelty to a vessel of memory. The thematic conclusion regarding purity being "rescued" rather than untouched resonates strongly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and possesses a suitable mythic quality, but the extreme distance reduces emotional impact. The reliance on "telling" creates a barrier between the reader and the pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and information-dense, with strong imagery ("slump into itself," "rise like breath"). Occasional phrasing ambiguity ("sank her diving suit") momentarily disorients, but the style is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a melted snow globe as forensic evidence of underwater fire is ingenious and fresh. The blend of ghost-whispering with a procedural investigation offers a unique angle.</comment>
