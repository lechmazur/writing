<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and the voice is consistent, but the narrative relies heavily on summary during the climax. This prevents the dramatization of contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure, leaving the character feeling more like a procedural function than a conflicted individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story violates the scope default by compressing a multi-leg journey (City to Orchard to City) into a synopsis-like structure. The climax ("Back in the city, I staged my findings") is summarized rather than dramatized, which distances the reader from the causal turns and reduces the impact of the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and specific ("sky tasted like pennies," "sentences reappeared like bones," "violet sheen"). The contrast between the dust-choked city and the glossy orchard is established effectively through these details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The external stakes are well-defined, but the summary-heavy delivery of the resolution dampens the tension. The cost of the protagonist's actions (imminent arrest) is stated rather than felt in a high-pressure scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inversion of the "cursed diamond" into a "flawed detector" is a strong thematic integration that serves the "truth vs. comfortable lies" premise well. The ending resonates with the title/concept effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice maintains a consistent, noir-tinged cynicism appropriate for a debunker. The narrative distance is controlled, though the rapid pacing in the second half strains the immersion slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong imagery ("bones under sand"). The sentences have good rhythm and propel the story forward without unnecessary scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "cursed object as scientific tool" twist is a fresh take on a common trope. The setting and plot beats are otherwise standard for the genre, but the specific synthesis feels cohesive.</comment>
