<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") is poetic but drives concrete, specialized choices like the hyperbolic design, elevating the character beyond a mere functionary. The internal pivot from seeking to capture time to letting it "rust into light" constitutes a strong, earned arc grounded in the story's unique metaphysics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality is impeccable within the story's dream logic; the "halo fragment" is established early as a key that unlocks the "paper" reality, and the climax logically follows the rules of that magic. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration—lands with the tangible cost of the destroyed history and the woman's disintegration, resolving the bridge's instability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant that constrains the plot; the bridge's "dreaming in loops" necessitates the specific hyperbolic geometry of the maze. The contrast between the organic "tremor of green" and the archival "syrupy air" of the paper maze creates a distinct, pressure-filled atmosphere that shapes every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from the bridge's initial malfunction to the vertigo-inducing anomaly of the grown maze. The stakes shift smoothly from a professional task to a metaphysical rescue, with the protagonist accepting the physical danger of the "paper" reality to force a resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of time as "bark" rather than a line is woven beautifully through the imagery of growth rings and fading photos. The ending resists a simple moral, instead offering a resonant image of memory rejoining the living world, perfectly synthesizing the conflicting desires for preservation and growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, effectively bridging the gap between the technical ("hyperbolic geometry") and the organic. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through the eyes of a designer who sees structure in nature and time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("ribs," "tremor of green") with strong rhythmic control. While the required phrase "retrocognitively trapped" is slightly jarring against the organic lexicon, its repetition effectively links the caretaker's symptom to the root cause, serving the narrative pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a living bridge, hyperbolic mathematics, and a "paper maze" reality is highly original and specifically realized. The concept of a retrocognitive trap within a photograph, solved by allowing the medium to degrade, offers a fresh take on the "ghost in the machine" trope.</comment>
