<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal motivation ("geography of healing") is perfectly dramatized through the shared vulnerability of the projection ritual ("permitted only because we both needed it"). The Queen's transition from resisting rumor to accepting the "map" is earned through specific, embodied interaction rather than summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is exemplary; the "explained absence" acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration that explicitly re-prices the grief from a wound to a map with conceptual and emotional cost. The causality is tight, using the established "projecting presence" mechanic to bridge the gap between the Queen's need and the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, with details like "red as a cut lip" and "loom remembering the tension" anchoring the abstract grief in physical reality. The setting of the shadowed garden is not merely atmospheric but constrains the intimacy of the ritual, shaping the scene's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high and precise—the paradoxical demand to "write him dead without killing him" creates immediate pressure. While the external opposition is minimal, the internal and procedural tension of the ritual ("breath stutter") provides sufficient escalation and cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into geography is handled with sophisticated nuance, avoiding platitudes. The final image of the thread as a compass offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how to survive departure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like authority ("rumor does not hold a pen") that perfectly suits the "lonesome splendor" tone. The modulation of psychic distance during the projection scene—merging the observer and the observed—is masterful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no visible scaffolding artifacts. Figurative language ("hedges swallowing their own shadows," "wet with leaf decay") is functional and consistent, effectively charging the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of obituary writing, map-making, and the "projecting presence" magic system creates a highly original framework for exploring grief. The concept of the "explained absence" feels like a fresh, durable insight rather than a prompt response.</comment>
