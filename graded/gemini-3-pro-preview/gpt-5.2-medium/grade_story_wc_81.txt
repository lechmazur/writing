<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is a distinct, competent protagonist whose professional skills act as the primary lens for the narrative. Her internal motivation ("reclaimed stillness") aligns well with the external crisis, though the emotional landscape is somewhat cool and functional. The moment of "dappled resolve" feels slightly labeled rather than embodied, but her agency in the investigation is clear and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative moves with clear causal momentum from the inciting entry to the discovery of evidence. However, the pivotal deduction—realizing the disordered catalog is a code pointing specifically to a locked cabinet—relies on a significant intuitive leap that happens off-page or through compression ("Following the code"). The closure is clean and decisive, effectively securing the proof and resolving the immediate scene goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater setting is vividly rendered, acting as both a physical constraint and an atmospheric amplifier. Details like the "pale tunnel through silted water" and "velvet rot" ground the speculative elements in tactile reality. The environment actively pressures the protagonist’s movements, enhancing the sense of isolation and focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established (historical truth vs. corrupt authority) and escalate appropriately as evidence is uncovered. The pressure remains largely situational and intellectual; while the threat of the council is cited, the on-page cost is primarily the "quiet weight" of knowledge rather than an immediate visceral trade-off or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of recovering "honest origins" amidst a "stolen silence" resonates strongly through the imagery of the blackout and the sunken library. The final image of the internal lantern effectively reconfigures the external darkness into a source of personal clarity, satisfying the thematic arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, blending technical observation with lyrical reflection suited to the "literary" tone. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the world through the protagonist’s headlamp and professional bias, though occasional phrases drift into slightly overwrought abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong sensory verbs and efficient pacing. "Velvet rot" and "page exhaled" are evocative, though "dappled resolve" reads as a slightly forced modifier that creates a minor semantic stumble in an otherwise concrete sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic sunken city with a distinct archival mystery is engaging and atmospheric. While the specific puzzle mechanics (invisible impressions revealed by angled light, a hidden code in a catalog) lean on familiar genre tropes, the setting and specific voice elevate the execution.</comment>
