<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara is an expertly drawn protagonist whose "ledger" worldview creates a unique internal logic that drives the narrative. Her decision to defy Ivo is deeply rooted in her characterization as the "honest child" seeking mathematical fairness, making the climax feel inevitable yet earned. The relationship dynamic serves as a perfect crucible, forcing a shift in power that is legible and impactful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The plot moves with strong causal linkage, escalating clearly from the prep room setup to the confrontation with the agents. Closure is decisive; Mara's intervention reconfigures the outcome and permanently alters her standing with Ivo. The agent's rapid softening relies slightly on the fable-like quality of the ink, but the physical use of the "toe tag" grounds the turn in psychological reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and functional, using details like the "gurgling drain" and "roses that refused to die" to establish the requested "deathly vitality." Crucially, environmental elements like the "stainless table" and the "toe tag" are not just atmosphere but active tools that constrain action and drive the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and high, balancing Sami’s physical safety against Mara’s relational rupture with her father. The escalation is handled efficiently within the single scene, culminating in a choice that forecloses the path of complicity with visible emotional cost. The conflict is resolved through active agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "unclaimed" identities connects the corpse and the asylum seeker with profound resonance. The "ledger" motif expands beyond a quirk into a governing philosophy that reweights the ending, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of safety versus truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, filtering the scene consistently through Mara’s calculating, mathematical perspective. The metaphor of the "ledger" is sustained without becoming repetitive, and the shift in tone from the cold prep room to the heated confrontation is managed smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and polished, with standout lines like "sell a stranger his own shadow" and "margins were for people." There is zero scaffold or synonym churn; every sentence advances character or action. The imagery is precise, reinforcing the themes of death and calculation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a funeral home setting with a political asylum narrative offers a fresh, high-stakes premise. The interpretation of the prompt elements—particularly the ink pot and the "honest child"—feels organic to this specific world rather than inserted by checklist.</comment>
