<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lina is a competent, active protagonist whose "functional creativity" drives the plot, satisfying the agency requirement. However, her internal landscape is mostly metaphorical; she lacks deep contradictory impulses or genuine emotional risk, making the "stoicism" feel like a label rather than a lived trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clear, linear process of discovery and repair, but the transition to finding the architect's office is convenient and unearned by the immediate action. The closure is a "fix-it" success without a distinct, felt cost on the page; the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, functioning as a machine that the protagonist must decode and operate, not just a backdrop. Specific details like the "smell of sugar and grease" and the mechanical logic of the cistern ground the sci-fi elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The conflict is relatively low-stakes; the supervisor's radio instructions provide token opposition that Lina ignores without consequence or hesitation. The physical challenges (cold, ladders) are present but are overcome with a "calm" competence that dampens tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but culminates in an explicit thesis statement ("hope is conserved when it is redirected") that flattens the subtext into a moral lesson. This didactic ending violates the "show, don't tell" preference for thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent "engineering" filter, using metaphors of load paths and flow rates effectively. The voice is distinct and observant, though occasionally it leans into slightly purple abstractions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong images like the "blank oceans" on the tile map. The writing is dense and propulsive, though the final sentence drifts into aphorism rather than narrative closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "archeo-engineer" resurrecting a dormant facility is a familiar trope, as is the discovery of the creator's diary/notes. The integration of the carnival refuse adds a nice texture, but the core narrative beat is standard genre fare.</comment>
