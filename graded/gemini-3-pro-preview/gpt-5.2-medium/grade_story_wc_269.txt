<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is distinct, grounding her transition from witness to protector in a specific history of loss. The internal conflict is vivid, though the shift from passive observer to active conspirator relies on a summarized middle phase rather than a fully dramatized turning point beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain, and the closure—adopting the rhythm to hide the path—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with ethical cost. The middle section relies on summarized iteration ("Every month she took the page out") which slightly softens the immediate pressure, but the structural integrity is excellent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, with the tides and reef mechanics acting as hard constraints on the character's movement. Sensory details like the "slap of water" and "pale bones slowly freckling" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that directly serves the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate effectively from curiosity to a moral choice about preservation versus transparency. The climax is quieter—a handover of information rather than a high-friction confrontation—but the internal cost of the final decision to "hide the schedule" is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of restraint and the "kind of lie" required for healing is nuanced and woven deeply into the plot mechanics. The final image of "drifting moored" perfectly captures the thematic tension between movement and protective stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, professional yet melancholic, fitting the isolation of the station. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the world effectively through Mara's specific professional bias and personal history.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity ("drifting in its leash like a patient animal"). Sentence rhythm varies effectively to control pacing, and there are no visible loop artifacts or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate recovery with deliberate censorship of maps is a fresh, sophisticated take on post-apocalyptic tropes. The use of analog rhythm codes within a high-tech monitoring context adds a distinct, memorable flavor to the resolution.</comment>
