<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyra's arc from protective guardian to accepting her own obsolescence is distinct and well-handled. Her internal conflict is the story's engine, though Kael serves more as a functional catalyst than a fully fleshed counter-weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, following a clear Causal/Hybrid lens where the cave's pressure forces a realization. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and earned, though the pivot relies heavily on a vision granted at the last second.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the mechanics of the crystal cave (chimes, refraction, shadows) are not just scenery but the tools of the climax. The sensory specificity regarding the "discordant note" and "overlapping shadows" is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (the Heartstone and the world's magic) is clear, and the cost (Lyra's gift) is paid on the page. However, the external conflict is low-heat since Kael is benevolent, shifting all pressure to the internal struggle, which resolves somewhat quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of stewardship versus hoarding, and the grace of accepting obsolescence, lands with genuine resonance. The final image of the magic dispersing into the world effectively answers the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffers from excessive psychic distance. The narrative relies heavily on filter verbs ("Lyra felt," "She saw," "She had felt"), which creates a pane of glass between the reader and the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While the anaphora in the climax ("She saw... And she saw...") creates rhythm, the pervasive filtering ("She tried to scry," "Lyra felt") throughout the text creates a "telling" drag. The prose is polished but lacks the density and immediacy required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "Guardian of the Artifact" trope is standard, though the subversion—that the artifact wants to be given away—adds a nice layer. The mechanics of the shadows providing the revelation offers a specific, fresh image within a traditional frame.</comment>
