<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct, consistent protagonist driven by a clear intellectual want ("mathematics of emotion"). His "borrowing" trait adds texture, though he functions more as an archetypal observer than a character forced into deep internal conflict. Anya serves effectively as the subject, validating his goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from a clear inciting incident to a decisive closure via Resonant Reconfiguration. The magic system follows an internal logic that pays off in the final beat. The causality holds up well under the "scientific magic" premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("topaz walls," "shimmering air"), establishing a distinct mood. However, the descriptions sometimes lean toward the ornamental rather than strictly constraining the action, serving more as a backdrop than an active force until the press operates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: Elias seeks data, Anya seeks relief. The escalation through the mechanical process creates adequate tension. The cost—Anya's alienation from her own grief—is a sophisticated, felt price that elevates the resolution beyond a simple fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of quantifying the intangible is handled with precision. The final image of the "fractal of impossible angles" perfectly crystallizes the central question of math versus emotion without resorting to a trite moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the genre. However, the shift in focalization from Elias's detached observation to Anya's internal realization at the end ("She was her grief, she realized...") is a slight breach of the established distance, acting as a functional baton pass rather than a seamlessly integrated POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from "purple" tendencies ("catching the last light... like honey," "precise echo of the ticking cosmos"). Clichés like "silence was deafening" and "silhouette of grief" detract from the otherwise high-concept imagery, lowering the score for line-level freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics with cosmic events is a fresh take on the "magic shop" trope. While the structure is traditional, the specific conceptual payoff—grief as geometry—feels ingenious and memorable.</comment>
