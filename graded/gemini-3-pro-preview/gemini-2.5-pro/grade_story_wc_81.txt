<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is precise and deeply integrated with the plot; Elias’s "tranquilly perceptive" nature drives the choice to investigate rather than panic. The internal conflict—official history vs. observed truth—is embodied in his specific actions, and the resolution (a quiet, solitary commitment to correction) perfectly fits his established personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is flawless: the blackout (inciting incident) provides the silence and darkness necessary to reveal the truth via the moss, leading directly to the closure. The ending is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist accepts the burden of a secret truth, shifting his entire purpose with legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the blackout and the "phosphorescent moss" are not just atmospheric but essential tools that shape the protagonist's tactics in the climax. The transition from the hum of generators to the "drip of condensation" effectively grounds the crisis in sensory specifics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined as the integrity of history versus a convenient lie, escalating quietly but significantly through the discovery of the stamp. The pressure is coherent under the causal lens, leading to a meaningful deepening of the protagonist's worldview, though the external opposition is passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "erasure vs. honest origin" emerges organically from the interaction with the props and setting, avoiding preachy exposition. The final image of the "dappled resolve" and the commitment to re-indexing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and appropriately elevated to match the scholarly protagonist ("sacrilege," "provenance"). The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering all sensory details—like the "shriek of wood"—through Elias’s distinct, logical sensitivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("shriek of wood," "ghost of an impression"). While highly competent, a few adjectival choices ("grand dome," "immense tome") lean slightly generic, keeping this just shy of the highest tier, but the "text-artifact" control is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a sunken library is a familiar trope, but the specific angle—using a blackout as a research tool rather than a survival crisis—feels fresh. The "quiet correction" resolution subverts the typical whistleblower climax, offering a distinct and satisfying intellectual victory.</comment>
