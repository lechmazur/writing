<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is anchored in a clear, traumatic backstory that drives the present-moment conflict. The physiological response to the trigger is well-dramatized, effectively moving beyond the brief clinical slip ("somatic markers") into embodied sensation ("ice bloomed," "jaw tightened").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a tight, coherent arc from inciting trigger to resolution via a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (Earned Stasis). The pacing is effective, allowing the internal crisis to peak and resolve within the scene's constraints without feeling rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is actively utilized as a tool for resolution; the sensory details of the soil and pine resin are not just atmospheric but functional in the protagonist's grounding technique. The contrast between the ancient pine and the modern drone serves the theme well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but made palpable through physical symptoms and the tactile engagement with the photograph. The escalation from sound to paralysis to active grounding provides a clear pressure gradient that is resolved through agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of persistence ("geology, not technology") is woven organically into the climax. The parallel between the Wollemi pine's survival and the protagonist's endurance creates a satisfying, resonant subtext without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, managing the shift from objective observation to subjective panic smoothly. The rhetorical balance in "It meant nothing. It meant everything" borders on cliché but fits the duality of the character's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high sensory density ("grit of soil," "hum of surf"). However, the use of "somatic markers"—a diagnostic label—during the peak tension beat creates a slight filter artifact, and the phrase "People said she was..." relies on passive telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the "gardener healing from trauma" trope is familiar, the specific inclusion of the Wollemi pine and the automated lighthouse adds fresh specificity. The execution of the panic attack is precise, elevating the premise.</comment>
