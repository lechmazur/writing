<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian’s intellectualization of grief ("algorithm of his sorrow") creates a barrier to visceral engagement, rendering the emotion theoretical rather than embodied. The resolution feels slightly too tidy and diagnostic, lacking the erratic messiness of genuine loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a frictionless success path where the ritual works perfectly on the first try ("The fit was perfect"), lacking narrative drag or unexpected complication. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the absence of resistance makes the resolution feel earned by procedure rather than struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is evocative, with specific details like the "taxidermist’s glass eye pair" and "cobalt blue tiles" grounding the abstract magic in tactile reality. The setting actively supports the tone and provides the necessary constraints for the ritual mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract without meaningful escalation or a credible threat of failure; the ritual proceeds without distinct pressure points or hard choices. The conflict is static, resolved by the smooth execution of a plan rather than a confrontation with the unexpected.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of mapping grief is coherent and visualized effectively, though the "living theorem" metaphor risks becoming overly cerebral. The ending achieves a "profound and stable understanding," successfully landing the thematic arc with clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending magical and mathematical diction to suit the protagonist's worldview. Narrative distance is controlled, though the "math of emotion" filter occasionally dampens immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical, though it occasionally relies on abstractions ("topography," "vector") that distance the reader from the physical action. Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, with no significant scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of mosaic magic, taxidermy eyes, and the geometry of grief creates a fresh, specific aesthetic. The concept of "quantifying the void" offers a unique, if slightly detached, angle on the familiar trope of grief processing.</comment>
