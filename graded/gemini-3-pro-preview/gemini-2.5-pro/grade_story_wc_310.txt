<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong, linking the coin mechanism directly to the specific auditory payoff. The prophecy effectively drives the Conceptual Repricing at closure, though its introduction via memory at the end feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "ambered field" and "crushed cosmos" provide a visceral, unique backdrop that mirrors the theme of preservation. The tactile grounding of the coins prevents the abstract setting from feeling weightless.</comment>
