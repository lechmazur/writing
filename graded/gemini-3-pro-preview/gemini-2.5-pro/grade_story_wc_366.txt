<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas is a consistent, grounded protagonist with a clear internal landscape. However, his motivation is delivered via exposition ("His motivation wasn't heroism but a desperate need...") rather than emerging solely through action, and the "fragile intimacy" is summarized rather than dramatized in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete and the causality is sound, moving from disruption to restoration. The score is limited by the summary of the physical journey ("The journey was a battle against wind and water") and the lack of mechanical friction during the climax; the repair is resolved too easily with a rag and a match.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, with specific details like the "Needle" and the "cobalt blue" glass anchoring the scene. The tactile focus on the stones and the machinery grounds the atmosphere effectively, though the "haunted" aspect of the lantern room feels like an unearned trope that is quickly dismissed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established, but the execution of the conflict lacks on-page pressure. The physical danger of the crossing is elided in summary, and the mechanical obstacle of the broken light offers no resistance, reducing the earned cost of the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of silent, distant connection resonates well, particularly through the stone stacking motif. The ending successfully reconfigures the relationship from active stewardship to memorial duty, landing a solid emotional closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. It occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought description ("haunted lantern room," "frenzy of foam") that distances the reader from the protagonist's grounded mechanic persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is competent and polished but relies on adjective-heavy telling ("absolute, terrifying darkness," "oppressive quiet"). The phrase "luminescent ache" feels tonally jarring and abstract, disrupting the otherwise physical grounding of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper dynamic is a familiar trope. While the "stone stacking" language adds a fresh, specific layer to the communication, the core narrative beats (anonymous bond, storm rescue, finding the logbook) follow a standard trajectory.</comment>
