<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear, but her interiority relies on summarized abstractions ("tyranny of indifference") rather than embodied struggle. The "underestimated" trait is asserted as a label rather than dramatized through specific interactions or near-misses that prove it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Excellent orientation and a clean causal chain drive the narrative efficiently from the inciting silence to the broadcast. The closure is a decisive, resonant act that alters the status quo, creating a legible "Charged Poise" ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "puddle map" relying on light reflections is a brilliant, specific sensory detail that grounds the setting. However, the use of "permacrete" (a Star Wars loan-word) and generic "patrol drones" leans too heavily on sci-fi defaults.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are established immediately by the network silence, creating clear situational pressure. The tension holds, though the antagonist remains an abstract force; the cost is implied by her exposure but not sharply felt in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but suffers from heavy-handed explication, using phrases like "sterile soil of apathy" and "tyranny of indifference." The narrative tells the reader the moral rather than allowing subtext to emerge organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent melancholic tone that suits the subject. It occasionally slips into over-familiar phrasing ("ghost in the machine"), but generally controls the atmosphere well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is generally strong, particularly in the "puddle map" sequence. However, the text is marred by clichés ("ghost in their machine," "sigh of corrosion") and some purple metaphors that distance the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "puddle map" concept is highly inventive and elevates the middle section significantly. The surrounding framework—a lone rebel broadcasting truth from a forgotten station—is a familiar genre trope executed with standard beats.</comment>
