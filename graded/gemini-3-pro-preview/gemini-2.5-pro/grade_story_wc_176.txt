<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist is consistent but static, lacking internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the scene. Emotions are labeled with abstract summary ("quiet peace," "snowmelt ardor") rather than embodied through difficult choices or reactions to pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, procedural structure (task setup → work → success) without meaningful obstacles or cost. While the closure provides a clear conceptual reconfiguration (sound to light to silver), the lack of friction makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and atmospheric ("phosphorescent threads of sea-kelp," "hollowed dome"), establishing a strong mood. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop and does not actively constrain the protagonist's tactics or force trade-offs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; there is no active opposition or risk of failure on the page. Escalation is indicated only by the passage of time ("hours bled"), lacking a decisive tightening of options or a moment of true jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of translation and memory is coherent, but the execution leans on sentimental assertion ("quiet sea of fulfillment") rather than subtext. The resonance is dampened by the absence of struggle or ethical complexity in the preservation process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately reverent, though it occasionally drifts into "workshop lyrical" abstractions ("ethereal waves"). The distance remains somewhat remote, observing the ritual rather than immersing the reader in the physical difficulty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is competent but marred by clichés ("sanctum held its breath," "hours bled") and the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor"). These artifacts disrupt immersion and flatten the line-level texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The specific mechanism of translation—punched card to kelp-rope weave to light to silver—is inventive and visually distinct. This ritualistic ingenuity elevates the otherwise familiar "lonely archivist" premise.</comment>
