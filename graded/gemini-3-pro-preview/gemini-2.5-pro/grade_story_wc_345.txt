<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters function as archetypes—the believer, the skeptic, the doer—without internal contradiction or deepening. The "strangers to family" dynamic is asserted in exposition rather than dramatized through friction or interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The plot follows a linear "fetch quest" structure where protagonists lack agency, merely executing the ghost's instructions. The climax—an "impossible climb"—is summarized rather than shown, dissipating tension before the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, with "petrified orchards" and "bruised-purple sky" establishing a consistent atmosphere. The specificity of the "butterfly garden watering bell" grounds the fantastical elements well, though some descriptions feel decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conflict is strictly external and logistical; the protagonists face physical exertion but no difficult trade-offs or moral dilemmas. The solution is provided entirely by the ghost's diagrams, removing the burden of discovery from the characters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of cooperation is delivered explicitly ("only succeed together") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending leans into sentimentality with the "Go home" message, resolving the struggle too neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative suffers from unmotivated head-hopping, shifting from Elara’s perspective to the ghost’s internal monologue ("He saw their potential") to explain the plot. This expository intrusion deflates the mystery and breaks the established limited voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought ("symphony of desperation," "rust and regret"), relying on adjectival density. The rhythm is competent, though the summary of the climactic climb feels rushed and lacks sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of a bell acting as a planetary tuning fork is imaginative and distinct. However, the "benevolent ghost guiding survivors" trope is played straight, without subversion or fresh emotional complexity.</comment>
