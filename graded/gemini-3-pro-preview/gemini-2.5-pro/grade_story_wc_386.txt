<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara functions as a competent archetype rather than a character in a crucible; she lacks the internal contradiction or personal stakes required for high-band scoring. Her motivation is stated ("to salvage something pure") but never tested by a difficult choice, resulting in a static emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent but linear, relying on a low-cost resolution where the protagonist’s power easily solves the problem. The closure is positive but lacks the "felt or conceptual cost" required by the rubric; the antagonist simply dissolves without forcing a trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "breath-hollowed" glacial shrine and the melted snow globe provide distinct, vivid anchoring that grounds the magical elements. However, the dreamscapes feel comparatively generic ("shimmering ocean"), and the sensory details occasionally lean into static description rather than constraining action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Conflict is severely under-pressured; the antagonist offers no effective resistance and evaporates immediately upon being challenged. The protagonist faces no genuine jeopardy or risk of failure, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of releasing trauma is clear but delivered through narrative assertion ("Elara understands," "Elara knows") rather than emergent subtext. The resolution—transforming the globe from prison to memorial—lands the concept, but the lack of struggle reduces its resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "vigil" tone, but maintains a high psychic distance that keeps the reader at arm's length. The "unseen director" perspective dilutes the immediacy of the confrontation, favoring observation over immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic with high readability, though it occasionally relies on overwrought phrasing ("walls weep history," "human eclipse") that feels decorative. Line-level momentum is generally good, but the "show-don't-tell" balance tips toward telling in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While the "glacier diver" aesthetic provides a fresh coat of paint, the underlying structure is a standard "ghost whisperer" procedural. The resolution follows a familiar trope of exposing a crime to banish a spirit, lacking a transgressive or specific twist to elevate the premise.</comment>
