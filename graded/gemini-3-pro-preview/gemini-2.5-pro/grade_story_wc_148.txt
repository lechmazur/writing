<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find a truth of his own is compelling, and the final choice to destroy the evidence to preserve that truth is a sophisticated, earned character beat. However, the score is capped by the High-Band Entry Gate due to line-level flaws in Q7. The interiority is strong, but the technical execution prevents a higher band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear inciting incident and a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to his father's legacy. The conceptual repricing at the end is excellent. Score capped at 8.7 due to Q7's failure to meet the strict technical gate for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable, with "copperlight repose" and the "jagged reef" creating a distinct, heavy mood that supports the theme. The specific detail of the confessional lattice is vivid. Capped by global technical gates despite the high quality of the setting work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: the need for personal truth versus the burden of a liar's reputation. The arrival of the coast guard provides effective time pressure, forcing a meaningful choice with lasting cost. High score potential limited only by the global cap from Q7.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus belief is handled with nuance; the protagonist accepts the role of the liar to protect the "hush," a satisfying subversion of his initial goal. The ending resonates well without moralizing. Capped by global technical gates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is generally distinct and atmospheric, but a significant POV slip in the second paragraph ("thread this labyrinth with your own story") breaks the first-person frame. This unmotivated shift in address disrupts the otherwise consistent narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally evocative, but a glaring verbatim repetition loop occurs in the third paragraph ("left ajar for decades" appears in two consecutive sentences). This artifact suggests a lack of proofreading and triggers the artifact penalty, preventing the story from reaching the highest bands globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse preserving a murder in "amber light" via a confessional screen is highly original and haunting. The synthesis of the "cry wolf" motif with a supernatural anomaly feels fresh. Technical flaws in execution slightly dampen the impact.</comment>
