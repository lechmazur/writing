<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's internal landscape is rendered with specific, thematic details ("caesura in a line of forgotten verse") that align well with the baroque setting. The shift from "defunct" resignation to a "quiet war" provides a clear arc, though the emotional realization relies on a sentimental vision rather than an earned internal struggle or hard choice in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative is linear and coherent, but the climax relies on the shard magically revealing the exact truth Kaelen desires without requiring a significant sacrifice or clever manipulation. The resolution feels gifted by the "temporal squall" phenomenon rather than forged by the protagonist's agency, and the "cost" of the revelation is negligible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively blending the "baroque excess" of the asteroid with the sci-fi concept of visible time ("starship blooming like a metal flower"). The environment successfully pressures the protagonist to act (covering mirrors), grounding the high-concept elements in tangible behavior.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>External stakes are low; the threat of the "chorus of ghosts" is managed easily with velvet cloths, and the rival Valerius is an abstract, off-page presence. The primary conflict is resolved too neatly by the shard's vision, lacking a moment where the protagonist's theory is genuinely tested or where he must pay a price to prove it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of "art as resistance" is clear and resonant, fitting the prompt's constraints well. However, the execution leans toward the didactic ("revolution did not always require a gun"), and the vision of the ancients as weeping poets feels overly romanticized and convenient for Kaelen's argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent elevated tone that suits the "baroque" subject matter. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Kaelen's worldview, effectively filtering technical details through his poetic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmic and evocative, with strong imagery ("sliver of frozen light"). However, the text suffers from a density of adjective-noun pairings ("hushed archives," "dusty debating halls," "sterile data") that occasionally slows momentum and feels ornamental rather than urgent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The combination of "baroque asteroid" and "temporal squall" offers a fresh aesthetic. However, the core narrative—a weary scholar vindicated by a magical relic that proves the ancients were peaceful artists—is a familiar and somewhat safe trope that lacks a subverisve or complicating twist.</comment>
