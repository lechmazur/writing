<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair is a distinct, engaging protagonist whose method—the loop pedal exorcism—provides specific, embodied characterization. However, the ending relies on a cliché "tired smile," and the antagonist's dialogue ("Stillness. Completion. Truth.") feels slightly stock. The character work is solid but lacks the deeper, contradictory nuance required for the highest bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and logical, successfully employing a Causal/Situational hybrid lens where the method directly leads to the resolution. The "refuted by perspective" closure lands well conceptually, though the speed of the entity's collapse feels somewhat convenient. The causal chain holds, but the brevity limits the complexity of the struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is established with excellent sensory specificity; the "silver mesh," the "red eye" of the pedal, and the "perfect cube" create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the characters and supports the sonic nature of the conflict. A strong example of using a micro-setting to ground high-concept action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, and the escalation through layered sound is inventive. However, the conflict resolves rapidly; the entity crumbles after a single rhetorical trap, reducing the felt sense of risk or cost. A deeper back-and-forth or a more visceral price paid by Alistair would elevate the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central theme of complexity versus stagnation is well-integrated into the action of the loop pedal. However, the score is capped by a significant "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph; explicitly stating "Sometimes the loudest arguments are the ones we have with ourselves" flattens the subtext into a moral, reducing the ending's resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, matching Alistair's intellectual approach to exorcism. The control of distance is stable, keeping us firmly in Alistair's perception. The voice falters slightly only in the didactic nature of the final dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent and dense, but occasionally overwrought with phrases like "chiasmus of perception" and "sonic tapestry," which border on purple. While there are no mechanical errors, the reliance on slightly academic or stock metaphors in high-pressure beats distracts from the immediacy of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a "loop pedal exorcist" fighting a "dimensional anchor" entity with rhetoric is highly original and fresh. This ingenious synthesis of theology, audio tech, and philosophy stands out significantly, even if the execution leans on a few familiar tropes.</comment>
