<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara is a competent and active protagonist with clear motivation, but her internal landscape relies on stock physical markers ("knot of dread," "heart hammering") rather than specific, contradictory character friction. She faces the external threat with heroic resolve, but the absence of a difficult internal trade-off or doubt limits the depth of the characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal drive from the identification of the signal to the deployment of the counter-measure. However, the resolution is frictionless; the "press button to solve riot" mechanic works too instantly and conveniently, lacking the causal complication or "cost" usually required for a higher-stakes closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is a highlight, effectively grounding the "cosmic" stakes in a tactile, analog reality ("bakelite cool," "vacuum tubes"). The atmosphere of "ethereal grit" is vivid, using sensory details like the smell of ink and ozone to create a distinct, lived-in texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the societal stakes are high (civil unrest), the immediate pressure on the protagonist is low; she operates from a safe sanctuary, watching the danger on a monitor. The climax involves executing a prepared plan without unexpected resistance or a forced sacrifice, resulting in a low-cost victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "hum vs. shout" and quiet rebellion is coherent and lands clearly in the final image of the crowd calming. The delivery is slightly didactic ("sanded smooth just enough for them to see the person on the other side"), but the central concept of subtle influence resonates well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated tone that fits the "cosmic/analog" juxtaposition well. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Elara’s experience, though some descriptions lean toward the melodramatic ("cold static of the cosmos").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("chaotic ocean of paper"). However, the reliance on cliché somatic markers ("knot of dread," "heart hammering") and occasional adjectival clutter ("clever, insidious things") holds back the line-level score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of star signals influencing human behavior is a solid sci-fi concept, though the "lone operator soothes the mob with a frequency" is a familiar trope. The specific flavor of "cosmic tricksters" versus analog radio tech adds a welcome layer of ingenuity.</comment>
