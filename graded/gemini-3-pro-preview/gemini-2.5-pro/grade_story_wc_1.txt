<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Internal conflict is well-rendered, moving from trauma-induced paralysis to creative reclamation. The shift in motivation is earned through the investigative process, and the final choice to light the kiln feels psychologically grounded and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central plot device—smugglers using ephemeral, weather-dependent frost patterns as a permanent map—strains plausibility and breaks the narrative's internal logic. While the closure unit (the art piece) is structurally sound, the causal bridge relies on "poetic logic" that contradicts the gritty premise of the ledger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the canyon's specific features (frost, light) drive the discovery. Sensory details are vivid ("blackened brick," "sentinel rock"), though occasionally the description slows momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Internal stakes are clear and escalate well towards the decision to use the kiln. However, the external antagonist (smugglers) remains entirely retrospective and distant, reducing the immediate pressure of the "retracing" sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The themes of trauma and transformation are woven throughout, but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("a testament not to what was lost, but to the purpose...") rather than letting the final image speak for itself. This moralizing flattens the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely attuned to the protagonist's artistic perception. It effectively manages the shift from observation to action without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative ("ghost-heat"), but slips into cliché ("hummed with a secret energy") and occasional ambiguity ("luminous glass artist"—is the artist luminous, or the glass?).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass art and frost patterns is imaginative. However, the reliance on a somewhat magical interpretation of a criminal ledger prevents the ingenuity from feeling fully earned or grounded.</comment>
