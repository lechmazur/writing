<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic label-speak ("proprioceptively enhanced state," "conditioned terror"), which creates emotional distance and triggers the rubric's specific deduction for this flaw. While the shift from victim to researcher is a clear stance change, the character feels more like a vessel for the concept than a living person making difficult choices under pressure. The internal monologue is analytical to a fault, dampening the visceral impact of his trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative arc where sensory details and memory fragments build to a Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure is legible—Kaelen recontextualizes his situation from punishment to experiment—and the drive lens holds. However, the pivotal realization relies on a hallucinated voice ("Mercy is a rounding error") rather than a discovery made solely through the protagonist's active agency, which softens the causal link.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The integration of the proprioceptive enhancement into the setting description is excellent; details like "micro-gram accuracy" and the "velvet" texture of moss ground the abstract sci-fi elements in immediate physical sensation. The environment and body act as constraints that shape the narrative experience, satisfying the criteria for a high score. The setting is not just a backdrop but a filter through which the character processes reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the psychological pressure is evident, the conflict remains largely intellectual and abstract ("solve the equation"), lacking visceral, on-page stakes that force difficult trade-offs. The escalation is textural—increasing hum, clearer memories—rather than a tightening of options that forces a sacrifice. The "perish in the static" threat feels declared rather than demonstrated through immediate danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit theme statements ("Mercy is a rounding error," "The ultraviolet penance wasn't a punishment"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the story's meaning rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own, which triggers a penalty for moralizing/explaining at the closure. The theme is intriguing but is delivered as a lecture rather than an emergent property of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctly "enhanced," fitting the protagonist's state of cold clarity. However, the register occasionally drifts into authorial abstraction ("decanted into a hostile dreamscape") that feels written rather than perceived. The distance is stable, but the vocabulary sometimes overtakes the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is functional but suffers from "purple" tendencies and abstract metaphors ("symphony of self-knowledge," "liquid intensity") that reduce clarity. There is a reliance on adjective-noun pairings that slows the momentum of the physical action. The line-level craft is competent but draws too much attention to its own construction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The core concept of hyper-proprioception as a byproduct of torture is a fresh and specific twist on the "enhanced survivor" trope. The "mathematics of mercy" offers a unique intellectual framing for the protagonist's struggle. The synthesis of these elements feels original and avoids generic dystopian clichés.</comment>
