<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael's specific trait ("dusk noticer") is expertly utilized to drive the plot's central discovery, satisfying the "competence under pressure" requirement. Motivation is clear, though the interiority occasionally leans on abstract labels ("shape of hope") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean with a distinct "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the memory is restored but irrevocably altered. The causal chain is strong, linking the video diagnosis directly to the resolution, though the "stone-as-conduit" mechanism is slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "blooming library" concept is vivid, and the contrast between the organic vines and the digital archive is handled well. The specific diagnostic details in the video footage (curling fingers) provide excellent, grounded specificity amidst the more ethereal setting elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are high and personal, focused on a binary choice with irreversible consequences (delete vs. integrate). The cost is legible and felt: the loss of the idealized "happy" memory in exchange for a "fragile" truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of integration is potent, but the narrative over-articulates the moral in the final paragraphs ("saved not by erasing the darkness but by accepting it"). This explicit summary flattens the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyrical voice fits the protagonist's role as a curator of memories. There is some minor distance caused by filter verbs ("Kael noticed," "He saw") during the pivotal observation beat, but the tone remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, maintaining good momentum. However, a few phrases lean into cliché or purple description ("poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose," "mask of a smile") which detracts from the otherwise sharp imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the "memory librarian" trope is familiar, the specific forensic method of comparing micro-gestures in old footage to new constructs adds a fresh, tactile layer of ingenuity to the execution.</comment>
