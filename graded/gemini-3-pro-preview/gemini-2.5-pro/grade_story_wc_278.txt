<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but the backstory of finding letters "from another life" is confusing and underdeveloped, serving as a convenient plot device rather than deepening the character. The emotional resolution feels somewhat performative rather than a hard-won internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a significant coincidence (finding his own letters in a purchased desk) to launch the plot, breaking causal credibility. The climax employs symbolic logic—scratching a casing to recode firmware—that lacks grounding in the established world rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and consistent, with specific details like the "prehistoric gnat" and the sterile server room creating a distinct mood. Some descriptions, however, lean into cliché ("sky the color of a deep bruise").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The protagonist faces minimal external resistance or complication; the solution is procedural and executed without significant doubt, risk, or a "try-fail" cycle. The emotional stakes are high, but the on-page struggle is low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of "mapping a ghost" is coherent, but the execution is on-the-nose ("charting a course for a ghost"). The ending ("Papa") veers into unearned sentimentality that simplifies the complex grief established earlier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, effectively maintaining a sombre, lyrical tone ("meteor hush") that suits the subject matter. The shift from the tattoo studio to the lab is handled with smooth tonal continuity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative ("needle a whisper"), but suffers from occasional stock imagery ("thin as a moth's wing") and abstract telling ("dissonance of old guilt made manifest").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing and digital exorcism is a creative concept. However, the narrative arc follows a standard "healing a ghost" trope, and the mechanics of the resolution feel familiar.</comment>
