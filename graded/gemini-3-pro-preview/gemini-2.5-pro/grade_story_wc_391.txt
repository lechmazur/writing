<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s internal conflict is described through metaphors ("wild animal") rather than demonstrated via a difficult on-page choice. She executes a pre-calculated plan without facing a moment of doubt or trade-off that would test her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path where the plan works perfectly without complication or unexpected variables. The closure lacks a legible on-page cost, as the victory is achieved cleanly through waiting and execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The integration of the "wet sheen" on the viaduct with the celestial alignment is excellent, making the physical environment the key to the plot's resolution. Sensory details like the hum and the silence are vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high in theory but low in practice, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma during the scene. The escalation is a ticking clock without an antagonist or obstacle to force a new tactic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of natural cycles disrupting technological control is coherent and resonates in the final silence. However, the internal theme of "sculpting patience" is delivered via exposition rather than subtextual emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the high-concept setting. It occasionally leans into elevated abstractions ("aching simplicity") that distance the reader slightly from grounded interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished with good density. A few stock metaphors ("wild animal clawing," "heart skipping a beat") dilute the otherwise specific imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mechanism of using a moon's reflection on wet iron to create a harmonic interference is a genuinely inventive twist on the "disable the shields" trope, elevating the premise significantly.</comment>
