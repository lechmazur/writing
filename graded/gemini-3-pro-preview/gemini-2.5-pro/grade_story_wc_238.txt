<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Julian’s motivation is clear and drives the scene, but his internal arc resolves through summary ("profound acceptance") rather than a specific dramatized micro-choice. The "deluge" of sensation is described with abstract labels ("bitter taste," "heartbreaking strain") rather than particularized memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). The cost is established early (exorbitant fee + invasion of sister's privacy) and paid to achieve the result. The inciting incident and climax are well-paced within the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Specific details like "iron gall ink" and the "oscillator" ground the scene well. However, the opening line ("air... was a held breath") is a worn cliché that weakens the immediate atmospheric authority.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly defined: the physical destruction of the archive (ticking clock) vs. the need for emotional resolution. The trade-off—dignity and privacy for a chance at connection—is a strong, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme is heavily explicated through dialogue rather than subtext. Vex’s final speech ("A memory is a phantom limb...") is a direct thesis statement that flattens the resonance of the ending into a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic descriptors ("library of his sister Elara’s soul," "agonizing miracle"). Vex’s dialogue feels stylized to the point of artificiality, serving as a delivery system for metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Competent momentum, but marred by significant clichés ("held breath," "gravel wrapped in silk"). Abstract nouns ("desperation," "forgiveness," "acceptance") often replace concrete imagery in pivotal emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A solid synthesis of prompt elements, though the "technology-assisted seance" is a familiar trope. The execution is functional but lacks a distinct, fresh angle on the concept of grief beyond standard genre conventions.</comment>
