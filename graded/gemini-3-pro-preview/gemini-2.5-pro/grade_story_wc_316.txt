<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is legible, but the "phantom limb" of love feels abstract and told rather than viscerally embodied; the transition from absolute numbness relies on dredging up this convenient, nebulous memory without sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (responsibility replacing numbness) lands clearly. However, Jin's sudden passivity during the climax—stopping simply to watch—weakens the causal chain of the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The setting is established with vivid, surreal imagery like the "floating rock" and "temporal static." However, some descriptions, such as the sun "remembering its name," veer into over-stylization that distracts from the immediate scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central conflict is present, but the antagonist offers little resistance at the peak; Jin's capitulation to the "mesmerizing" light renders the "custody battle" low-pressure and resolves the external threat too easily.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The thematic shift from a desperate desire for sensation to a terrifying sense of responsibility offers a resonant, non-clichéd answer to the protagonist's condition, elevating the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent with the meditative setting, effectively mirroring the protagonist's detached state without slipping into inconsistent interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on stock phrasing ("mask of serene disapproval," "smooth as a river stone") that dulls the otherwise creative imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego death and cloning offers a fresh take on identity, though the execution follows a fairly standard "forbidden ritual" structure with a convenient bystander antagonist.</comment>
