<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Amal’s motivation is fierce and clearly defined, driving the narrative from the first line. However, her interiority occasionally leans into melodramatic abstraction ("needle in her soul") rather than grounded emotional reaction, making her feel slightly more like a vessel for the concept than a living person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is cleanly structured around the "cooling" window, providing effective urgency. While the resolution—finding metaphysical coordinates via mathematical input—strains causal credibility by treating metaphor as literal physics, it adheres to the story's internal logic and delivers a clear sense of closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional, utilizing the "oppressive silence" and the "blue lie" of Earth to reflect the protagonist's internal state. The cooling circuit breakers serve as an effective environmental constraint that dictates the scene's pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The external pressure of the stabilizing coolant creates a functional ticking clock that forces the protagonist to act. The escalation relies heavily on internal processing and typing rather than difficult active choices, but the cost—reliving the trauma to fuel the machine—is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of stolen potential is powerful but articulated through heavy-handed exposition ("theft on a cosmic scale") rather than subtext. The phrase "titular perturbation" is a jarring meta-intrusion that breaks immersion, reading as an unedited nod to a title or prompt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a high-intensity, poetic register that suits the "obsessed scientist" archetype. While it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("festering heart"), the tone generally supports the high-stakes, metaphysical nature of the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose contains vivid imagery but is marred by a significant proofreading artifact (" [ intricately tangible"), likely a bracketed draft note or syntax error. Additionally, the misuse of "titular" and some overwrought phrasing ("shriek of a missile," "satori") detract from the line-level precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of applying perturbation theory to track the "physics of lost potential" is a fresh and inventive synthesis of hard sci-fi and metaphysical fantasy. It successfully elevates a standard revenge/grief trope into something conceptually distinct.</comment>
