<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("methodical curiosity," "shielded openness") rather than embodied action or struggle. The protagonist lacks internal contradiction or conflicting desires; her path is a straight line of competent investigation without emotional risk or personal cost. The moment of connection ("tremor of connection") is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through a high-stakes dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the Conceptual Repricing closure (tear as threshold) lands effectively. However, the investigation lacks friction; the jump from a map tear to locating two specific canisters of footage in county archives happens via convenient summary, bypassing potential obstacles that would generate narrative drive. The causality is functional but lacks the texture of genuine difficulty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details in the workshop ("archival glue," "hum of dehumidifiers") provide excellent grounding. The description of the henge footage is vivid and precise ("lichen clung... like faded paint"), successfully using the visual medium to anchor the mystery. The shift between the tactile map and the projected light is handled well spatially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract and purely intellectual ("landscape of knowledge"), with no tangible cost for failure or time pressure. The protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs; the investigation proceeds smoothly to its conclusion. Without a "felt cost" or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the escalation feels flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is consistent but delivered through heavy-handed explication ("The silence had been interpreted," "The silence of the films screamed at her"). The story frequently tells the reader the significance of the imagery rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the action. The final annotation strikes a good resonant note, but the buildup is overly directive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the protagonist's understanding and motivation. The psychic distance is often too great, summarizing the emotional import of scenes ("she understood that her job was not...") rather than immersing the reader in the immediate experience of discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable, with moments of strong imagery ("spider-scratch of ink"). However, it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("physical wound in the landscape of knowledge") and abstract metaphor that distances the reader. The mechanics are sound, but the density of adjectives and "told" emotions slows the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography and forensic observation of nature (lichen growth) is a fresh and specific angle on the "found mystery" trope. The central conceit—a tear as a deliberate preservation act—is ingenious. The execution is safer than the concept, but the core idea demonstrates genuine originality.</comment>
