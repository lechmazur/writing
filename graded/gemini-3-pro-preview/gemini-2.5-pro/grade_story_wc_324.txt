<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elias is defined primarily by occupational labels ("technician of sorrow," "specialist in the cartography of loss") rather than embodied struggle. The secondary character, Leo, lacks resistance; his immediate acceptance of a stranger's supernatural message feels like "perfect emotional calibration" rather than a genuine human reaction, reducing the scene's friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending where the problem is solved without cost or complication. The closure acts as a soft reset for the secondary character, lacking the "felt cost" or "decisive change" required for higher bands; the resolution is tidy rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid but relies on slightly generic, melodramatic descriptors ("cathedral of glass," "echoes went to die") that border on cliché. While the environment is established, it serves as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Escalation is minimal; the "intensifying" pulse signals urgency, but the protagonist faces no obstacle in delivering the message, and the recipient offers no resistance. The conflict resolves through a simple conversation, lacking the tightening of options or the "meaningful deepening" required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme of connection across the void is coherent and central, supported by the heartbeat motif. However, the execution leans toward sentimentality ("lullaby of thumps," "sending you her peace") and offers a reassuring moral rather than a complex resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controlled but tends toward a breathless, elevated register that creates distance. The reliance on explaining the protagonist's nature ("He wasn’t a medium... he was a technician") rather than dramatizing it weakens the immediacy of the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density ("sliver of time wedged," "reeling hush," "staccato of fear," "paper-thin map"). These frequent, decorative figurative flourishes obscure the action and create a "purple" texture that violates the economy bias of the rubric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" using obsolete tech is an inventive spin on the mediumship trope. However, the execution plays out as a standard "ghost whisperer" scenario without subverting expectations or adding a fresh, specific complication to the genre conventions.</comment>
