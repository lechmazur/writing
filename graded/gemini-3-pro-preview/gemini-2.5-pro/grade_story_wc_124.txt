<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias is a coherent focalizer with a clear internal contradiction (seeking a scent while being "aromatically cautious"). The "lantern broker" role serves as a strong thematic anchor for his preference for shadows, though it doesn't tactically shape his actions in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, moving from the setup of the experiment to the revelation and emotional release. The coincidence of the flower blooming exactly as the message is revealed is convenient but functionally paces the climax well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset; the "humid air" and "fractured... crystalline splinters" of light create a tangible, immersive atmosphere. The setting actively pressures the protagonist by housing the catalyst for his pain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but legible; the tension comes from his resistance to the very thing he seeks. The escalation is subtle, moving from caution to the inevitable surrender to the scent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of preserved memory mirrors the extinct plant well. However, the ending relies on explicit emotional summary ("profound, cleansing sorrow," "tribute") rather than letting the final image carry the resonance alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and maintains a consistent, slightly melancholic tone. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("He believed," "He saw") that creates unnecessary distance in high-emotion beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While generally competent, the prose relies on clichés ("heart a frantic drum") and abstractions ("ineffably soft," "agonizing slowness") that dull the impact. The final paragraph over-explains the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "extinct plant" concept with the UV-revealed message offers a fresh mechanical twist on the Proustian memory trope. The emotional arc is traditional, but the specific mechanics give it a unique flavor.</comment>
