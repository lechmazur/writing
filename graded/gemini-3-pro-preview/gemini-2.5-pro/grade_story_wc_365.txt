<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s role as a sensory map maker is thoroughly integrated into his interiority and problem-solving, grounding abstract sci-fi concepts in concrete perception. His motivation is clear and poignant, driving the transition from passive observer to active agent effectively. The resignation in his final choice—paying a debt to a ghost—adds necessary emotional weight to the technical resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient, pivoting cleanly from atmospheric setup to a high-stakes realization that the "echo" is an active threat. The logic of the recurring pulse justifies the timing of the climax, avoiding the trap of convenient coincidence. Closure is achieved through a distinct Decisive Change that alters the state of the world and the protagonist's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is visceral and active, treating the spaceport as a character that "speaks" through specific sensory details like ozone and rust. The layering of the pristine and ruined versions of the bay effectively dramatizes the multiverse concept within a single physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate sharply from a personal, melancholy quest to a tangible structural threat, managed well within the short word count. The cost is palpable and thematic: by saving his reality, Kael must silence the echoes that connected him to his sister, trading intimacy for safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story elegantly intertwines the physics of resonance with the psychology of grief. The resolution—accepting a "clean, neutral" silence over the comfort of haunting—offers a mature, non-literal answer to the central tension of withheld truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric filter appropriate for a "cartographer of ghosts," blending technical language with lyricism. The perspective remains tightly controlled, ensuring that the sensory exposition feels like character experience rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("acridly organic"). A few phrases in the mid-section, such as "universal language for imminent catastrophe" and "crushing weight," lean slightly on abstraction or cliché where specific sensory mapping would have been sharper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the "grief across the multiverse" trope is familiar, the specific lens of sensory cartography and the mechanic of redirecting echoes provide a fresh, distinct execution. The synthesis of ghost story and hard sci-fi feels organic and earned.</comment>
