<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kaelen demonstrates clear agency and a Decisive Change at the closure, but his internal landscape lacks contradiction; he is singular in purpose from the start without competing impulses to create depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent with a well-earned Decisive Change at the ending. The "magic logic" of buttons decoding whispers holds consistently within the fable frame, and closure lands with clear conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "resin-caked windows" and the specific textures of the buttons effectively ground the abstract, magical premise in a tangible physical reality that constraints the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The draining hourglass creates effective ticking-clock pressure that forces the protagonist's work to a crisis point. The stakes are legible, and the resolution is driven by the protagonist's completed labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central concept is resonant, but the story relies on explicit summarization ("prophecy... was a comma") to articulate the theme rather than trusting the subtext, reducing the ending's power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, elevated, and atmospheric, suiting the fable mode well. It maintains distance effectively, though it occasionally favors abstract descriptors over grounded interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished, but the phrase "source code of their fate" is a jarring register clash (tech metaphor in fantasy) that breaks immersion. Some filtering ("He saw how") flattens the immediate impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conceit of cataloguing mundane buttons to unscramble auditory prophecy is highly imaginative and distinct, successfully transforming standard prophecy tropes into something fresh and tactile.</comment>
