<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Samira is a distinct, grounded protagonist whose internal conflict (PTSD vs. presence) drives the narrative agency. Her choice to move the ceremony is motivated by a coherent worldview ("anchor optimism in realism"). While some emotional processing is slightly over-articulated via labels ("somatic markers"), the physical embodiment of her trauma remains strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is solid, moving efficiently from the inciting pressure (storm/board) to a decisive action (relocation) and a resonant closure. The ending functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the photo and the "pearl" crystallize her stance on memory and safety. The pacing fits the short form perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral, acting as both a physical constraint (the storm forcing the move) and a thematic echo ("glass ribcage"). The "pearl of stillness" and the glasshouse are not just backdrops but active tools that shape the climax and the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The internal escalation (drone trigger, somatic management) is excellent, but the external conflict with the Chair is resolved a bit too easily; he folds immediately upon seeing the view. While the "man vs. nature" pressure works, the lack of stiffer interpersonal resistance keeps the stakes feeling slightly quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of integrating trauma rather than hiding it is handled with sophistication, avoiding easy answers. The final image of the photograph—held but not drowned—offers a profound, non-literal resolution to the central tension. A few mid-story lines feel slightly aphoristic, but the ending resonates deeply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely focalized, maintaining a "glass-like" fragility that suits the setting. The narrative distance is well-controlled. The integration of technical terms ("somatic markers") into this poetic voice is handled functionally, though it creates a slight textural bump.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and evocative ("glass ribcage," "shutter catching light"). However, minor filter verbs ("she felt her body freeze," "she read tremor") distance the reader from the immediate sensation in key moments. Occasional phrasing veers into sentimentality ("making people taller inside themselves").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone survivor narrative with a traditional lighthouse/arboretum setting offers a fresh, specific angle on trauma. The "pearl of stillness" provides a unique central image that grounds the concept effectively. It feels distinct and memorable.</comment>
