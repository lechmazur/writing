<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jessa is a competent archetype rather than a specific individual; her "underestimated" nature is asserted but not dramatized through status dynamics or contrast. She lacks internal contradiction or a meaningful flaw; her choices are tactical rather than moral or emotional, leaving the character feeling like a vehicle for the plot rather than a living person paying a price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative relies on "magical" convenience rather than hard causality; the "puddle map" is poetic but logically opaque, and the climax dissolves the threat via the sudden arrival of neighbors who "break the squads with witness." In a regime that erases whole towns, the idea that mere witnessing stops the squads feels naive and unearned, undercutting the narrative cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric details are vivid ("mineral light," "bone-colored ceramic"), establishing a distinct dystopic texture. However, the descriptor "auric" repeats distractingly, and the setting sometimes feels more like a poetic backdrop than a physical space constraining the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The opposition (revision squads) behaves like faceless stormtroopers who are too easily "fooled by a sky printed underfoot" and stopped by light. The escalation lacks genuine pressure because the protagonist’s victory relies on the antagonists faltering for poetic reasons ("scripts do not include how to arrest light") rather than a strategic checkmate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit labels ("tyranny of indifference") rather than subtext, violating the show-don't-tell principle. The ending moralizes directly ("stubbornness is a kind of love"), reducing complex resonance to a summary lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on high-lyric register, which creates distance during action beats. The filter of "poetic" observation ("hour when plans unravel") sometimes obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose suffers from simile overload ("peeled like molting snakes," "sigh open like a confession," "flutter like uncertain moths"), which clogs the rhythm and reduces impact. High-pressure beats are diluted by abstract metaphors ("spilling the grid's music"), sacrificing clarity for ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story recycles standard dystopian tropes—memory erasure, underground rebels, relay nodes—without a fresh transformative angle. The "puddle map" is a novel image but operates on dream logic that clashes with the tech-grit setting.</comment>
