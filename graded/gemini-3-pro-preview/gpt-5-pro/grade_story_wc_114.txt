<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is deeply embodied, blending the fever state with the mechanical environment to dramatize grief. The protagonist's shift from suppression to action is earned through the tactile ritual of weighing the dust, making the internal change visible and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is flawless; the backstory of the "smudge" integrates perfectly with the present urgency of the convoy. The closure is a decisive, active warning that carries clear professional and emotional stakes, satisfying the causal drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral, not just atmospheric; the "desiccant scale" and "fault-tolerant oracle" enable the central turn. The interplay between the technical (anemometers, glide plane) and the organic (ribs, wool, saxifrage) creates a vivid, lived-in reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate (the climbing convoy) and personal (legacy and guilt), creating a clear "now or never" pressure. The cost of the decision—curses from the valley and the admission of failure—is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The themes of "occupying margins" and the weight of silence resonate through specific objects rather than abstract preaching. The "weighing of the smudge" acts as a powerful objective correlative for the central thematic argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, merging scientific precision with lyrical sorrow ("clicks its relays like teeth"). The personification of the machine fits the narrator's fevered psychological state, maintaining a consistent and unique perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic ("answers as wind, not words"), with high information density and strong imagery. The refrain of "swallowed truth" is slightly repetitive but functions effectively as a fever-mantra without breaking flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept—weighing graphite dust to determine the "mass of silence"—is a brilliant, non-obvious synthesis of the scientific and the emotional. It elevates a standard warning scenario into a unique literary moment.</comment>
