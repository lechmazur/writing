<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific perceptual constraint (face blindness) is integrated well into the prose and worldview. However, the emotional anchor regarding the father's accident feels inserted rather than earned by the immediate pressure, reading more as a backstory justification than a driver of the present choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is strong, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the room is ontologically transformed before destruction. The causal link between the coin's "coordinates" and the artistic act of painting a sky is poetic but mechanically tenuous; the leap from "wandering stars" to painting guidance relies on dream logic rather than established causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, grounding the surreal premise with tactile details like the "botanical index of mosses" and the "tree trunk" architecture. The atmosphere effectively supports the "held breath" tension, though some descriptions lean toward over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The external pressure (demolition timer) is clear and escalates appropriately through sensory cues like the siren and crane. The stakes remain largely internal and aesthetic; while the tension holds, the lack of a sharper, externalized cost or obstacle limits the dramatic voltage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The themes of impermanence, memory, and the "face" of a space are woven organically into the narrative. The final image successfully reframes the loss of the building as a completed portrait, offering a resonant answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent high-lyric register that matches the protagonist's artistic sensibility. However, the "poetic artist" filter is at times too thick, creating a slight distance between the reader and the physical immediacy of the action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Figurative language density is excessive, tripping the "overwriting" check. The reliance on simile ("like pollen," "like rain," "like tides," "like a held oath") creates a repetitive rhythmic scaffold that clogs momentum. Pruning the metaphorical clutter would allow the strong underlying imagery to breathe.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a heist-like setup (safe, coin) with a lyrical elegy for a dying building is inventive and fresh. The premise avoids standard tropes, though the execution relies slightly on convenient "secret map" mechanics to bridge the gap between plot and theme.</comment>
