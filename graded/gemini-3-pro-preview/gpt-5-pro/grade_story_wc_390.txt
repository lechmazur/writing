<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal duality—lighthouse logic versus crypt emotion—creates a compelling, specific interiority. The antagonist's rapid shift from greed to grief is earned through the shared sensory experience, though his initial archetypal nature limits the score slightly. The emotional arc is authentic, grounding the magical realism in felt human cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from a tense standoff to a resonant resolution without wasted motion. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "theft" is replaced by a shared burden, satisfying the stakes with visible emotional cost. The mechanism of resolution relies heavily on the artifact's established rules, but the execution remains causal and grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated; the "drift-ice marina" is not just a backdrop but a participant, with the ice and pilings acting as tuning forks for the plot. Sensory details like "brittle chimes" and "burnished the ice like vellum" create a visceral, specific atmosphere that constrains and colors every action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high—the rupture of a harbor and the weight of a soul—creating coherent pressure throughout. The conflict escalation is quiet but intense, pivoting on a choice of vulnerability over violence. The cost is paid on the page through the reliving of trauma, validating the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central theme of "remorse into navigation" is intertwined beautifully with the plot and setting, offering a profound, non-literal answer to the premise. The story resists a tidy moral, instead offering "clarity, which is sometimes the only kindness," a sophisticated and earned thematic landing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and lyrical, perfectly matching the "azure-coat engineer" persona. The shift from technical observation to emotional resonance is seamless, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature even during the height of the fantastical climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery ("desire clipped to bone," "throat clearing to speak"). The line-level craft is exceptional, though the metaphorical density occasionally borders on overwrought ("smile had the pallor of a net"), preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical engineering language with spiritual grief ("sonic absolution") creates a fresh, memorable conceit. The concept of a lighthouse keeper guarding a subterranean sound-crypt feels genuinely original and is executed with specific, non-generic details.</comment>
