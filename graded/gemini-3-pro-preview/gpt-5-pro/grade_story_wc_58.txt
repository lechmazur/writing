<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions primarily as a passive vessel for the concept; their motivation ("understand the geography of healing") is abstractly stated rather than dramatized through high-stakes pressure. The final choice to stay feels like a gentle drift in the current rather than a decision forged in a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The arrival of the letter resolves the central tension via off-screen convenience, contradicting the premise of isolation ("last ship," "storms ended trade") that necessitated the protagonist's role. This logic break undercuts the causality of the narrative, rendering the "living obituary" service retrospectively ornamental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The atmosphere of the "shadowed garden" is established with lush, consistent imagery that anchors the tone. While the setting is vivid, the reliance on metaphorical description ("brass polished by tears") occasionally floats above concrete, tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conflict remains low-simmer and atmospheric; the protagonist's unique method doesn't drive the resolution, as the problem (uncertainty) is solved by the postal service (the letter). The stakes of total separation deflate when it turns out communication channels are still open.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story explores resonance well but relies on explicit thesis statements ("I learn that healing is not a return") to deliver its meaning. Subtext is crowded out by the narrator explaining the theme directly to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "lonesome splendor" throughout. However, the high poetic register creates a psychic distance, feeling at times more like a performance of grief than an intimate experience of it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from simile fatigue, with eight distinct "like [noun]" constructions in a short space ("like hinges," "like owls," "like soldiers"), creating a repetitive cadence. Additionally, the phrase "projecting presence" is repeated four times as a mechanical tag, disrupting the narrative flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core concept of "obituaries for the living" is poignant and inventive. However, the execution leans into sentimental tropes (the miraculous letter, planting seeds of hope) that soften the gritty, tragic potential of the premise.</comment>
