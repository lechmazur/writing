<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and their motivation ("share light without fire") drives the narrative logic effectively. The emotional landscape is vivid, though the interiority occasionally leans into abstract labeling ("grief were pollen") rather than grounded reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and successfully executes a fable-like structure under an accumulative lens. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration of tradition—lands well, though the progression faces little causal resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific physics of the nebula (vapor, sonar, light) actively constrain the characters' methods. The environment is not just a backdrop but the primary tool for the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conflict is subtle and thematic; while the stakes of "safe light" are clear, the resolution comes smoothly with the gears meshing on the first try. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing the relic) rather than acutely felt in the moment of action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of transmission vs. repetition is strong, but the ending explicitly states the moral ("proof that inheritance can mean transmission...") rather than letting the image resonate. This explanatory finish reduces the subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and immersive, perfectly suiting the "sentimentalist" persona. However, the repetition of specific phrases ("quiet sigh of falling petals") breaks the narrative spell, making the control feel slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphor density is extremely high ("expression fractures into rain," "numbers becoming weather"), often obscuring clarity for the sake of poetic texture. Additionally, two required phrases are repeated verbatim ("approximates infinity," "quiet sigh of falling petals"), creating noticeable text loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork mechanics with a nebula garden creates a fresh, specific atmosphere. The "light without fire" concept offers a distinct and memorable angle on the prompt's elements.</comment>
