<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrator is defined largely by the prompt's label ("creeping normality noticer") rather than organic characterization, and the motivation is explicitly stated ("to find the sacred...") rather than purely dramatized. However, Maro’s confession about selling herbs to developers adds a necessary, albeit brief, layer of complicity and depth to the cast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The structure effectively follows a ritualistic arc—preparation, action, communion, departure—that suits the accumulative drive lens. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration of the space and the characters' commitment, offering a clear "Earned Stasis," though the narrative arc is gentle and lacks sharp turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s standout strength; details like "crust still whispers sesame" and "koi tiles are more powder than color" create a tactile, vivid setting that constrains and shapes the ritual. The environment feels lived-in and specific, actively guiding the characters' guerrilla gardening choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conflict is largely internal and thematic; while Maro’s confession introduces friction, the external threat ("officials who smell smoke") appears late and feels slightly tacked on to generate ending tension. The stakes remain somewhat abstract (memory vs. erasure) without forcing a decisive, high-cost trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but delivered through heavy-handed thesis statements ("What I seek is not redemption, but a place where action and attention stay married") rather than emerging solely from the subtext. The explicit repetition of the motivation creates a didactic tone that flattens the emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, successfully maintaining a reverent tone throughout the ritual. However, the integration of required phrases creates occasional awkwardness that disrupts the otherwise smooth rhythmic control of the first-person perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally lush and evocative ("braided the street," "flags of patience"), but suffers from visible seams where prompt elements are inserted verbatim (e.g., "bread from vanished bakery" missing a determiner). Additionally, some metaphors feel slightly decorative or strained, reducing the density of the line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of guerrilla gardening with a sacred tea ceremony offers a fresh, specific angle on the theme of urban resistance. The ritualistic approach provides a unique lens on the "creeping normality" concept, elevating it beyond a standard dystopian complaint.</comment>
