<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rowan is a distinct, consistent focalizer whose internal landscape matches the story’s lyrical tone. His motivation ("to discover the shape of intentions") drives the action, though the lack of visceral personal risk or deep internal conflict limits the character's dramatic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ritualistic structure creates a clear situational arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Causality follows the established magical logic effectively, though the episodic nature of the conflict (correcting a single ghost) keeps narrative propulsion modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, creating a cohesive, immersive world ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo"). The setting actively constrains the magic system, though occasional sensory abstractions ("dew were made of old silk") strain visualization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent but low-stakes; the conflict belongs primarily to the ghost, with Rowan acting as a safe mediator. While the resolution is earned through procedure, the absence of direct opposition or significant personal cost to Rowan limits tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central theme of "softening" intentions is resonant, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("Velveteen gloom suits certain truths...") to state the thesis. This overt summation undercuts the power of the subtext established by the chess game.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent fable-like register that suits the magical realism. The POV remains firmly anchored in Rowan’s perception, filtering the world through his specific, gentle expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is textured and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally obscures meaning ("thunderhead of chess moves"). Some images clash semantically ("blithe as a bell in fog"—bells in fog usually signal danger, not carefreeness), reducing precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of specific elements—weaving, chess, and the silo observatory—creates a fresh, distinct tableau. While the "caretaker of the dead" trope is familiar, the specific mechanism of decoding intentions via tapestry threads feels inventive.</comment>
