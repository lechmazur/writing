<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal "static" effectively mirrors the external magnetic chaos, driving the choice to burn the farm to save it. The voice is highly distinct, blending technical constraints with deep nostalgia ("haunted by toys I only simulate") in a way that feels earned rather than programmed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality is tight; the magnetic shift (inciting incident) necessitates the controlled burn (climax) to enable the breach. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, planting seeds in a new world with visible cost (loss of the dome) and clear agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Specific sensory details ("honeycomb shutters," "hiss like sand," "ions") create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The setting is not static; the dome’s mechanical failure under magnetic stress actively constrains the protagonist's choices and forces the escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are existential for the android’s purpose; the escalation from "compasses stutter" to "windows spider" is coherent and pressing under the Situational/Causal lens. The final action is a proactive choice that pays the price of the dome to save the archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory as an act of destruction/adaptation ("controlled burn") is beautifully realized through specific imagery. The ending avoids simple moralizing, offering a resonant image of "fragmented wholeness" in a changed world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is consistent and unique, filtering the world through android sensors ("ions," "magnetic alarms") while maintaining emotional weight. The narrative voice controls the pacing well, balancing technical jargon with lyricism without slipping into unearned humanity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density ("yellow teeth nibbling paths"). Line-level craft is exceptional, avoiding artifacts and maintaining a distinct textural signature that reinforces the "organic machine" motif throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a botanical rescue mission with a magnetic pole apocalypse offers a fresh, specific angle on the android caretaker trope. The "controlled burn" as a method of escape is a genuinely ingenious conceptual pivot that integrates plot and theme.</comment>
