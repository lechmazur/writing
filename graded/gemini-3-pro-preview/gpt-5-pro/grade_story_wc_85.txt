<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s guilt is embodied and drives the narrative, with the revelation of his own paternity effectively deepening the arc. However, the connection to his own history relies heavily on a fortuitous discovery rather than active pursuit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The watch hand fitting perfectly into a driftwood groove acts as a convenient puzzle-mechanic resolution to the mystery, bypassing causal struggle. While the closure is emotionally resonant, the mechanics of the discovery strain plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The driftwood archive and the "forgotten shore" are vivid, integral elements that act as both setting and tool, constraining the investigation. The final image of the cobalt terrace charges the resolution with specific atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Internal pressure is high, driven by the protagonist's need to atone. The external stakes are less active until the retrospective realization of his own sale, but the final choice to speak effectively tightens the narrative focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The thematic shift from manufacturing lies to stating facts offers a resonant conceptual repricing of the protagonist's trade. The "map of the shore and the facts" serves as a clean, non-moralizing answer to the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively blending noir and fable elements. Occasionally, the prose drifts into overwrought metaphor ("amputated three children"), but the perceptual signature remains strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high and imagery like the "brined alphabet" is exceptional. The repetition of the phrase "sieved hush" feels slightly mechanical, but the rhythm and sentence variety generally support the story’s momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a black market genealogist using a driftwood archive is inventive, synthesizing memory and landscape into a fresh narrative frame. The synthesis of professional guilt with a magical-realist setting feels original.</comment>
