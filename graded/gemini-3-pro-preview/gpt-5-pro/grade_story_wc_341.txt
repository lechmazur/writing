<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal logic is seamlessly constructed, merging professional discipline with profound grief to create a unique worldview. The choice to treat absence as a physical structure is earned by the established "theorem" of the character's mind. The breakdown of scientific objectivity into desperate, magical thinking is portrayed with distinct, embodied interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative operates under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens that successfully transitions into a Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The final act—tying a knot to the "cylinder of absence"—reconfigures the story's reality with a legible cost to the narrator's grip on sanity. The logic of the "negative monument" holds together the surreal cause-and-effect without breaking the spell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the action; the "negative monument" of the fall becomes a tangible part of the geography that constrains the narrator's choices. The specific atmospheric details ("dusty starlight," "lanternfish" lights) are filtered strictly through the meteorologist's POV. The environment actively participates in the resolution by "consenting" to be measured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stakes are psychological yet externalized through the stability of the gondola. The escalation moves from observation to interaction (tracing the wake) to the decisive action of tying the knot. While the conflict is internal, the physical manifestation of the balloon's instability provides sufficient pressure to drive the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The exploration of grief through meteorology is poignant and rich. However, the explicit statement near the end ("proved that the sky is a loom and absence is yarn") articulates the subtext too directly, acting as a Thematic Echo that slightly deflates the tension. The final image recovers the resonance, but that moment of summarization caps the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is exceptional, maintaining a "scientific-poetic" register that feels entirely native to this specific character. The control of psychic distance is precise, zooming in on the "graphite line" and out to the "patient archive" of the atmosphere without jarring shifts. The perception is consistently colored by the narrator's obsession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density in lines like "tether kissed an edge of wind." The rhythm supports the floating, dreamlike quality of the narrative. There are no scaffold artifacts or loops; the imagery is functional and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—stabilizing a balloon by tying it to the vacuum left by a falling body—is a startlingly original synthesis of physics and grief. The execution avoids standard tropes of loss by committing fully to the surreal logic of the "negative monument."</comment>
