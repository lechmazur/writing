<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as an archetypal vessel for poetic observation rather than a distinct agent under pressure; the pivotal choice regarding the pearl is recounted in summary without immediate, embodied struggle or visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative relies entirely on iterative summary ("Before dawn I enter") and flashback, failing to establish a specific, time-bound scene; the lack of a concrete "now" prevents legitimate dramatic escalation and violates the scope default.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric description is vivid ("serpentine grotto," "blue as distant ice"), though the reliance on abstract sensory metaphors ("wet nerve," "condensed hush") occasionally unmoors the physical reality of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The central conflict (keep vs. release) is resolved in hindsight via a convenient "middle path" that satisfies everyone; the absence of a dramatized test or genuine sacrifice renders the stakes theoretical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly preached ("quiet can travel farther than blaze") rather than emerging organically from the action; the ending offers a tidy moral summary instead of earned, resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical but maintains a high psychic distance; the elevated register ("glints move like syllables") feels performative, prioritizing poetic texture over character-specific interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overwriting frequently obscures clarity ("zephyr bloom of patience," "bright as sleep"); mixed metaphors ("wet nerve of the wall") and dense figurative language stall momentum and create an artificial texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept of tidal lanterns is imaginative, but the fable-like structure and lack of grounded, immediate conflict result in a safe narrative that leans on familiar tropes of "quiet wisdom."</comment>
