<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "skeptic" label is asserted but not dramatized; the narrator accepts the alien "magic" (dust resisting rain, inhaling libraries) without the resistance or testing that the trait implies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure effectively builds atmosphere, but the resolution relies on abstract "data" (the ratio) rather than causal consequence, making the closure feel conceptually imposed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like "resin," "pepper of soil," and "rainwashed stones" create a vivid, immersive texture that successfully grounds the abstract pilgrimage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative tension is low; the pilgrimage faces no significant obstacles or risks, and the "fear" mentioned is dismissed immediately, leaving the stakes purely intellectual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit statements ("Grief is also data," "Homecoming is an exchange constant") that summarize meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive and consistently lyrical, blending scientific and poetic registers ("salt math"), though it occasionally distances the reader from the character's humanity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich ("clouds combed the river"), but the density of metaphor occasionally slows momentum and veers into overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific inquiry and spiritual ritual offers a fresh, specific perspective on the First Contact genre, avoiding standard diplomatic tropes.</comment>
