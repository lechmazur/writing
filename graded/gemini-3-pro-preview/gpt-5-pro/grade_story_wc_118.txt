<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The historian functions effectively as a "sensor" for the story's dense imagery, fitting the lyric mode. However, the internal landscape is somewhat static; his specific oddity and interior friction are asserted ("sensitively perceptive") rather than fully dramatized through difficult choices or contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, building sensory pressure toward a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration where the historian's act of writing relieves the walls. The closure is quiet but earned, though the narrative arc relies more on observation than causal complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The silo library is realized with vivid, tactile specificity ("rolled ear," "grain dust falling like tiny rainstorms") that deeply grounds the abstract premise. The setting actively shapes the protagonist's method and the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are primarily conceptual—understanding the axis to let the walls rest—which fits the tone but lacks visceral urgency or high cost. The pressure is steady but low; the "displaced axis" threatens but doesn't actively oppose the protagonist's progress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is strong, effectively linking the physical tilt of the world to the metaphysical loss of dreams. The final image of the dragons as "instruments of measure" rather than monsters offers a satisfying, non-moralizing synthesis of the central concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently atmospheric, but the mandated phrase "sensitively perceptive" is inserted clumsily twice, disrupting the rhythm ("sensitively perceptive and odd"). The narrative distance is otherwise well-controlled and appropriate for the fable-like quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Imagery is often striking ("shelves were made of echoes"), but the prose suffers from repetitive artifacting. The phrase "bronze quiet" appears four times in a short space, shifting from motif to redundancy, and "sensitively perceptive" is redundant and clunky.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a silo library preserving acoustic memory after a planetary axis shift is fresh and evocative. The synthesis of agricultural decay and metaphysical crisis creates a distinct and memorable aesthetic.</comment>
