<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mei functions as a competent archetype rather than a fleshed-out character; she faces no internal doubt, contradiction, or genuine risk. Her ability to "orchestrate arrival" works instantly without friction, making her success feel like a foregone conclusion rather than an earned narrative victory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The central mechanism—pinpricks on a window projecting legible sentences across a harbor—strains physical credibility (optics) without sufficiently establishing a magic-realism frame. The narrative arc is linear and frictionless, leading to a "warm bath" closure where potential conflict dissolves into immediate agreement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmospheric details are vivid and establish a distinct mood ("oilskin smelling of gulls and rope"), though the "citrus memory" phrasing leans toward the abstract. The lighthouse is well-rendered as a space, grounding the fable-like tone effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretically present (secrets, bureaucracy) but never tested; the "wind nagged" is the only opposition, and the townspeople arrive compliantly. The lack of an antagonist or obstacle means there is no escalation, only a sequence of planned events.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "open secrets" is coherent but delivered didactically through exposition ("The message did not accuse; it changed the key") rather than emerging organically from action. The story explains its own subtext to the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout. However, it relies heavily on simile ("swung like a metronome," "rose like staff lines") which occasionally distances the reader from immediate sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished but suffers from metaphorical clutter ("glass cathedral," "citrus memory") that prioritizes poetic sounding-ness over precision. Several moments "tell" the emotional resonance ("room exhaled as if untying a tight knot") instead of showing it through interaction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "fortune cookie writer" and "lighthouse projector" is an inventive, fresh image. However, the emotional trajectory—a community instantly healing through a single shared moment—is a standard sentimental trope that lacks a fresh twist.</comment>
