<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is inextricably linked to his external actions; his refusal of "false comfort" is dramatized through the physical labor of the cairns and the projection. The shift from solitary discipline to collective "first citizen" is earned by his persistence, creating a resonant arc of leadership through service.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative structure is distinct and effective, using the bottle's transformation from a container to a lens as a pivotal causal mechanism that enables the climax. The closure is a quintessential Resonant Reconfiguration, where the arrival of others validates the alchemist's reality-building without resorting to the magic he rejected.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant in the plot; the tide erasing plans forces the use of working memory, and the "fossil light" of the bottle creates the blueprint for the city. The projection of the grid onto the cliff face is a brilliant synthesis of setting and character action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conflict between the ease of wishes and the rigor of effort is palpable and escalates from internal resistance to external construction. The arrival of the women is not a coincidence but a direct causal result of the projected light, resolving the isolation stake with a shared burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "effort as the real magic" is woven into every beat, subverting the fantasy tropes of alchemy and wishes. The specific naming of streets (Measure, Temper) and the "Tone: None" rule deepen the thematic argument without devolving into preachy abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is authoritative and textured, perfectly balancing the lyrical description of the setting with the stoic restraint of the protagonist. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing us to feel the "shivering world" through the alchemist's disciplined perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high-impact imagery like "salt gathered into stillness" and "patient oval of fossil light." A few metaphors ("scattered lungs," "weather's lip") lean slightly abstract, but the overall rhythm and precision are publication-ready.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "post-wish" premise is a genuinely fresh take on fantasy, repurposing a magical object (the bottle) as a tool for mundane engineering. The recontextualization of a ghost town revival as a literal reconstruction of reality is ingenious.</comment>
