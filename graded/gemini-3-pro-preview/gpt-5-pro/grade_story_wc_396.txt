<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrator is distinct, with a voice that blends professional detachment and poetic introspection ("shadow-laced peacekeeper"). However, the envoys transition from hostility to cooperation too rapidly, driven more by the magical prop than by interpersonal friction or the narrator's specific agency. The "cut thumb" moment offers a glimpse of internal struggle, but the protagonist ultimately functions more as a facilitator than a character forced into a difficult dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The two-shard structure (repairing the object, then using it) effectively bridges the backstory and the climax. The transition is legible, and the closure lands with a concrete "Decisive Change" as the envoys commit to specific resource costs (sleds, cellars). While the resolution relies heavily on the magical object, the logic is established early, preventing a feeling of unearned convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, contrasting the organic "ripening fruit" of the orchard with the sterile, shifting violence of the ice floes. Specific details like "sap on my gloves" and the "shuttered vintage store" ground the magical realism in tactile experience. The environment actively pressures the characters, with the ice's movement serving as a ticking clock for the mediation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (war, survival), and the pressure of the "next break" drives the narrative forward. However, the conflict resolution is softened by the globe’s power; the device does the heavy lifting of persuasion, reducing the need for the protagonist to navigate complex human resistance. The climax regains ground by demanding a "cost" from the envoys, ensuring the peace isn't free.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of empathy as a "map onto action" rather than a passive feeling is rigorously developed and delivered with clarity. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, recontextualizing neutrality not as absence but as "balance" taught like a ladder. The thematic argument coheres well with the plot mechanics without becoming overly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and controlled, fitting the "peacekeeper" persona well. The shift between the lyrical description of the ice and the practical dialogue of the negotiation is handled smoothly. While the register is elevated, it remains grounded in the narrator's specific worldview and task.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and image-rich, with strong phrasing like "gathered ridicule like tinder" and "rehearsed its slow departure." A few moments verge on purple ("shadow-laced," "histories that disliked daylight"), creating a slight scaffold of abstraction. Generally, the line-level craft supports the magical realist tone effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of a lighthouse orchard and an ice-floe war offers a fresh visual landscape. While the "magical object resolving conflict" is a familiar trope, the specific execution involving vintage mirrors and the reconstruction of the shard feels inventive. The story synthesizes the prompt elements into a cohesive, organic whole.</comment>
