<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between fear and professional competence is compelling, and agency is high in the climax. However, the leap in capability—from stunt performer to cryptographer decoding a child's cast—strains credibility and feels unearned by established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a clear turning point, but the inciting causal chain relies on dream logic that breaks the thriller frame. Finding a specific cast in a bin that decrypts via a seashell to a specific library book is a contrivance that undermines the plot's solidity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and mechanically integrated into the climax; the "rotten boards" and "ceiling projector" turn the environment into a tactical asset. The sensory details ("iron and old glue") effectively ground the surreal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation is distinct, moving from discovery to a physical trap that forces a confrontation. While the antagonist falling into a pre-set floor trap is slightly convenient, the protagonist's preparation ("chalked the steps") earns the victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming identity from a "composite" existence is coherent and drives the ending. However, the execution leans on explicit statements ("vulnerability is power," "paperwork silence") rather than subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent "noir poet" register throughout. While the stylization is heavy, the POV remains stable and the internal rhythm reinforces the character's trembling intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose suffers from metaphor density that slows momentum; phrases like "pages flaking like scabs," "ribs stopped counting exits," and "paperwork silence" clutter the line level. The relentless figurative language obscures clarity in favor of mood.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of stunt work, noir tropes, and a surreal library setting offers a fresh aesthetic. However, the plot relies on a standard revenge structure and the "magical clue" device detracts from the grounded premise.</comment>
