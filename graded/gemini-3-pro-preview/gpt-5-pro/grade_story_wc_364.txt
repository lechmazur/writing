<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the costs paid (surname, laughter) are specific and poignant. However, the "meek" label is told rather than shown, as their actions display confident mastery and bravery throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain of repairs accumulating toward stability, supported by the specific magic system. While the resolution is distinct, the final and most costly repair (trading childhood laughter) is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the climax's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, integrating synesthetic details ("stone liked songs") that actively constrain the protagonist's methods. The physics of the world—gravity, sound, and stone memory—feels cohesive and fresh.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate effectively from physical repair to the sacrifice of identity (surname). The tremor adds necessary physical pressure, though the highest cost (laughter) is paid in a summary beat, reducing the visceral weight of the final trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of maintenance requiring personal sacrifice is resonant and well-developed through the bartering mechanic. The final paragraph leans into explicit moralizing ("Truth is..."), which explains the theme rather than letting the imagery linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and fable-like, fitting the soft sci-fi tone perfectly. At times, the poetic register risks flattening the urgency (e.g., comparing gears to turtles), but the control over the protagonist's perspective remains strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm and imagery, but suffers from a capitalization artifact ("Deliberate in breathing") that signals a forced prompt insertion. High metaphor density in action beats occasionally slows the pacing and obscures immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mechanical repair with emotional bartering is highly original and engaging. The concept of "waking" stone with sound and memory offers a fresh take on magical maintenance.</comment>
