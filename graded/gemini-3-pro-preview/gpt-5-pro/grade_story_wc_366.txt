<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's "reticence" is beautifully dramatized in the kitchen scene ("shape of silence"), validating the trait beyond mere assertion. However, explicit self-diagnosis ("I was not brave," "I am reticent") slightly flattens the characterization into label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the creation of the "unburning lantern," a distinct and costly image. The drive lens shifts smoothly from Accumulative to Situational as the final run forces a specific, irreversible act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "pear and salt" and the specific mechanics of the lantern room are excellent. The setting actively constrains the final image, with the moonlight through the panes and glass becoming the "light."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pressure of impending automation forces a tangible, symbolic response (the jar ritual). While the external opposition is minimal, the internal pressure to preserve the "ache" creates sufficient stakes for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but marred by over-explanation in the final paragraphs ("This is what... had taught me"), which converts subtext into an explicit thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the "warmly observant" persona. It maintains a distinct texture, though it occasionally prioritizes poetic cadence over immediate clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from high metaphor density in the climax ("cursive," "teeth," "rookery," "daring"), creating a "purple" effect that distracts from the physical action of the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The specific ritual of the oil, letters, and sea glass offers a fresh, tactile angle on the familiar "end of the lighthouse" trope. The synthesis of elements feels organic.</comment>
