<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is rich and sensory, fitting the premise perfectly. However, the character is extremely stable ("steady as banked coals") from the start, navigating the crisis with high competence and minimal internal hesitation, which lowers dramatic tension in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Lyric drive, moving effectively from entry to dowsing to the encounter and finally to the stillpoint. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the map is internalized ("made in him") and the tool re-calibrated to "poise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "ultrasonic forest" is realized with vivid, synesthetic specificity ("syllables of sap," "deer made of echoes"). The setting actively constrains and shapes the protagonist's navigation methods, functioning as an antagonist and resource simultaneously.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and escalates through sensory intensity and the memory of grief ("You left"). However, the resolution of the conflict—reaching out to the warning which soaks in "like warmth"—feels somewhat frictionless; the victory comes from endurance rather than a costly, difficult choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of mapping internal emotional landscapes is poignant and coherent. It wavers slightly into didacticism with explicit lines like "navigate uncharted emotional depths without drowning," telling the reader the metaphor rather than letting the subtext do the heavy lifting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and highly controlled, maintaining the "blind/auditory" filter without slipping into visual shortcuts. The consistent lyrical texture unifies the fabulist elements successfully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the prose is polished, it suffers from "simile drift," relying heavily on "like X" constructions (8+ instances, e.g., "like fog," "like a small moon," "like a path of dew"). The figurative density borders on purple ("tasted its grammar"), occasionally obscuring the action with poetic scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of dowsing for sound and mapping via vibration is a fresh synthesis of fantasy and cartography tropes. The execution is imaginative, transforming standard "inner journey" beats into specific sensory actions.</comment>
