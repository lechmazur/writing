<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal arc—from a guilt-ridden strategist to a healer—is perfectly mapped onto the external action. The conflict is embodied in specific physical cues (the fidgeting, the knot-tying), and the decision to "draw the game" rather than win is a profound, earned character turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative creates a seamless Causal/Situational hybrid where the physical repair of the village mirrors the protagonist's psychological repair. Closure is distinct and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration); the cost is paid in the surrender of the pawn and the acceptance of the "tug" on the wrist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is exceptional, particularly the image of "snow hung midair like a held breath" and the "baker's eyelid hung midblink." The setting actively constrains the narrative, forcing the protagonist to engage with the "woven hush" rather than just observe it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly braided: the village's stasis and the tutor's lingering guilt. The escalation from fixing small errors (baker, child) to the central "unbearable" choice regarding the prince ensures the climax feels earned and proportional to the setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness as a strategic "draw" rather than a victory is intellectually satisfying and emotionally resonant. The story resists a tidy moral, instead offering a complex reconfiguration of the tutor's worldview: competence can heal as well as harm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and highly controlled, blending the lexicon of chess ("gambit," "pivot," "endgame") with a fable-like lyrical register. The narrator’s perspective filters every detail through his specific professional trauma.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("platinum shone like a moon pared down to its hardest clause"). Rhythm is well-managed, using the "metronome" of the thunder to pace the surgery. A few metaphors are slightly abstract, but they serve the magical realism well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chess allegory with a "sleeping beauty" style stasis is fresh and handled with sophistication. The "medical" approach to breaking the curse via the tapestry adds a tactile, original layer to the resolution.</comment>
