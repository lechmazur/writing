<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator is distinct and introspective, with a clear internal struggle between the virus’s compulsion and the desire for safety. However, the voice conflicts with the self-description; the protagonist claims to be "rational" and suspicious of charms, yet narrates in lush, heavy metaphors ("tide chart drawn by a poet," "rational as rainfall").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving from the setup of the trial to a decisive renunciation at the climax. The closure (hiding the eye to rely on "fractured grace") is a meaningful Resonant Reconfiguration. The courier's reappearance functions as a plot device to force the choice, though the lack of confrontation with them softens the external stakes slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "hanging orchard" is a vivid, precarious environment that effectively mirrors the fragility of the social experiment. The integration of the setting into the action—hiding the eye beneath the truffle bed—grounds the resolution in physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The internal conflict (truth vs. safety) is palpable and drives the central experiment. The external pressure from the courier is present but resolved somewhat conveniently (hiding the object off-stage/unopposed), which lowers the felt cost of the antagonist, though the cost of losing the eye's aid is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thematic synthesis of composting/mycelium with processing harsh truths is resonant and organic. The ending reframes the central problem—living with the virus without artificial aids—successfully without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent in its lyricism and creates a strong mood. However, the "rational" filtering creates a slight disconnect; the narration feels more like a poet's than a scientist's, even one whose "caution bared itself."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm but suffers from metaphorical density and occasional mixed imagery ("soil still reasoned," "rational as rainfall"). The high volume of figurative language in a short space slightly dampens the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The combination of the empathy virus trope with the specific, earthy profession of truffle foraging and the hanging orchard setting feels fresh. The solution—using the earth to metabolize the "shine" of the eye—is a unique, non-obvious turn.</comment>
