<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, and the "counting heartbeats" trait is well-integrated as a coping mechanism. However, motivation is often delivered via exposition ("I tell it why I have climbed back up... to ask for something more") rather than emerging solely through friction and choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The closure is legible, but the resolution relies heavily on the supernatural entity providing the solution (the ink map/corridor) rather than protagonist agency. The "corridor of air" removes the physical stakes of the descent, softening the causal cost of the decision to leave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and specific ("opal observatory," "porcelain shard"), grounding the surreal elements effectively. The sensory details ("whale note," "breath fogging") create a strong sense of place, though occasionally the description verges on ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal pressure is sustained through the fear of the cold and the erased identity. However, the external escalation is mitigated by the ghost's assistance, which turns the dangerous trek into a "path where wind drops," reducing the felt cost of the final action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but articulated too explicitly in the text ("I do not want revenge; I want a wiser ending"). This direct stating of the thesis reduces subtextual resonance and feels like a summary of intent rather than an earned realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "hushed" tone appropriate for the setting. The poetic register is controlled, though it occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is density-rich but suffers from metaphor overcrowding ("pearl on the tongue," "shadow stitched from clerks," "metronome for mercy"). This heavy figuration sometimes obscures the literal action and creates a barrier to immediacy, reading as overwritten in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a "death certificate error survivor" seeking to correct the cosmic record is fresh and compelling. The synthesis of bureaucratic erasure with spectral radio interference creates a unique and memorable narrative frame.</comment>
