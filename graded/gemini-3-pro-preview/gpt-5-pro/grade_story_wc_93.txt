<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator is distinct, driven by a compelling blend of mathematical obsession and romantic longing. The internal conflict between the "sliding futures" and the desperate need to anchor the present via promise is vivid and well-rendered. While the "her" remains somewhat archetypal, the protagonist's specific interiority ("hum the numbers until they taste like salt") grounds the surreal premise in genuine need.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent ritualistic logic where the accumulation of pattern and intent forces a change in the world's physics. The closure—gravity obeying the promise—lands with earned conceptual weight, effectively reconfiguring the "frictionless" problem. The logic of the magic system is consistent, though the middle section slightly loops on the description of the method before advancing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the "frictionless" environment is not just scenery but a profound constraint that dictates movement (eel skins, math-based traction). The sensory details are precise and imaginative, merging the mathematical with the elemental. The environment actively pressures every beat of the protagonist's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are existential (dissolution of the shore) but anchored effectively in a personal promise. The escalation is linear but tense, moving from preparation to the perilous walk, then to the final confrontation with entropy at the cliff's edge. The "sliding futures" provide a constant, situational pressure that raises the cost of every step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "promise as physics"—that intent can bind matter when laws fail—is executed with high resonance. The story avoids preachy moralizing, instead letting the "weight" of the dust and the stability of the shore demonstrate the thesis. The final image elegantly resolves the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is authoritative, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "mythic" tone that suits the slipstream genre. The specialized vocabulary (primes, Fibonacci, driftbone) reinforces the character's worldview. The shift to "we" at the climax feels earned by the ritual's completion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The imagery is dense and evocative ("thin as breath," "fragile logic"), but the sentence structure suffers from repetitive subject-opener patterns ("I am," "I place," "I hum," "I scoop"). While this cadence supports the ritualistic tone, the syntactic monotony drags on the narrative momentum in the middle third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of elements. The transformation of "eel herding" into a metaphysical defense against entropy via prime numbers is fresh and striking. The concept of "borrowed dawn" and "friction fleeing" creates a unique speculative space that feels entirely new.</comment>
