<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrator’s voice perfectly synthesizes the required "amoral philanthropist" persona with the "secretly sentimental" internal drive. The conflict between these two poles is not just stated but dramatized in the final choice: a calculated compromise that preserves the bird but refuses the "drastic thing" (fixing the drought). The decision feels inextricably linked to this specific character's worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causality is tight, governed by the environmental constraints of the "manufactured drought" and the acoustic timing of the thunder. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "narrower grace" is a distinct, costly outcome that reweights the stakes (survival vs. redemption) without providing a tidy solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the acoustic properties of the salt flat and the "throat of stone" dictate the plot's timing and the protagonist's tactics. Sensory details like the "shy thermal sigh" and the "sky taut like glass" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that serves the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The external pressure (the directors/market) and the physical constraint (the thunder) create a clear crucible for the hatching. The escalation is internal but potent: the temptation to "break contracts" and release the water offers a genuine alternative path, making the final refusal a high-stakes character beat with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "compromise as an ugly saint" lands with sophistication, avoiding simple moralizing about the environment. The story explores the friction between commercial utility and genuine memory, resolving in a nuanced stance that feels earned through the specific imagery of the echo and the ledger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, authoritative, and suitably elevated for a character who "endows what the market tolerates." The shift from cold calculation to the intimacy of the hatching ("tremor that said I belonged to it") is handled with excellent control of narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high-quality imagery ("careful as contrition," "thunder muttered like an old judge"). The phrasing supports the tone without becoming decorative; lines like "names are only half-truths" deepen the texture efficiently. No scaffolding artifacts or loops detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of de-extinction, acoustic engineering, and cynical corporate drought management creates a fresh, distinct premise. The refusal to embrace a standard redemption arc—choosing instead a "bent, costly mercy"—subverts expectations meaningfully.</comment>
