<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator's internal arc from rigid controller to steward is compelling and clearly charted through the "itch" of certainty and the eventual "prayer" of the plan. Theo serves as an effective, if slightly functional, foil who prompts the protagonist's introspection without overshadowing the central consciousness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies on a poetic assertion that defies physical plausibility: moss "stitching" wood to hold a trellis together against a gale is structurally unsound in a realist frame. This resolves the physical stakes through lyrical metaphor rather than causal logic, weakening the closure's verisimilitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, anchoring the lyrical voice in the "wet limestone," "damp rib cage," and "fern spores." The nursery feels lived-in and tactile, with the linden leaf acting as a potent micro-setting that constrains attention and guides the shift in perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict between the narrator's need for order and the storm's chaos escalates clearly, with a felt cost in the "wince" and the admission of losses. The shift in tactics—reconstructing beds based on water flow rather than rulers—demonstrates meaningful agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the thematic exploration of stewardship is rich, the ending explicitly moralizes the lesson ("If anyone asks... I will say..."), summarizing the thesis rather than letting the final image resonate on its own. This explicit statement of meaning in the final paragraph significantly reduces thematic subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and consistently maintained, blending technical nursery knowledge with a contemplative, lyrical register. The narrator's perspective filters every detail—from the ledger to the leaf—through a cohesive, character-specific worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery like the "coffee ring like a compass." At times, the density of metaphor risks becoming overwrought ("ledger lined up like seed flats in a pivoted sun"), but the line-level craft remains disciplined and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of plant behavior with a philosophy of surrender offers a fresh, specific take on the "man vs. nature" trope. While the "lesson from nature" core is familiar, the specific execution through nursery mechanics and the linden leaf adds genuine texture and novelty.</comment>
