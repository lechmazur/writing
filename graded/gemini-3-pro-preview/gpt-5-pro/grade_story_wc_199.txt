<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fen’s internal landscape is rich ("careful barns of feeling"), and his motivation is clear. The pivot from a lifetime of hoarding to releasing is a strong Decisive Change with visible cost, though the internal resistance to destroying his life's work folds slightly too quickly given his established nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Structurally sound with a clear Causal drive; the inciting object directly enables the climax. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change (releasing the seeds) that logically results in the arbor rising, satisfying the established stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "Ashen skyborne arbor" is a vivid, integrated setting that acts as both a character and a constraint. Sensory details like "palms greened" and "ash and candy" ground the fantastical elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High stakes (the risk to the villages) are established early and effectively pressure the climax. The conflict is tight, pitting the protagonist's ingrained identity (sorter) against the urgent necessity of the moment (scatter).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of relinquishing control resonates well through action, but the explicit articulation of the thesis ("aware that order was a question and listening the only honorable answer") near the end undercuts the subtext, triggering a slight penalty for thematic echoing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic fable tone ("husk, habit, and hope"). The integration of complex prompt phrases is generally smooth, though the repetition of the full object name slightly drags on the rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density ("mulch of memory," "braided in one wind"). While the required phrases sometimes feel slightly grafted, the surrounding sentence craft supports them with strong imagery and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of a seed sorter on a flying wooden whale reading leaf-grammar via monuments is highly original and imaginatively executed. The synthesis of setting and mechanic feels fresh and specific.</comment>
