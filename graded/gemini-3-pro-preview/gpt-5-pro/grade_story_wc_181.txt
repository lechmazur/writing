<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear agency by repurposing the cameo, prioritizing attention over ego. This choice forecloses the "future face" inheritance, satisfying the cost requirement. The "bathroom breakthrough" quirk serves as a functional, if slightly convenient, character trait that structures the decision process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "third road" resolves the linear debt crisis with a conceptual cost (the loss of the self-portrait). The logic follows a consistent dream-like causality, anchored effectively by the bathroom interludes which provide necessary pacing breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the lyrical astral orchard ("petals edited the air") with the gritty station bathroom ("pump noise," "hairline of frost") creates a vivid, grounded reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist (prohibition on touching flowers) and shapes the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as a tension between linear debt and a "gentler grammar." The escalation—facing the ancestor's ledger—pressures the protagonist into the pivotal choice. The cost is conceptual but legible: the sacrifice of the defined self (the face cameo) for a communal map.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "nonlinear inheritance" is handled with sophistication, moving beyond a prompt keyword into a genuine exploration of ancestry and memory. The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a lingering image of seeds and mirrors that reinforces the cyclical theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a "bewildered curator" persona that balances awe with professional inventory. While some phrasing leans toward the ornamental ("brightened disquiet humming"), the overall consistency and control of tone are strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("stones... glowed like sleepy moons"). A few metaphors feel slightly precious ("edited the air"), but the rhythm is controlled. No significant artifacts or loops interrupt the flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi museum curator with magical realism elements creates a fresh narrative space. The subversion of the portrait trope—capturing breath/context instead of the face—feels inventive and specifically tailored to the story's logic.</comment>
