<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is distinct and drives the fable-like narrative effectively. The fisherman’s shift from skepticism to alliance is grounded in the grandmother backstory ("hum to the nets"), though his conversion feels slightly frictionless given the stakes. The dynamic is cooperative rather than high-pressure, which fits the tone but limits the "crucible" effect on character revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative to Situational arc, moving from decoding to instruction. The closure functions as a valid Charged Poise, where the tools for the future conflict (the council) are assembled and the "weapon" (the language) is transferred. The logic of the magic system is consistent, and the ending reconfigures the rope from refuse to evidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout strength, blending the tactile (tar, hemp, fulgurite) with the ethereal effectively. The specific mechanics of the magic system—using glass to hear heat in rope—act as a micro-setting that constrains the action. The environment feels lived-in and inextricably linked to the plot's central mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (loss of ancient knowledge), and the council's threat adds necessary time pressure ("before the thaw"). However, the antagonist is off-screen, and the primary obstacle (decoding the rope) yields easily to the protagonist's competence. The conflict lacks a moment of visceral resistance or failure before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus efficiency is handled with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed morals in favor of a resonant transfer of stewardship. The seed and the knot language serve as potent, integrated symbols that carry the argument without needing abstract explanation. The final image of the rope as a "living sentence" lands well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately elevated for the fable/mythic mode. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining the "philosophical" detachments while engaging with the sensory details. The shift to a collective "school in session" focus at the end is earned by the preceding action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density in the descriptions of the knots. However, a few stock comparisons ("coiled like a sleeping serpent," "scattered like gulls") detract from the otherwise fresh imagery ("syllables of salt," "listening bone"). These clichés prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central conceit—listening to the heat/memory in ropes using fulgurite—is highly imaginative and distinct. It synthesizes agricultural and maritime elements into a fresh magic system. The execution honors this originality by making the decoding technical and specific rather than vague and hand-wavy.</comment>
