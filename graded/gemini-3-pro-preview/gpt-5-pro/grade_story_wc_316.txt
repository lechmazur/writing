<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kana's internal conflict is compelling, and the choice to "vivify" the witness demonstrates clear agency. However, interiority relies heavily on elaborate metaphor ("numbness was the quiet court") rather than visceral, embodied emotion, which distances the reader from the character's immediate physical experience. The "ego death" trait functions more as a backstory label than a behavior-shaping constraint in the present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative establishes a legal conflict but resolves it through dream logic; the verdict "arose without announcement" bypasses the present antagonists (the advocates) rather than confronting them causally. While the ritual resolution is poetic, the external stakes dissolve conveniently rather than through a decisive, logical victory or compromise. Closure is resonant emotionally but structurally soft regarding the "custody battle" premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is inventive, vivid, and essential to the narrative's logic; the "floating rock dojo" and "brain in a jar" are not just backdrop but active participants in the climax. The environment coheres perfectly with the surreal tone, and the final image of the dojo drifting lower grounds the resolution in the physical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled, braiding the internal battle against numbness with the external custody hearing. However, the external opposition (the city advocates) is silenced too easily by the Sensei's floor-strike and the ensuing kata, lacking a robust counter-move that would heighten the pressure before the resolution. The internal escalation is stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "complementary opposites" is masterfully woven into the plot mechanics, driving the resolution of both the legal and internal conflicts. The concept of the "seed" versus "direction" offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of identity and ownership, landing with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and stylistically consistent, blending legal terminology with mystic lyricism effectively. The shift to a collective experience ("We brought salt...") is handled smoothly without violating the single-POV constraint, reinforcing the theme of connection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically strong and highly polished, with striking imagery ("shear silk from stone"). However, the density of figurative language is relentless ("tidal alphabet," "sipped polarity"), occasionally obscuring the physical action and creating a layer of abstraction that competes with narrative clarity in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of sci-fi, legal drama, and wuxia elements, creating a fresh and memorable world. The central conceit—a brain in a jar acting as a witness in its own clone custody hearing—is ingenious and executed with artistic integrity.</comment>
