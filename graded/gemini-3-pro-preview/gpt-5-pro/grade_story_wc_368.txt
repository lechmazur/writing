<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle with the "borrowed thunder" of the donor heart is compellingly embodied, creating a strong emotional arc that resolves in a shift from "patient" to "harbor." The dye master serves as an effective catalyst, challenging the protagonist's worldview with specific, grounded actions rather than just abstract advice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A flawless structural execution for this scope; the narrative moves efficiently through observation, experiment (the wing), and instruction to a resonant closure. The ending achieves a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist's stance toward the donor heart is fundamentally altered with visible conceptual cost (surrendering control to become a "lens").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the "sun trails" and "floating rock" mechanics directly enable the dye master's method and the story's central lesson. The environment constrains the action and charges the final imagery, meeting the highest standard for integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but palpable, escalated by the dye master's gentle but firm dismantling of the protagonist's initial "lantern" approach. The tension between the "loud" new rhythm of the heart and the need for "iridescent caution" provides a clear, coherent pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "lens vs. lantern"—receptivity versus imposition—is profound and tightly woven into the physical action of the story (the wing, the mirror). The final insight feels earned through the scene's specifics rather than imposed as a moral, offering a resonant answer to the inciting question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, maintaining a consistent "valley-mist" atmosphere that suits the surreal setting. The shift in internal monologue from anxious questioning to settled observation mirrors the narrative arc perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("tasted of stone and noon"), though occasionally tautological ("valley" repeated in "air above the valley held a valley-mist wonder") or slightly repetitive with verbs ("drag of wind," "light dragged"). These minor artifacts do not obscure meaning but slightly mar the otherwise high polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of medical trauma (donor heart) with a metaphysical, high-fantasy tea house offers a genuinely fresh perspective on the "healing" narrative. The concept of "magnetizing stories" through physical physics (angles/light) is inventive and well-executed.</comment>
