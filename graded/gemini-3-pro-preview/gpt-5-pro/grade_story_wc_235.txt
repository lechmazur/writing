<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator is a distinct, lyrical presence whose internal landscape effectively mirrors the external setting. The "past selves" (surveyor, lover, child) are sketched with remarkable economy, serving as distinct active forces that drive the climax rather than mere furniture. While the "jealousy" motivation is slightly abstract until the dream sequence, the interrogation of these selves provides a satisfying, character-driven resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from a haunting inciting image (the grave) to a lucid dream confrontation and a resonant waking integration. Closure is exemplary: the act of editing the grave’s silence ("let the mouth keep eating the stone") is a Conceptual Repricing that earns its weight. The transitions between waking and dreaming are seamless, anchored by the consistent "chronicler" logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, from the "creosote and spruce" to the "rings... a calendar that never learned digits." The environment actively participates in the narrative, with the mountain "speaking through rafters" and the wind pacing like a patient. The birch bark scroll serves as a perfect micro-setting that constrains the final act of creation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conflict between the desire for narrative order and the chaos of mortality (the grave) is well-dramatized. Escalation occurs internally through the "interrogation" of jealousy, tightening until the specific verbs are extracted from the past selves. The cost is subtle but felt—the "knuckles creaking" and the acceptance of a life that must be constantly rewritten to stave off silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story explores the intersection of memory, narrative, and mortality with profound maturity. The resolution—that stories do not end but "lean harder on whoever keeps the ledger"—avoids platitude, offering a hard-won insight grounded in the story's specific imagery. The theme emerges organically from the action of the chronicler rather than through tacked-on exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently high-register, maintaining a "lucid dream chronicler" persona that justifies the density of the prose. The shift to the distinct imperatives of the past selves ("stake nothing," "scent every page," "play") provides excellent textural contrast. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing for both the panoramic "soaring" perspective and intimate tactile details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, though it occasionally suffers from metaphor density that threatens to stall momentum (e.g., "titles feel like paper boats," "jealousy is a magnet," "memories are all bent nails"). While the images are individually strong, the relentless figurative language sometimes creates a "muddle" effect that distances the reader from the immediate action. A slight pruning would let the best images shine brighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a lucid dreamer consulting past selves to "edit" their own grave is fresh and executed with high conceptual integrity. The synthesis of the rugged mountain setting with the surreal dream logic creates a unique atmosphere. The "ledger" metaphor for life/death provides a novel lens on a classic existential theme.</comment>
