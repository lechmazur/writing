<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's sensory interiority is vivid and distinct, grounding the surreal premise in concrete experience. However, the character feels somewhat deterministic ("They built me to be a bridge"), which muffles the sense of active personal struggle in the choice to release the voices. The motivation is clear, but the lack of internal resistance or contradictory impulses makes the final decision feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to a decisive closure (Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change) that effectively reweights the world. The reliance on the "cyclically spontaneous" trait to drive transitions ("my leaps come unbidden") introduces a slight passivity to the middle section, functioning as a convenient mechanism to advance the plot rather than causal agency. The ending lands with satisfying structural weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere and sensory specificity are exceptional; details like "mint and burned dust" and the "green glass shard" humming create a tangible, immersive world. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's investigation, with the physical attributes of the bay (vibration, rust, thermal tides) serving as the map itself. The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary interface for the story's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pressure is primarily thematic and atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the "pull" of the withheld truth provides a consistent, rising tension. While the stakes are high for the refugees, the personal cost to the protagonist is largely metaphorical ("gravity... bending my balance"), lacking a gritty, irrevocable trade-off on the page. The climax resolves through "attunement" and redirection, which feels elegant but slightly low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of truth as weight and the moral imperative to distribute it ("bridges do not hoard weight") is powerfully integrated into the action and imagery. The final image of the map redrawing itself as a channel rather than a route resonates deeply with the core concept. The story avoids preachy moralizing by grounding the insight in the mechanics of the protagonist's design.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and perfectly tuned to the "sensory map maker" persona. The synesthetic descriptions ("braid taste and color onto air") are controlled and purposeful, establishing a unique perceptual signature that never breaks character. The lyrical distance is maintained without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("shard hums like captive summer"). The figurative language is lush but functional within the established voice; occasional metaphors border on the abstract ("silence aches with mass") but fit the dream-logic tone. The technical execution is polished with no distracting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sensory mapper with parallel-universe archaeology is a fresh, compelling angle on the "found footage/log" trope. The execution transforms familiar sci-fi elements (abandoned spaceport, refugees) into something poetic and strange. The perspective feels memorable and distinct.</comment>
