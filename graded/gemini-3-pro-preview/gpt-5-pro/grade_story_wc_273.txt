<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from a seeker refusing a lie to a teacher confirming a hard truth is compelling. The specific "tracker" perception filters the world effectively, though the "albino" trait functions primarily as imagery rather than a plot constraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear procedural arc (theory, experiment, confirmation, resolution) that supports the conceptual epiphany. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the protagonist's purpose, grounded in the confirmed limitation of the "widened second."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is active and tactile; the wind functions as a tool that shapes the ink, integrating environment with plot. The "wind-carved bones of tents" and "bronze and opal-eyed" drone create a distinct, atmospheric blend of the archaic and the technological.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is internal and atmospheric, deepening as the protagonist enters the "widened second." While the external stakes are low—the experiment succeeds without hitch—the emotional confrontation with the sister’s death provides sufficient pressure and a felt cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central concept—that time dilation is a product of collective attention ("terror is a choir")—is interwoven beautifully with the narrative action. The conclusion ("train the young to be consciously wild") naturally extends this theme into a societal role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is highly distinct, characterized by a "perceptual signature" that blends measurement (microseconds, vectors) with lyricism. The consistent elevated tone matches the mythic-scientific subject matter without slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("clock coughing sand," "orchestra of halted crescendos"), successfully sustaining a high-literary tone. The rhythm is controlled, though the metaphor density pushes the limit of clarity in the opening paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of tribal setting, sci-fi technology (drones, attention metrics), and metaphysical time-tracking is striking and fresh. The interpretation of the "slow-motion crisis" trope as a manipulatable phenomenon of physics/attention is genuinely ingenious.</comment>
