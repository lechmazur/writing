<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrator's voice ("Old Partial") is distinct and consistent, effectively anchoring the fable-like tone. However, the protagonist's competence is undermined by the abstract leap of logic used to deduce the name "Mira" from missing freighter whistles, which feels like authorial insertion rather than character-driven problem solving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure relies on "dream logic" that strains plausibility in a realistic setting: specifically, the impossibility of seeing a small dried flower in a woman's hand on a passing ship at night from a lighthouse tower. Additionally, the deduction of a specific name from a ship's silence is opaque and lacks causal grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "opal dock" and "mist" are vivid and establish a strong mood. However, the spatial choreography at the climax fails; the visual connection between the lighthouse keeper and the passenger on the liner ignores distance and lighting constraints, breaking the physical reality of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The internal pressure to decode the message is sustained well, fitting the "witness" archetype. The stakes remain largely abstract and proxy-driven, lacking a direct personal cost to the narrator beyond the effort of the task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of connection through absence and the role of the witness ("lantern and harbor both") is excellent and resonates deeply in the final image. The resolution effectively reweights the concept of "borrowed memories" into a meaningful act of service.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical, slightly archaic voice is controlled and purposeful, suiting the story's melancholic tone. The narrative distance is managed well, maintaining the mystique of the narrator's perspective without slipping into confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally overwritten with high metaphor density ("breathe its tired white lung," "gaps are the letters"). The rhythm is strong, but some figurative language borders on purple, slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a lighthouse keeper interpreting gaps in the light is a fresh twist on a classic trope. The execution is hampered by the plausibility issues in the plot, but the core concept remains imaginative.</comment>
