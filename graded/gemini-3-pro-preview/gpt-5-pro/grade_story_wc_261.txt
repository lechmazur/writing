<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict—seeking closure versus the compulsion to open wounds—is articulated with precision and resolves in a distinct shift of stance (Earned Stasis). The motivation to "read the stories in scars" drives every choice, transforming the prompt's requirements into a cohesive psychological arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is excellent; the final Resonant Reconfiguration (the scar opening like a book) recontextualizes the premise with visible cost and thematic weight. The surreal causality of the "displaced miracle" is handled with confident logic, and the narrative drive holds firm under the lyric/hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the "roots of stone" and the "service tunnel" dictate the protagonist's movement and tactics. The environment mirrors the internal state effectively, though the density of sensory metaphor occasionally risks obscuring spatial geometry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is clear and largely internal, anchored by the physical cost of the descent ("pain salts the floor"). The stakes shift meaningfully from a desire for erasure to a willingness to engage with the wound, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic integration is masterful; the parallel between coffee rings, tree rings, and scars creates a unified argument that "reading is not tearing." The ending resists simple healing in favor of a complex, resonant acceptance of the wound's memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent surreal lyricism that fits the post-anesthesia state. The transition to accidental telepathy is handled with a "matter-of-fact" tone that sells the magical realism without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush and inventive ("sutures curve like a parenthesis"), though the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("pain salts the floor with stars") borders on saturation. The aesthetic beauty is high, but slightly more directness in the physical climax would sharpen the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A strikingly original synthesis of medical trauma and botanical magical realism. The concept of a "displaced miracle" sliding along roots is a fresh, non-obvious angle that transforms the prompt elements into a singular vision.</comment>
