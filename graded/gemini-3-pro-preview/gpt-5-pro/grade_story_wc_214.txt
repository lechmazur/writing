<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrator is distinct, but the internal landscape relies on diagnostic labels ("spiritually curious," "grief I could not lift") rather than embodied action. The salvage crew functions as props rather than characters, converting instantly from antagonists to allies without credible psychological resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The resolution relies on a "soft reset" where the salvage crew simply cancels a demolition order because of a beautiful moment; this lacks bureaucratic reality and earned causality. The climax is a montage of success that bypasses the friction required for a high-stakes payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong, atmospheric grounding with vivid imagery like "antennas sit like patient vertebrae." The setting feels alive and specific, effectively mirroring the narrator's internal state, though the description occasionally borders on density over clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the stakes (saving the station) are clear, the conflict lacks genuine heat because the opposition dissolves too easily. The "cost" of the victory is minimal—merely opening shutters and drawing—making the triumph feel inevitable rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is heavily sermonized in the final paragraphs ("Care here means learning how to listen..."), violating the subtext rule. Explicitly defining the moral takeaway reduces the narrative's resonance and treats the reader as a student rather than a participant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and controls the narrative distance well, establishing a distinct mood. However, the dialogue (summarized in the narrator's high poetic register) lacks naturalism, making the interaction with the crew feel like a monologue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from high figurative density ("glittering grit," "bruise that remembers healing") that sometimes obscures meaning. The beauty of the lines occasionally stalls the momentum rather than advancing the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "cosmic janitor" concept and the star-mapping method are imaginative and fresh. However, the plot arc—the soulful outsider teaching unfeeling bureaucrats to appreciate beauty—is a familiar trope that executes predictably.</comment>
