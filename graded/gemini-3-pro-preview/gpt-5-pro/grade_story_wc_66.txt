<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara is a distinct, purposeful protagonist whose specific skills as a copyist drive the story's unique magic system (annotating lyrics to animate dust). Her agency is clearly demonstrated when she chooses to "unshawl" the radio despite the established danger of the patrols, accepting the risk to answer the signal. The internal motivation ("teach dust to tell stories") perfectly aligns with her actions and the story's stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and effectively structured under a Situational/Accumulative lens, moving from private ritual to communal restoration. The "Orientation Test" passes easily, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's isolation is broken. The arrival of the stranger acts as a satisfying payoff to the established radio mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally integrated; the "ember alcove" and "dust" function as active tools rather than static backdrops, constraining Mara's methods and shaping the magic. Sensory details are vivid and specific ("rain on copper roofs," "cracked violin"), grounding the fantastical elements in a tangible reality that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tension escalates appropriately from the quiet famine to the active risk of the broadcast and the passing patrols. While the external threat (the boots trudging past) is resolved somewhat softly via avoidance, the internal pressure of Mara's choice to engage the signal provides sufficient narrative drive. The stakes of "erasure" are felt throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory and artistic resistance is organic to the plot mechanics, emerging through the act of copying and broadcasting rather than through exposition. The ending resonates with the idea of stories outlasting their tellers, though the final sentence leans slightly into summary ("songs teach what silence forgot").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, maintaining a fable-like distance that suits the magic realism. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Mara's understanding of the "arithmetic" and music, creating a distinct perceptual signature that colors the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally impedes momentum (e.g., "glow salted the mist with patient, sea-green arithmetic"). While the lyrical style is established early, the frequency of figurative language per sentence risks overwriting and triggers the rubric's density penalty, creating a texture that is sometimes more perfumed than propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of shortwave radio technology, orchestral notation, and dust-based magic is highly original and imaginative. The concept of a "story famine" is executed with fresh, specific imagery rather than generic tropes, offering a unique vision of resistance.</comment>
