<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrator is competent and distinct, with a clear voice and motivation. However, the secondary characters (the team) function largely as props without internal life, and the antagonist (Provost) lacks psychological depth, pivoting instantly upon exposure to the device without genuine struggle or negotiation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the causality of the technical solution is established early. The climax, however, relies on the technology working perfectly on the human antagonist to instantly resolve the threat, acting as a "magic bullet" that bypasses the need for a difficult interpersonal or moral choice at the peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are excellent, grounding the fantastical elements in a tactile reality ("smells of dust, coffee, and solder," "tastes like pennies"). The environment of the booth feels lived-in and specifically constrained, enhancing the atmosphere significantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation is managed well through the riot and the power cut, creating genuine pressure. The conflict resolution is softer; the "power play" of the administration is neutralized too easily by the protagonist's device, undercutting the stakes of the physical confrontation in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "radios as bridges" and healing through form is resonant and well-integrated into the action. While the final sentiment is slightly didactic ("healing is slower than harm"), it feels earned by the preceding imagery and the "ethereal grit" of the voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is strong, maintaining a consistent register that blends technical jargon with lyrical abstraction ("vacuum for boots"). The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature—viewing social unrest as signal interference—is distinctive and maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("clock salts the hour," "thin frost across the noise floor"). The density occasionally risks opacity with abstract metaphors in close succession, but the rhythm is propulsive and the imagery is consistently fresh.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of a radio operator battling cosmic tricksters with acoustics is a fresh, inventive synthesis of sci-fi and fantasy. The execution avoids standard tropes of the genre by focusing on "form" and "breath" rather than violence, offering a distinct creative vision.</comment>
