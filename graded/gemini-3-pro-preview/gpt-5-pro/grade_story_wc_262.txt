<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent functional expert ("more mapmaker than mystic") who performs a ritual with skill but lacks internal contradiction or vulnerability. While the voice is distinct, the character experiences no significant struggle or cost; they arrive, diagnose, and fix the problem without personal stakes or doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from diagnosis to a ritualistic resolution ("harvesting") that reconfigures the setting's energy. Closure is strong—the projection of the "blank leader" as "mercy" offers a resonant image that reweights the initial problem of "aching reels," though the resolution feels slightly frictionless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, serving as the physical interface for the story's magic; details like "ghosted popcorn" and "ceiling sheds glitter" create a tangible, haunted atmosphere. The projection booth is not just a backdrop but the constraint through which the plot operates (sprockets, splices, leaders).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conflict is largely atmospheric ("reels still ache," "building keeps getting heavier") rather than interpersonal or internal. While the pressure is coherent, the protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-offs; the solution (cutting and archiving) is executed without jeopardy, limiting the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "unused love" lingering in the mechanical non-image parts of film (leaders, splices) is poignant and structurally integrated. The concept avoids generic ghost tropes by grounding memory in the specific materiality of the medium, landing a resonant, non-moralizing emotional effect at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and authoritative ("alphabet of silver," "topography made of sprocket holes"), fitting the "magical expert" persona well. However, the tone is somewhat homogenous, maintaining a singular "poet-voice" intensity that risks flattening the dynamic between the narrator and the trembling manager.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is rich but occasionally dense with stacked metaphors ("unpacks like envelopes," "urgency like wind") that slow momentum. The phrase "hushed thunder" appears three times (lines 1, 20, 29), and "unused love" four times; while intended as motifs, the repetition feels like a lexical loop that reduces freshness in a short piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a "psychometric film repairman" finding emotion in the transparent leader tape is a fresh, specific synthesis of magical realism and analog nostalgia. It successfully transforms the "haunted theater" trope into a story about the mechanics of editing and memory.</comment>
