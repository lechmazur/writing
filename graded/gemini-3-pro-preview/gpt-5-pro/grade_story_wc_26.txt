<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator is a competent, coherent focalizer who performs their role with grace. However, the character feels somewhat static; they possess total mastery over the situation, facing no internal contradiction or hesitation, which limits the depth of the dramatic struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causality is excellent; the ritualistic progression from threat to resolution is logical and earned. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator sacrifices their personal tether (the stone) to bind the shadow, creating a tangible cost for the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, active, and integral to the narrative logic (e.g., shelves that quiver, petals that close). Sensory details like "ozone and far thunder" and "smells like lilac" ground the fantastical elements in specific, tactile experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the shadow vs. it being consumed—is clear, and the escalation through the film screening is well-paced. The cost is high (sacrificing the personal safety stone), though the shadow's submission to the process feels slightly too smooth to reach the highest bands of conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a stabilizing force against loss is handled with nuance and resonance. The final image of the book taking root offers a non-literal, emotionally satisfying answer to the central problem of "unbound" grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately atmospheric for the content. The control of distance is steady, maintaining the "sharp-eyed" persona throughout without slipping into unearned omniscience or jarring colloquialisms.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery ("storms queue like unplayed songs"). A few moments lean slightly toward the sentimental ("moths decided to become lanterns"), but the rhythm and density generally support the magical realism tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a library for dreams/souls is a familiar trope, but the specific execution—using silent film editing and a river stone anchor—adds a fresh layer. It is a high-quality iteration of an established sub-genre rather than a radical reinvention.</comment>
