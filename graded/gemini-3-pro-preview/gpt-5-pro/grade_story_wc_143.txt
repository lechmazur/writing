<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation to preserve the "unbranded dawn" is poignant and clear. However, the attribute "purposefully curious" is integrated via direct labeling ("my purposefully curious heart") rather than demonstrated action, feeling slightly like an inserted prompt check. The mentor relationship adds depth, though the mentor himself remains a standard archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The countdown structure provided by the sunrise and the chemical timer creates effective situational pressure. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sky is lost but the memory is secured—lands well. The synchronization of the chemical message with the sunrise is slightly convenient but narratively earned by the mentor's established skill.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the contrast between the pumice/cold iron and the "pale geometry" of the mirrors is vivid. The "crater lake shines like a pupil" is a strong image. The setting acts as a constraint, forcing the protagonist to wait in the cold, grounding the abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are high conceptually (loss of nature), and the pressure of the countdown is felt. However, the protagonist’s agency is limited to witnessing and enduring; the conflict is inevitable, leaving little room for active tactical shifts. The cost is realized emotionally rather than through a difficult choice between live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of commercial erasure vs. stubborn memory resonates strongly. The final image of the stone remembering impacts "without caring who paid for the light" is excellent. The critique of the "logos" is sharp, though occasionally on-the-nose ("beginning to sell dawn").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, meditative, and observant, fitting the "inspector" persona. It occasionally slips into over-poeticism that draws attention to the author rather than the character ("mouse of sound," "swallowing the Milky Way like bread").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the prose is dense and often lovely, it suffers from mixed or strained metaphors in key moments. "Logos comb their antlers" confuses the imagery (hunting vs. combing), and "swallowing the Milky Way like bread" feels awkward. These artifacts distract from the otherwise high-quality imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of orbital mirrors branding the sunrise is a fresh, specific update to the "encroaching dystopia" trope. The chemical timer is a clever, specific device. The execution follows a somewhat standard "last witness" trajectory, but the specific details elevate it.</comment>
