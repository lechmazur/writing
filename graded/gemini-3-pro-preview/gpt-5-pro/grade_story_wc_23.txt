<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is rich and distinct, successfully grounding the high-concept role in the physical labor of the signal station. The relationship with Rowan provides a critical emotional anchor, turning abstract "loss" into a specific, felt connection that drives the scene's urgency. The choice to cannibalize the mother's censer for the counterweight demonstrates clear agency and character prioritization under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving efficiently from the inciting mechanical failure to the resourceful solution and successful guidance. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration; the "reverse migration" is not just a theme but the enacted plot, ending with a moment of earned stasis that feels complete and costly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting functions as a dynamic constraint rather than a static backdrop; the broken hydraulics and the specific mechanics of the dish directly shape the protagonist's actions. The atmosphere is vivid and immersive ("moon is a careful bone," "rib cage of pilings"), effectively merging the surreal environment with the technical task.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and sustained, driven by the immediate mechanical failure and the remote peril of the convoy. The escalation is handled well through the "night-sips" and the translation of the stars, though the obstacles faced by the convoy are slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of connection across the "geography of loss" is powerfully integrated with the physical action of the story. The use of the censer foot—a relic of personal loss—to enable the signal for others creates a sophisticated resonance that answers the central dramatic question without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, successfully maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the surreal landscape. The shift between technical details ("counterweight," "tide wheel") and poetic interpretation ("scab of stars") is handled seamlessly, establishing a unique perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, though the density of figurative language ("metal throat," "ghosts of circuits," "careful bone") occasionally borders on overwriting. The imagery is consistently strong, but the relentless poetic intensity in the opening beats slightly risks obscuring the immediate physical reality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic survival with the specific, tactile mechanics of the signal station and the censer foot is highly original. The concept of "reverse migration" is executed with a fresh, specific vision that avoids standard genre tropes.</comment>
