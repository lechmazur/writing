<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The protagonist is vividly drawn as a stoic sage, but his "brazen calm" and near-perfect competence reduce the sense of struggle or risk. While the internal landscape of facing mortality is rich, the character functions more as an archetype of wisdom than a flawed individual navigating a crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative pivots on an external event (the storm opening the pillar) rather than direct protagonist agency, which softens the causal drive. The closure lands as a "manifesto" (Conceptual Repricing) that resolves the arc intellectually, but the "inevitable" success lacks the tension of a hard-won victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "living stone" orchard is an exceptional, active setting that constrains the protagonist's methods and dictates the plot's rhythm. The environment is not just a backdrop but a participant, though the score is capped by the Q2 causality ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are high (mortality), but the immediate scene conflict is low-friction; the orchard yields its secrets to the caretaker without significant resistance or error. The "tightening" comes from the storm rather than a pressure-cooker choice by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of interspecies kinship is resonant but is delivered through explicit diagnostic statements ("missed the simplest lesson," "remodel not the stones' nature but our own"). This tendency to explain the meaning diminishes the power of the subtext in the final act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and authoritative, fitting the fable-like tone perfectly. However, the reliance on repetitive "X like Y" simile structures creates a formulaic rhythm that occasionally flattens the distinctiveness of the narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with sensory detail ("nut skin and crushed lightning"), but suffers from marked simile fatigue. The frequent use of "like" constructions ("like reed flutes," "like bells," "like whales," "like surf") creates a noticeable rhythmic scaffold that distracts from the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of architectural magic, botanical science, and "electric grammar" offers a genuinely fresh and imaginative concept. The "living alignments" twist on the "architectural secrets" prompt element is clever and well-integrated.</comment>
