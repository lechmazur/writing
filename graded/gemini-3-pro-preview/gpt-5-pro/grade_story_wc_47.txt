<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is rich but relies heavily on diagnostic self-labeling ("What I am now is quietly proactive") rather than purely dramatized traits. Miri serves as a supportive foil, and while their dynamic is gentle and functional, the lack of interpersonal friction keeps the emotional pressure low. The choice to repurpose the pendant is well-motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well for this quiet, post-climactic reflection. The narrative moves logically from the return to the specific labor, anchoring the closure (a refusal to speak publicly yet) in the physical act of gardening. The orientation is clear, and the pacing suits the introspective mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the "abandoned data center turned moss garden" is not just scenery but a constraint that shapes the action (planting in server racks, following icicle drips). The sensory details are vivid and specific ("brush made from cable sleeving"), grounding the lyricism in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal—reconciling the public "viral" persona with private healing. The pressure is low-key, but the reconfiguration of the pendant (bribe to sun-catcher) provides a tangible beat of change. The ending achieves an Earned Stasis, foreclosing the option of immediate public speech with a legible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of repurposing trauma is resonant and consistent. However, the text tends to articulate the subtext explicitly in dialogue and narration ("It is not penance... it is practice"), which flattens the ambiguity slightly. The resonance is strong, but the moral is handed to the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively evoking the "watchful dreamer" persona. The high-register poeticism is sustained well, though it occasionally creates a sense of detachment from the raw reality of the "wounds."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from metaphor density that occasionally slows momentum. A notable artifact is the repetition of the "metronome" simile (pendant as "tender metronome," Miri nods "like a metronome") within a short span, which breaks immersion. The prompt word "proffer" also repeats noticeably.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of high-tech ruin and organic restoration creates a fresh, striking aesthetic. While the "gardening as healing" trope is familiar, the specific context of the data center and the icicle-algorithm mapping adds a unique layer of ingenuity.</comment>
