<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is vividly rendered, balancing the intellectual obsession of the scientist with the emotional weight of being a "blessed pariah." The choice to stay is justified by a distinct worldview ("turn confusion into exploration"), and the final realignment feels like an earned expression of character rather than just a plot mechanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc follows a clean Causal/Accumulative hybrid line: observation leads to hypothesis, which drives the physical realignment of the deck. The closure functions well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the instrument from a failed state to a new, enduring alignment ("north by endurance"). The pacing effectively mirrors the slow, heavy atmosphere of the setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral and active; the time dilation effects (shadows stretching, hands moving twice) constrain perception and reinforce the isolation. The deck feels like a specific, lived-in machine rather than a generic sci-fi backdrop, with the "echoed silence" and "residual gradients" grounding the scene physically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure is consistent but relatively low-stakes; the conflict is primarily intellectual (solving the drift) and atmospheric rather than urgent or opposing. While the internal drive to align the machine is clear, the lack of immediate external pressure or active opposition limits the tension to a contemplative register. The cost is paid in isolation, which is accepted early rather than struggled against.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "true north" as an internal/enduring orientation rather than a magnetic point is woven tightly into the plot mechanics. The integration of the mother's lesson with the astrophysical calibration is effective, though the explicit articulation of the moral ("true north was not a magnet...") borders on didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, blending scientific precision with a lyrical, almost liturgical reverence for the work. However, the reliance on simile to describe nearly every sensation creates a rhythmic monotony that slightly distances the reader from the immediacy of the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant simile saturation ("like spare cutlery," "like a black rope," "like a lens," "like a catalog," "like wet cloth," "like mending it," "like a liturgy," etc.). This relentless "like [noun]" construction becomes a scaffold artifact that creates a repetitive cadence and draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The density of figurative language obscures the clarity of the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a time dilation deck left behind is a fresh take on the "last watchman" trope, and treating temporal drift as a vector to be mapped is a clever synthesis. The specific ritual of sketching stars to calibrate a high-tech instrument adds a unique, tactile layer to the sci-fi concept.</comment>
