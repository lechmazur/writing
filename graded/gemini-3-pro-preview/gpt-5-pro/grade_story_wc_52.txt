<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The widow's characterization is grounded in specific, embodied details like the "wrist ache" and the "hauntingly practical" craft learned from the husband. Her internal landscape is rich, blending memory with the immediate physical task, though the emotional trajectory is slightly predictable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constrained by the "kettle boiling" timeframe, creating an effective Accumulative structure. The closure creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where the finished object re-contextualizes her grief, landing with earned weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly "sawdust like small summers" and the "rust-hued peace." The setting actively constrains the protagonist, forcing a focus on the micro-world of the workbench against the backdrop of the storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The internal conflict between the "wildness" of grief and the need for containment is palpable. The rising whistle of the kettle provides an effective, if simple, escalation mechanic that parallels the rising pressure of memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story tends to explicate its themes rather than trusting the imagery ("Waiting, she understands, is not nothing," "shape is a way to go on"). This didacticism flattens the subtext, turning potential resonance into stated moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical rhythm throughout. However, it occasionally acts as a "helpful narrator," over-interpreting the symbols for the reader rather than allowing them to stand alone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While rhythmically strong, the prose suffers from mixed or opaque metaphors like "scent dry and green as unfinished thunder." The repetitive "She thinks of..." structure near the end creates a scaffolded list effect that stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The central conceit—carving a cage to house a sugar crystal and a lock of hair—is a genuinely fresh and poignant synthesis of the grief trope. It elevates the standard "widow remembering" narrative into something tactile and specific.</comment>
