<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and the "meditative" attribute is well-dramatized through the ribbon method. However, the grandmother's role as a guide somewhat dampens the protagonist's own agency in the climax, making the internal struggle feel slightly passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds coherently to the "heaviest evening," and the loosening of the braid offers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The reliance on the grandmother's direct instruction to solve the central puzzle slightly softens the causal tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is excellently integrated, functioning as both tool and atmosphere; the specific interplay of vines, mist, and stone firmly grounds the abstract concept of "collective grief" in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined but remain low-pressure and aesthetic; the "cost" of untying the braid is conceptual rather than visceral. The climax relies on external advice (the grandmother) rather than a forced, high-risk choice by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shift from a "braid that held" to "hollows" effectively reprices the theme of grief without moralizing. The final image of the stone receiving rather than proclaiming resonates strongly with the established motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is consistent and fits the "fiercely meditative" persona. At times, the poetic register feels slightly self-conscious (e.g., "chisel dares to speak"), but the perceptual signature is stable and unified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, though metaphors occasionally clash or strain (e.g., "silence itself were anvil and balm," "punctuation had traveled through their thin bones"). The repetition of "thundering calm" works as a frame but the oxymoron itself is slightly clunky.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving with greenhouse botany and ribbon-weaving creates a fresh, specific methodology. While the "spectral mentor" is a familiar trope, the mechanical execution via poetry exchange feels original.</comment>
