<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is rich, and the shift from "burden" to "mercy" drives a clear agency-filled choice at the climax (recharting the echo). The motivation is established early and paid off, though the character functions somewhat as a vessel for the lyrical aesthetic rather than a gritty, lived-in individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from exploration to discovery to intervention with clear causality established by the diary entries. The resolution—altering the echo—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the ease of the "humming" fix slightly lowers the sense of struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the drowned museum, inverted light of the negative, and acoustic textures create a unique, constraint-filled environment. The setting actively shapes the method of resolution (sound/echo), integrating perfectly with the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes are personal and historical; the tension between the grandmother's ruthless choice and the narrator's merciful one is compelling. The escalation works well, though the climax resolves via a somewhat soft magic system (humming away trauma) rather than a harder sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing history is poignant, but the ending resorts to explicit sermonizing ("maps must learn to comfort," "responsibility shaped like attention"). This summarizes the subtext that had already been successfully dramatized, flattening the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, fitting the magical realism tone. It maintains a distinct perceptual signature throughout, though it occasionally risks becoming too precious with its metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and dense with imagery ("tiles etched like topographies," "walls dream in montage"). A few metaphors feel slightly strained or mixed ("groaned like a throat swallowing rain," "slumped like wilted fins"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of an "echo cartographer" mapping the "soft choreography" of sound in a post-climate world is genuinely fresh and imaginative. The synthesis of medium (film negatives) and sound to access the past is inventive.</comment>
