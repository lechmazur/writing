<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The protagonist possesses a distinct, lyrical voice and a clear philosophical arc moving from recording to tending. However, the character feels somewhat archetypal and sage-like, lacking the raw, contradictory interiority or specific personal flaws that create deep emotional friction. The "human ink" realization is beautiful but arrives through observation rather than a visceral, messy struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery and the arrival of refugees. Closure is achieved via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the keeper chooses patience over escape. The pacing is deliberate, though the link between the refugees and the final crack feels sequential rather than strictly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly realized and actively constrains the narrative; the library’s roots, the obsidian refuge, and the "sweating" stones are not just backdrop but physical forces shaping the protagonist's tools and choices. The "origami swan" functioning as a map is an excellent integration of object and setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Conflict is largely man-versus-entropy, escalating effectively from the child's arrival to the city's destruction and finally the library's fracture. The stakes are clear, though the protagonist's internal struggle is quiet and philosophical. The climax choice—restraining the swan to "wait"—is a valid meaningful tightening, though the cost remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing versus fixing is woven seamlessly into the action, particularly in the refusal to "claim" the child or "redeem" the refugees' stories. The final shift to "tending" offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central question of how to endure change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, authoritative, and deeply atmospheric, fitting the persona of a chronicle keeper perfectly. The lyrical register is sustained without breaking, though the high-poetic tone creates a slight distance that prevents full emotional intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but suffers from metaphorical density that occasionally slows momentum ("moths that had outgrown the idea of flame," "lightning that forgot to vanish"). While the imagery is striking, the relentless layering of figurative language draws attention to the writing itself rather than the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "living library" trope with specific elements like the obsidian refuge and origami navigation creates a fresh, distinct world. The choice to focus on "tending" rather than heroic saving helps avoid cliché, offering a thoughtful take on the fantasy custodian archetype.</comment>
