<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct, combining spectral detachment with sensory urgency, and their motivation to prompt an "encore" of courage drives the narrative effectively. Rowan acts as a clear focal point for this pressure, though her internal shift relies heavily on the narrator's magical intervention rather than independent agency. The emotional logic holds, with the ghost's desire for repetition contrasting poignantly with the human need for progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal arc from despair to renewal, anchored by the coin flip and the maze's reaction. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (Rowan's recommitment), though the resolution feels slightly convenient; the maze magically rearranging to reveal the solution lowers the sense of earned difficulty. The drive lens (Causal/Accumulative) remains stable, delivering a coherent if somewhat gentle ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist/ally; the "hedges stitched with half-remembered applause" and chiming pears are vivid and integral. The environment constrains and guides the characters, with the maze's rearrangement serving as the pivotal plot mechanism. Sensory details are strictly filtered through the narrator's synesthetic perspective, creating a unified and immersive world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (despair vs. possibility) is signaled early and tracked through Rowan's behavior. While the pressure escalates with her midnight entry, the resolution comes relatively easily via the supernatural aid of the coin and the maze, softening the cost of the final choice. The conflict is resolved, but the lack of a sharper sacrifice or obstacle limits the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "encore" as a reprisal of courage rather than just applause is seamlessly integrated into the plot and setting. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central problem without moralizing, using the theater metaphors to reframe the gardening work. The synthesis of memory and future action ("knot I recognize from a final bow") creates a lingering, meaningful aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and highly stylized without losing clarity. The synesthetic descriptions ("taste of lime," "hearing hammers in plum") are maintained with discipline, reinforcing the character's unique perception. The POV distance is managed well, observing Rowan closely while maintaining the ghost's specific limitations and knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery like "back door yawns toward the hedge maze." The synesthetic metaphors are bold ("taste like green brass hope") but consistent with the established voice rules. There are no significant artifacts or drag; every line advances the atmosphere or the plot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a "stage ghost" tending a "garden of echoes" creates a fresh, specific synthesis of theater and nature tropes. The perspective reframes a standard "restoring hope" narrative into something texturally unique. The execution feels innovative, particularly in how theater logic is applied to the behavior of the plants.</comment>
