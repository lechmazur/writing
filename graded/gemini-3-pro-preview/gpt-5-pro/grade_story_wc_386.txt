<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent, atmospheric functionary who drives the ritual with clear motivation ("salvage something pure"). However, the character reads more as a role than a person; internal conflict is minimal, and the "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" self-definition feels like an inserted label rather than an organic identity. The ghost’s agency in choosing the globe adds a welcome spark of specific characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, effective ritual structure from arrival to revelation, with the "dreams" logic established early to justify the method. Closure is distinct and satisfying, delivering the name "Leda" and a commitment to action (exposure) that reconfigures the protagonist's path. Orientation in the ice shrine is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, sensory-rich details like "long throat of ice" and "blue cathedral" that actively shape the mood. The environment pressures the ritual, with the ice "listening" and candles "sealing tears," integrating the physical space tightly with the metaphysical stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes of recovering truth against erasure are clear, and the ritual progresses coherently to the revelation. However, the conflict is largely procedural; the ghost and the ice offer no active resistance, making the success feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost is conceptual (the weight of the name) rather than a visceral price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving truth against the "owner's lie" and the entropy of time is handled with resonant imagery. The motif of "names cross water better than bodies" lands a strong emotional punch, and the ending successfully reframes the salvage mission as an act of justice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, fitting the "ghost whisperer" persona. However, the natural cadence is frequently disrupted by the mechanical insertion of verbatim prompt phrases ("weaves truth carefully," "analyzing cameo appearances"), which renders the narration stiff and expository in key moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the prose contains striking images ("bruise under my tongue"), the text suffers from significant repetition and scaffold artifacts. Key phrases ("borrowed starlight," "windows of connection," "cameo appearance") appear multiple times as identical strings, creating a "checklist" texture that undermines the otherwise high polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a Titanic-style tragedy with a supernatural dream-investigator is fresh and compelling. The concept of reconstructing truth from the "cameo appearances" in survivors' dreams is ingenious, even if the execution relies too heavily on repetitive labeling of these elements.</comment>
