<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict—fusing insight with empathy without drowning—creates a distinct, compelling interiority. The dynamic of "selling adoption papers, not offspring" establishes a unique, emotionally resonant constraint that shapes every interaction on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving from a clear inciting need to a resonant closure where the transaction alters the client while leaving the dealer in a costly stasis. The concept of the "bridge" provides a satisfying, tangible resolution to the abstract problem of grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is essential to the narrative logic; the amber grotto acts as a conductor for the "static" magic system, integrating atmosphere with plot mechanics. Sensory details like "labdanum and tears" and "resinous stone" create a vivid, immersive texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (grief vs. function) and escalate effectively through the diagnosis and calibration beats. The resolution is earned through the client’s "confession," and the cost—accepting a "careful lie" to survive—is legible and thematic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "half truths" as necessary emotional bridges is sophisticated and tightly woven into the story's mechanics. The ending offers a nuanced perspective on healing, valuing function and survival over purity without becoming didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly embodying the "affectionate detachment" required. The shift from professional assessment to emotional alchemy is handled with seamless control of the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and evocative ("fish hear riverbeds"), though the metaphorical saturation is intense and occasionally risks overwriting. A minor capitalization artifact ("Fragrance chemist's") slightly disrupts the visual flow, but the rhythm remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of an "emotion dealer" trope with the specific mechanics of static electricity and amber creates a fresh, distinctive magic system. The concept of "counterfeit" emotions as a mercy rather than a deception offers a unique emotional angle.</comment>
