<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s skepticism is consistently embodied in voice and action, avoiding stock cynicism. The shift from ruthless debunking to protecting the caretaker's secret feels earned by the specific interaction and carries a visible change in stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands effectively with a distinct ethical choice that resolves the central tension. However, the pivotal discovery mechanism—reconstructing loose shredded papers found in a wind-battered ruin—strains physical plausibility and feels convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "stillpoint" is rendered with exceptional sensory specificity ("ticking like cooled glass"), functioning as a micro-setting that physically constrains the characters and grounds the myth in tangible physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict between the professional drive to expose and the human need for "comfortable lies" is well-braided. The resolution involves a felt professional cost, compromising the "whole truth" to preserve the orchard's function.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The exploration of engineering masquerading as miracle is resonant and organic. The thematic synthesis is strong, though the final dialogue ("truth rearranges a life") states the subtext slightly too explicitly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistently observant, blending technical curiosity with poetic perception. The investigative filter remains stable and controls the pacing well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with arresting, original imagery ("cataract catching a star," "leaves like polished armor") that serves the tone perfectly. The rhythm is propulsive with no visible scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reimagining the "cursed orchard" as a functional remediation project offers a fresh, grounded subversion of the trope. The synthesis of industrial decay and natural beauty feels specific and non-obvious.</comment>
