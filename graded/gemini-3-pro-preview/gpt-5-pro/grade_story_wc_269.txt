<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's identity as a "witness" is not merely a label but the engine of the story's methodology; the transition from counting absences in reefs to counting rhythms in the tide is psychologically astute and causally tight. Interiority is distinct, blending scientific discipline with personal grief, though the interaction with Jun serves more as a plot device than a crucible for character friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative trajectory that pivots effectively into Causal action. The discovery of the "node" feels slightly convenient—Jun simply supplying the key word reduces the protagonist's agency in the epiphany—but the closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of how the community navigates the landscape with visible cost (safety is "never guaranteed").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral, acting as both antagonist and constraint; the specific physical reality of the station and the flats dictates the pacing and the solution. Sensory details like "sunsoft," "basement rain," and the "reflective sand" ground the speculative elements in a tactile, lived-in reality that directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated (drownings, the loss of history), and the conflict between human memory and tidal erasure is poignant. While the pressure escalates coherently through the data analysis, the on-page tension remains cerebral; the physical danger is historical rather than immediate, keeping the pulse of the story contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation over restoration—"we do not restore the reefs"—lands with profound resonance. The story integrates its core concept of "delayed revelation" seamlessly into the plot, delivering a non-literal, wise answer to the central question that reweights the initial grief into a functional, if fragile, future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, successfully merging the lexicon of a technician with the soul of a poet. The rhythm of the prose mirrors the tapping method, reinforcing the story's central motif, though at times the metaphor density ("gulls heckle like unpaid auditors") threatens to overtake the scene's reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished, rhythmic, and high-density, propelling the narrative without drag. Line-level craft is strong, with only minor diction stumbles (e.g., "foxed" applied to a battery is an opaque choice) that do not mar the overall clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal science, rhythmic communication, and the specific artifact of the atlas page creates a fresh, non-obvious take on post-climate-change fiction. The solution—marking nodes with flexible beacons—feels specific and earned rather than generic.</comment>
