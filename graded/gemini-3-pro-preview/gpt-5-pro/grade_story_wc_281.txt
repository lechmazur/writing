<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal state—overwhelmed by sensory input yet eager to harness it—is portrayed with visceral specificity. Mara’s role as an anchor is effective, though her "affectionate skeptic" label feels slightly prescriptive rather than fully dramatized through friction; their alignment is perhaps too smooth, lacking the grit of harder choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative moves cleanly from the inciting shock to the choreographic experiment and resolution. The discovery of the hidden path to the loft relies on poetic logic—light revealing dust patterns—which strains strict causality but fits the accumulative/textural lens. Closure is earned through the grounding action and the decisive lie to the recall notice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are excellent, blending the technical (fiber wands, breakers) with the organic (muscovite, ozone). The studio feels lived-in and tactile. The environment actively shapes the method of the art, grounding the metaphysical concept in physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pressure is primarily internal and aesthetic—managing the noise—rather than interpersonal or external. While the recall notice adds a background threat, the stakes remain relatively low-key; the "cost" is a manageable secret. The tension is steady but lacks a sharp, escalating peak before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of translating invisible noise into navigable connection is handled with sophistication. The synthesis of technology, geology, and empathy creates a resonant subtext about "neighborliness" in a crowded mental landscape. The final image recontextualizes the city’s noise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, matching the artist-protagonist’s perception. The transition from internal chaos to ordered light is reflected in the sentence rhythm. Occasional phrases teeter on preciousness ("quietly closed fist"), but the overall texture is consistent and high-quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with no scaffolding or loops. The imagery is precise ("limp-clicking," "small, patient train"). The integration of the prompt phrase "willowglass" is a bit forced ("willowglass hope made mineral"), slightly disrupting the otherwise grounded semantic field, but the surrounding craft is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of light painting, bio-feedback, and telepathy is genuinely fresh and ingenious. It avoids the cliché of telepathy-as-madness, pivoting instead to telepathy-as-artistic-material. The use of the geode as a lens for thought is a memorable, specific innovation.</comment>
