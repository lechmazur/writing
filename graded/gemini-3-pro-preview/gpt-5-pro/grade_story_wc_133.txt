<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The insomniac painter's motivation ("thresh meaning") drives the narrative efficiently, and the internal voice is consistent. However, the trait "wryly earnest" is told rather than dramatized, and the character faces little internal contradiction or agonizing choice, resulting in a functional but linear arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, moving logically from the brooch discovery to the mural's execution with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. While the discovery of the map in the cistern feels somewhat convenient, the structure supports the thematic outcome without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is exceptional, with the environment actively constraining the investigation ("following rain trails," "tide slid back"). The setting details—from the "blistered mural" to the "feral fresco" of algae—deeply charge the final image of rain interacting with the painted lines.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully from personal curiosity to community adaptation, creating a clear sense of purpose. However, the narrative lacks active opposition or significant pressure; the path to resolution is relatively unobstructed, preventing the tension from reaching higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of reconstruction through observation and work integrates well with the plot mechanics. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, though the explicit statement of motivation ("thresh meaning") leans slightly on the nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, maintaining a consistent "insomniac" texture that suits the reflective pacing. The transition from the solitary opening to the communal ending is handled with a stable, controlled tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally threatens momentum ("tide like a tired lung," "ribs ring like brass"). Additionally, the verbatim repetition of unique phrases like "haggard awe" and "unearthed convergence" within a short space creates noticeable lexical artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of "rain cartography"—mapping runoff to control floods—is a fresh and ingenious specific within the familiar post-apocalyptic genre. The synthesis of art and utility offers a distinct angle, though the broader world-building elements are standard.</comment>
