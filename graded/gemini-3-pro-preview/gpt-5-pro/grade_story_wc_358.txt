<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent professional with clear agency, driving the investigation through expertise. However, the character functions more as a method than a person; emotional interiority is somewhat abstract ("learning to move before the air decides"), relying on the "ghost" of the engineer to supply the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causality is excellent; the investigation proceeds through precise, logical steps to a specific physical solution (the empty square and unlatched door). The closure—imposing a new "breathing grid" protocol—is a Decisive Change that is fully earned by the preceding survey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The portrayal of the port as a wind instrument ("breathing grid," "narrow lungs") is masterful and strictly integral to the plot mechanism. The setting acts as the primary antagonist and constraint, with the container layout directly dictating the tragedy and the solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Procedural tension is managed well, but the retrospective nature of the investigation limits immediate personal jeopardy or active opposition. The stakes are high for the town's future but low for the narrator in the scene, resulting in a cooler, intellectual pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central theme of foresight versus hindsight is coherent but explicitly stated ("I am here to cultivate foresight"). While the "singular convergence" motif resolves nicely, the final paragraph leans slightly didactic in articulating the moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinct, elevated register ("radios mutter," "clipped syllable") that aligns perfectly with the "hazy precision" concept. It is consistent and controlled, though occasionally the poeticism feels slightly self-conscious.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("ribboned telltales," "soot V"), mixing technical detail with strong imagery. A few phrases veer into overwriting ("gulls draw gray commas," "ink slightly salted"), but the information density and rhythm remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of "wind forensics" in a container port is fresh and executed with specific, believable physical logic. The twist on "singular convergence"—transforming it from a strategy to a trap—is a clever, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
