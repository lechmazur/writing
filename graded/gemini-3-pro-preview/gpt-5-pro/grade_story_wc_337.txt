<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator is distinct, balancing professional detachment with deep empathy ("sometimes see my own face"). The daughter’s agency is well-integrated through the ritual assistance, and the mutual exchange of secrets adds necessary emotional stakes to the magical operation. Internal contradictions are subtle but present in the "lucid unrest" that persists despite the job's completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from a clear objective to a satisfyingly surreal resolution that feels earned by the established logic. The causal link between the physical action (untying knots) and the metaphysical result (raising the coffer) is intuitive and compelling. Closure is definitive, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the daughter's burden and the narrator's ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant; the sanctuary "accumulates silence" and "tilts to listen," constraining and shaping the ritual. The physical details—glass ribs, quartz floor, the smell of kelp and coins—are vivid and create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere that grounds the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tension is braided effectively between the physical stubbornness of the knots and the emotional weight of the daughter's secret fear. While the conflict is quiet and atmospheric, the stakes feel genuine, and the "tremor" during the ritual provides a tangible beat of escalation that anchors the metaphysical work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of mending as a form of mapping and release is beautifully woven through the narrative without becoming didactic. The concept of exchange—a sack for a service, a promise for a binding—adds a layer of moral complexity that resonates in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "lucid" tone that fits the magical realist genre perfectly. The narrator’s perspective filters the world through a lens of geometry and restoration, creating a distinct perceptual signature that unifies the prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, though occasionally the metaphorical weight teeters on overwrought (e.g., "tremor is a kind of music," "thank you is a tide"). While the "eyes of the sea at noon" is a slight cliché in an otherwise fresh text, the line-level craft generally supports the story's dreamlike logic with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—untying a fisherman's net to "exhume" a spirit coffer—is a highly original synthesis of maritime and spiritual tropes. The transformation of a standard exorcism into a tactile restoration ritual feels fresh and specifically grounded in the story’s unique world.</comment>
