<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict—restraint versus the need to grieve—is palpable and drives the central choice. However, the emotional climax relies on diagnostic labeling ("mnemonic, precise, and real") rather than purely embodied experience, which distances the reader slightly at the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change where the narrator abandons caution for necessary pain. The causal chain is tight, linking the mechanical opening of the flower directly to the emotional opening of the vial, with the cost of grief clearly felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific requirements of the greenhouse and the ultraviolet interactions constrain choices and shape the imagery. The sensory details ("river stone and cinnamon," "bruise-purple glow") are vivid and purposeful, charging the final atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from the technical setup to the emotional release, braiding the external plant experiment with the internal struggle. The stakes are personal and clear, though the external obstacle (opening the plant) is low-resistance compared to the internal barrier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory and grief is resonant and well-integrated into the speculative mechanics. However, dialogue occasionally drifts into thematic exposition ("memories were weights tied to scents"), stating the subtext rather than letting the action carry it entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, establishing a strong melancholic mood. The narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though the high-poetic register risks feeling performative in moments of high technical focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>While the imagery is dense, the prose suffers from overwriting and mixed metaphors ("smiled like a patient storm," "eyes to fountains"). Crucially, the climax intellectualizes the emotion with diagnostic adjectives ("mnemonic, precise") instead of trusting the raw action, reducing immediate impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lantern broker, extinct botany, and memory-chemistry is highly inventive and fresh. The specific mechanism of ultraviolet light revealing genetic memory adds a unique layer to the familiar trope of grief, feeling inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
