<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and leads to a costly choice, but the reliance on diagnostic label-speak ("cultivated fortified vulnerability") to define internal state weakens the characterization. The final action is strong, but the self-definition feels like a prompt insertion rather than organic interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structuring is excellent, with a tight causal chain from the discovery of the tool marks to the decision to leak the report. Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the "Decisive Change" criteria with a tangible career cost paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the specific physical evidence (gouged paint, scratch marks, narrow walkway) drives the deduction and the climax. The sensory details ("tide line of silt," "rusted echo") are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established and escalated; the tension between the director's voice and the physical evidence builds effectively. The choice to defy authority carries a legible price ("ruin careers"), ensuring the conflict matters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thematic braiding of the Underground Railroad with modern labor injustice is poignant and well-executed through the lantern symbol. While the "entangled memories" phrasing is slightly heavy-handed, the conceptual resonance lands well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, atmospheric, and consistent. However, the integration of specific prompt phrases feels mechanical, creating momentary lapses in the otherwise immersive persona.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the imagery is often striking, the text suffers from repetitive artifacts ("reverberate" appears three times; "fortified vulnerability" and "entangled memories" twice). These loops within a short space clutter the prose and feel like checklist insertions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic procedural with ancestral spiritualism offers a fresh, specific angle. The "preventable death investigator" role is used to great effect, grounding the speculative elements in tangible work.</comment>
