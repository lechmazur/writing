<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict—professional obedience versus supernatural intuition—drives a high-stakes decision (playing the discordant harmonic) that feels earned and character-specific. The "lately inspired" trait is not just a label but is dramatized as a heightened sensitivity that compels the climax, showing strong agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a Situational/Causal hybrid lens where the ghost's warning forces a decisive action with immediate, visible consequences (the collapse). Closure is impactful, resolving the physical threat while leaving a resonant conceptual cost in the collective denial ("pretend nothing spoke to us").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the flooded pit isn't just atmospheric but serves as the medium for the ghost's communication (water stains). Sensory details like the smell of rope, damp paper, and the rising water creates a claustrophobic, tangible environment that heightens the urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tension escalates flawlessly from the decoding of the message to the impending downbeat. The climax relies on a singular, decisive act of disruption that carries professional risk and immediate physical payoff, satisfying the need for protagonist agency in resolving the threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "in between spaces"—both in architecture and music—is woven organically into the ghost story logic without feeling heavy-handed. The ending recontextualizes the experience as a secret shared between the living and the dead, offering a profound conceptual resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice maintains a consistent, lyrical melancholia suited to a musician, utilizing auditory metaphors that deepen the characterization. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing the supernatural elements to feel grounded in the protagonist's specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric, with strong density and rhythm. A few similes lean slightly toward the ornate ("sliced the air like cracked glass," "indecisive fireflies"), but the overall line-level craft effectively supports the story's mood and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a ghost communicating via water damage on a program is inventive and visually striking. Resolving the crisis through a "wrong note" rather than dialogue disrupts the standard warning trope, adding a layer of professional nuance that feels fresh.</comment>
