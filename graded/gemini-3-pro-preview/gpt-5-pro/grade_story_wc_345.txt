<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The collective "We" creates a unified protagonist that lacks internal friction; the declaration that "nobody refused" flattens agency and removes the potential for reluctance or doubt. The characters function as obedient enactors of instructions rather than active agents making difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear procedural structure—instruction, execution, success—where the outcome feels pre-ordained by the ghost's competence. The closure brings relief without a complication or "failure state" that would test the plan, resulting in a resolution with low causal tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with "floating rock arches" and "deserted sidewalks" creating a distinct, atmospheric logic that shapes the ritual. Specific sensory details, like the "pickled pears" and the bell's sound, effectively ground the fable-like tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the external stakes of drought are high, the narrative pressure is neutralized by the community's perfect cooperation and immediate trust. The absence of interpersonal conflict or significant operational setbacks means the victory is achieved without a palpable on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of collective healing is coherent but culminates in an explicit moral written on the sidewalk, violating the preference for subtext. This didactic "thematic echo" ("planet rings best when your voices braid") reduces the ending's resonance to a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "We" voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the mythic mode, maintaining a steady rhythm. The transition to the singular "I" for the final beat is handled smoothly, though the collective perspective keeps emotional immediacy at a distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished but repetitive in structure, with many paragraphs opening on a "We [verb]" template that creates a droning cadence. While imagery is dense, some metaphors ("dew could not swallow," "woolen body") border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi elements (nebula, orchard planet) with ghost-story tropes creates a fresh aesthetic. However, the underlying plot arc is a standard "community ritual" enactment that lacks a subversive twist or unique structural risk.</comment>
