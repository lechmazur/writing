<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle is vivid, but the shift from portrait artist to lighthouse mechanic relies on convenience rather than established competence. The epiphany is earned conceptually, but the physical capability to repair the mechanism using tarot cards as a guide strains character consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly, but the causal link between the tarot spread and the mechanical repair is symbolic rather than logical ("made a kind of map"). The resolution of the physical problem feels slightly like a soft reset, as the "untangling" is described as gentle and therapeutic rather than a struggle with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is excellent, with sensory details like "sleeping kelp" and "fogbones" grounding the surreal premise. The setting actively constrains the protagonist, forcing her descent into the "belly" to resolve the plot, meeting the criteria for high integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (artistic identity, saving ships), and the storm provides effective external pressure. However, the climax lacks visceral difficulty; the mechanical fix is portrayed as "too simple," which reduces the tension of the final hurdle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is coherent, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("she would answer that the world is a lighthouse..."). This "sermonizing ending" replaces scene pressure with a summarized thesis statement, triggering the specific penalty for Q5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively maintaining the "luminescent ache" tone throughout. The POV remains close and controlled, filtering observations through the artist's specific, metaphor-rich lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and rhythmic ("rattled like a little heart"), though occasionally adjective-heavy ("crestfallen portrait artist"). "Fogbones" is a creative coinage, but the density of figurative language borders on overwriting in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the tarot box, lighthouse repair, and artistic block creates a fresh, if slightly dream-logic, narrative. The concept of "redesigning" vision through maintenance is a strong, non-obvious angle on the prompt.</comment>
