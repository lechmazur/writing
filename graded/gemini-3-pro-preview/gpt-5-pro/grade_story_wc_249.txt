<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates strong agency through the specific "drumming" method, defying the passive role of a "guinea pig." The internal conflict between the desire to save Jonah and the acceptance of the "blur" as a cost is compelling and well-dramatized. The trait "quietly rebellious" is explicitly stated twice, which feels slightly mechanical, but it successfully drives the decision to ignore the "muzzle of reassurance."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from the setup of the experiment to a clear breakthrough and a resonant conclusion. Closure is achieved through "Charged Poise"—the protagonist accepts the ongoing cost (the blurring of self) to maintain the connection. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural shifting to Situational) holds firmly through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is not just a backdrop but the active interface of the story, responding to the protagonist's rhythm with specific sensory details like "petals that shivered like thoughts." The integration of the "auric lagoon" into the plot mechanics (lifting the sheet of gold) is seamless and imaginative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established: the risk of the "experimental treatment" versus the loss of Jonah. The escalation is handled well via the system's "pulse warning" which forces an explicit moment of consent and deeper commitment. The cost is felt in the "ache of auroral sorrow" and the acknowledged blurring of the protagonist's outline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of shared memory requiring a surrender of individual boundaries is beautifully explored. The story avoids a tidy "cure" ending, instead opting for a complex thematic resolution where connection requires a permanent alteration of the self. The final image of carrying sorrow "like a lantern" perfectly encapsulates this.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and highly attuned to the central metaphor of sound and vibration. The prose rhythm mimics the drumming method, creating a strong unity between style and subject. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the sci-fi elements through a deeply personal, emotional lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is high, with inventive imagery like "drones drifted like drowsy moths" and "dryer clacking buttons like hail." The sensory details ("metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea") are vivid. A slight deduction for the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly rebellious," "hush of the universe") which momentarily exposes the scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The concept of a sonic garden as a neural interface for comatose patients is fresh and executed with specific, non-generic details. The use of rhythm/drumming as the bridge between minds avoids the standard "telepathy" tropes, offering a more tactile and grounded approach to the premise.</comment>
