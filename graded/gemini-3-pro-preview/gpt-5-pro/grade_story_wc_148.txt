<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s burden—his father’s "cry wolf" legacy—is dramatized with distinct interiority, driving a compelling emotional arc. The choice to reject "alarms" for "work" is a well-earned renunciation that defines the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the method from panic to patient marking with clear conceptual cost. The dream logic holds together firmly under the Accumulative/Textural lens, earning the final insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral, not just atmospheric; the "lattice" and "lantern" function as essential tools that constrain and enable the protagonist’s interaction with the hush. The "drowned pantry" and "jagged reef" create a vivid, claustrophobic reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure builds consistently as the narrator descends into the prison, tightening the stakes between "lazy truth" and necessary work. While the antagonist (silence/belief) is abstract, the internal and thematic conflict creates sufficient narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A brilliant thematic inversion of the source material; the insight that people are eaten by "the ease of being believed" rather than wolves is profound. The ending resonates by reweighting the concept of warning into one of quiet, laborious proof.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is highly stylized and controls its lyric distance well, maintaining a consistent perceptual signature. The specific lexicon ("clockwork salt," "copperlight") reinforces the surreal, fable-like quality without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The unrelenting density of figurative language occasionally drifts into muddle (e.g., "history wipes on its teeth," "gulls hover like commas"). While evocative, the heavy metaphorical load slows momentum and risks overwriting in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An exceptionally original synthesis of prison noir and fairy tale mythos. The re-imagining of the "boy who cried wolf" sequel, combined with the "hush" as an active entity, feels fresh and inevitable.</comment>
