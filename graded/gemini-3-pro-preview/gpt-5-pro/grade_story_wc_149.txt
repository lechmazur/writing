<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is rich and consistent, grounding the fantastical elements in a palpable sense of duty and loss. While the protagonist's agency is somewhat reactive—following the ghost's instructions to resolve the plot—the emotional logic of the debt and the final acceptance of eternal service feels earned and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the narrator's relationship to the orchard shifts from technical tuning to relational atonement with a clear conceptual cost (endless payment). The "backstory download" via the bead is a slightly convenient mechanism, but the logic of the "ledger" holds the ending together well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is actively constraining and constitutive of the story's reality; the glass, the endless night, and the acoustic properties of the sap define the available actions. The environment acts as a crucible for the magic system, elevating the stakes beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently through the ghost's interventions, though the conflict is resolved primarily through compliance rather than a difficult active choice between competing goods or evils. The cost—a lifetime of service—is resonant, but the path to it lacks significant friction or missteps by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of debt as a living relationship rather than a transaction ("paid when you keep paying") is sophisticated and lands with emotional weight. The narrative resists a tidy "exorcism" ending in favor of a more complex, lingering entanglement that suits the tone perfectly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is generally distinct and lyrical, but suffers from significant register breaks caused by forced prompt integration. Phrases like "ephemeral cameo appearances" and "quick edits of my breath" introduce cinematic/technical diction that clashes jarringly with the established mythic/alchemical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative ("sap remembered thunder"), with high information density and strong rhythm. However, the score is capped by the register artifacts mentioned in Q6 and some reliance on telling via adverbs ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation") that disrupt the otherwise high-quality textural work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, sound, and agriculture creates a fresh and compelling aesthetic. While the "ghost bride" is a familiar trope, the specific mechanics of the "stringed flasks" and the acoustic magic system offer a genuinely original angle on the concept of haunting.</comment>
