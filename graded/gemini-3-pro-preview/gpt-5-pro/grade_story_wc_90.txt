<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's pacifism is not merely a trait but a hard constraint that forces the rejection of the warhead solution, directly shaping the plot. The internal conflict between "weight" (grief) and the need for levity is dramatized effectively through the gravity mechanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the "quilted" ship image successfully transforms the initial "patchwork" state. The progression from the "warhead" refusal to the "shadow work" breakthrough is causal and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ship's "braided artificial gravity" responding to emotion is an exceptional micro-setting rule that constrains movement and dictates tactics (reaching the shaft). The environment is active, resisting and yielding to the protagonist's specific method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stakes are braided tightly between the internal (grief/weight) and external (the locked door/child's safety). The refusal to use force acts as a decisive escalation that raises the cost, requiring the physical sacrifice of the "pricked thumb."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of healing through "stitching" rather than conquering integrates perfectly with the narrative mechanics. The final image of the "quilted" ship beautifully resolves the "scraps of failed utopias" motif without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and meditative, perfectly suiting the "ghostly resolve" tone. The high-poetic register remains controlled, though it occasionally risks distancing the reader from the immediate physical struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no scaffold. A few metaphors ("throat learning the first vowel," "reality yield like skin") border on mixed or overwrought, but the rhythmic control is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a literalized emotional mechanic (gravity=joy) with a salvage-punk aesthetic creates a fresh narrative logic. The concept of "stitching" reality as a pacifist alternative to "breaking" a dimension is genuinely ingenious.</comment>
