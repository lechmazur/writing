<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator is compellingly competent, with weariness and expertise that anchor the scene's emotional logic. Motivation is clearly dramatized through the act of decoding, though the "lotus-hearted" internal label feels slightly precious compared to the grit of the task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The linear arc is tightly constructed, moving from the initial problem to a decisive resolution earned via the protagonist's specific skills. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the conflict, sealed effectively by the graft metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and immersive, with the hospital's twilight atmosphere mirroring the "mist" of the conflict. The boy's cast serves as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains the puzzle and drives the plot forward.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high ("kin" vs "proof"), and the tension escalates naturally as the factions wait outside. The resolution feels earned, though the "softening" of the conflict agents happens perhaps a beat too smoothly given the established danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of translation as healing/grafting is powerfully woven through the imagery of the cast and coral. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thesis ("translation is not a bridge but a graft"), which diminishes the subtextual power of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, successfully blending the technical (medical/translation) with the atmospheric. The register holds steady, though the high density of metaphor occasionally threatens to distance the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished and rhythmically controlled, but the density of figurative language is relentless ("fog stitched," "windows breathe," "tide turned vowels"). While beautiful, this saturation in nearly every sentence slightly drags on the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of decoding a child's cast to resolve a conflict-zone custody dispute is fresh and ingeniously executed. The synthesis of the "pacific" setting with the medical/translation task creates a unique narrative space.</comment>
