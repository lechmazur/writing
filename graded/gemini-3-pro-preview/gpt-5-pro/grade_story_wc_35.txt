<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is a highly competent, sensory-anchored focalizer whose internal landscape perfectly mirrors the magic system. The "cost" of the conflict is effectively embodied in physical reactions ("jaw clenched," "ached"), grounding the abstract concept of memory-tasting in visceral experience. Motivation is clear and professional, though the high competence slightly dampens the sense of personal risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear procedural structure (diagnosis, gathering, ritual, cure) that fits the length well. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration of the city's mood, validated by the castellan. While logical and satisfying, the progression feels somewhat inevitable, lacking a sharp causal turn or reversal to spike the tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, functioning as both atmosphere and constraint; the "coral icebound pavilion" and rain pools actively shape the plot and the magic's mechanics. Specific sensory details ("walls exhaled grit," "little mirrors") create a vivid, immersive world. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, meeting the high-band criteria.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily Man vs. Nature/Abstract (endurance against grief), handled with professional expertise. While the pressure escalates during the journey and the tasting of the "siege," the protagonist's mastery ensures a relatively smooth resolution without a moment of desperate doubt. The stakes are clear, but the lack of a costly tradeoff caps the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of communal metabolism of grief and the weight of memory are integrated organically into the action. The final "recipe" serves as a resonant thematic summary ("Bring what you cannot say") that lands well, even if it borders slightly on explicit moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "sturdy brittle" tone that matches the subject matter. The sensory metaphors ("mineral of omission") are sophisticated and voice-driven. The prose texture effectively supports the magical realism of the premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose density and imagery are generally high quality ("filigrees that remembered vanished seas"). However, the verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "emotionally contagious through touch" (likely a prompt requirement) disrupts the rhythm and reads as an artificial insertion, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of culinary magic with a surreal, geological memory system (coral in the desert) is fresh and evocative. The story transforms the "memory-eating" trope through specific, unexpected setting details, creating a unique aesthetic identity.</comment>
