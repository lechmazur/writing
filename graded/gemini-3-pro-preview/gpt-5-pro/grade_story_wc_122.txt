<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vividly rendered through sensory metaphor, grounding her deafness in tactile experience rather than deficit. Her motivation is clear and poignant, though her agency in the central climax is somewhat passive; she provides the tools, but Risto performs the transformative ritual. The shift from numbness to feeling feels earned by her willingness to engage rather than a hard decisional trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting need to a ritualistic transformation and a confirmatory final scene. The drive lens shifts from accumulative pressure in the cavern to a causal outcome in the classroom. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the drum bridges her internal change to her external practice, though the ending scene feels slightly like an epilogue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the drum maker's cavern acting as a resonant chamber that constrains and defines the magical logic. The sensory details ("stone breaths," "braille river") are strictly filtered through Lena's tactile perspective, creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere that directly charges the ritual and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are intimate and clear, but the escalation relies heavily on a guided ritual where the protagonist follows instructions rather than driving the action through difficult choices. The "cost" is the surrender of the needle and the protective numbness, which is emotionally legible but lacks a sharp, dramatized price on the page. The conflict is resolved smoothly, lacking gritty opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The themes of grief, silence, and resonance are beautifully woven into the imagery and plot. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("Together they learned the lesson quiet offers..."), which triggers the penalty for moralizing/sermonizing endings. Without this didactic capstone, the thematic resonance would be much higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical intensity that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The prose texture effectively mimics the protagonist's sensory world, blending sound and touch. The shift to the classroom maintains this voice without breaking the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong but incredibly dense with figurative language ("stone breaths," "timid bird," "candle deciding to be fire"), occasionally bordering on overwriting. The required phrase "audibly muted" is used twice and feels slightly oxymoronic and clunky in a way that disrupts the otherwise smooth lyrical flow. The density of metaphor slows propulsion in places.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf protagonist, a specific magical craft (hush filament), and the concept of backward audio is fresh and imaginative. The story avoids generic "healing" tropes by grounding the magic in a specific, mechanical process (the phonograph needle on the drum). It feels like a unique modern fable.</comment>
