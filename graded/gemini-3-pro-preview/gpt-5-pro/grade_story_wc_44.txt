<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s voice is distinct, blending technical precision with lyrical interiority ("restless math," "apprenticed to dust"). The arc from a desire for mastery to a "patient" humility is earned through the interaction with the Archivist. The "missing edge" at the end serves as a subtle, embodied cost of the character's growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure is impeccable; the central inquiry drives the action linearly while the "model building" sequence serves as a perfect structural fractal of the theme (closing loops). Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to knowledge shifts from extraction to stewardship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but structural; the floating isle's altitude depends on the shadow mechanism, directly linking the environment to the stakes. Imagery like "glass blackened like burned tea" and "sun shear our darkness like a net" creates a vivid, consistent texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high (the stability of the isle), and the intellectual pressure is sustained. While the moral choice is foreshadowed early ("learn without taking"), the tension of the mystery and the weight of the revelation provide sufficient escalation to carry the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of "return" and "closing loops" is woven seamlessly into plot, action, and dialogue. The final realization—that shadows are teachers and progress isn't a shortcut—lands with profound conceptual weight, recontextualizing the entire inquiry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and highly specific, maintaining a consistent "rune scholar" register that feels authentic to the world. The control of psychic distance is excellent, moving from observational distance to intimate realization without jarring shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density; metaphors like "gears ratcheting like rain" serve the steampunk/fantasy aesthetic perfectly. There are no wasted lines or rhythmic loops; the text propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork mechanics with shadow-magic is fresh and specific. The concept of shadows as a buoyant fuel source that "relearns" the person is a genuinely inventive turn on light/dark tropes.</comment>
