<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ilya is drawn with precise, embodied interiority; the physical sensation of the "pocket of absence" grounds his grief in a tangible constraint. His motivation is clear and urgent, and the interaction with the crystallized voice feels earned rather than melodramatic. The choice to seek the deleted memory is well-supported by the backstory of the "licensed forgetting."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative logic follows a compelling surreal causality, moving from the omen (leaning flame) to the method (grounds) to the retrieval (salt) and release (whale). Closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration that alters the town’s state with legible conceptual cost. The "gravity pockets" serve as effective plot devices that guide the protagonist's movement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "salt crystal growing chamber" is an exceptional setting that actively constrains the protagonist—he must wait for the gravity pocket to pass before acting. Sensory details are vivid and specific ("air that tastes of iron rain," "unfinished bells"), grounding the magical realism in physical texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conflict between civic "mercy" (erasure) and personal ache drives the narrative efficiently. The external pressure of the gravity pockets effectively physicalizes the stakes, tightening the tension in the crystal chamber scene where the environment threatens to crush the memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a natural force that resists industrial sanitization is developed through concrete imagery rather than abstraction. The resolution—where the sea and salt "pay in echoes" rather than receipts—offers a poignant, non-moralizing answer to the premise of licensed forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical intensity that suits the dream-like logic of the world. The shift from the technical description of the salt chamber to the emotional resonance of the voice in the cube is handled with smooth control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and highly evocative, with high information density in lines like "geometry hatch from water" and "air combed by linen." The imagery is fresh and purposeful, avoiding scaffold loops; the rhythm supports the building tension without becoming monotonous.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements is remarkably fresh; the concept of a salt chamber growing memories and a whale acting as a vestibule for forgotten thunder creates a unique cosmology. The transformation of the "lantern lighter" trope into a navigator of gravity and memory feels genuinely inventive.</comment>
