<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is vivid, balancing the "intimately aloof" persona with genuine vulnerability ("hands shook"). The motivation (a deadline driven by the broken mirror) is compelling and idiosyncratic. A slight reliance on label-like self-definition ("I preferred intimately aloof") prevents a higher score, though the character consistently embodies this trait through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the inciting crack to the cave ritual and back with clear causality. Closure is achieved via Resonant Reconfiguration; the release of the shell and the acceptance of the "stranger" reflection mark a decisive internal shift. The "wrong turn" beat feels slightly convenient (reliant on a suddenly recalled rumor), but the structural integrity remains strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a standout strength. The cave environment is rendered with tactile precision ("sleeping fire," "green light like fishscale"), and the lighting serves as an effective natural clock. The setting actively pressures the protagonist's process, elevating it beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing time/keeping the promise) is clear, and the tension escalates effectively as the light ("silver hair") thins. The cost is paid on the page through the sacrifice of the shell—a sentimental object linked to the mother. The conflict remains internal and conceptual, but the physical constraints of the tide and light give it sufficient weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of "temporary eternity" is central, but its execution in the final paragraph is overly explicit. Writing the phrase on the canvas and explaining "that was the point" articulates the thesis directly, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. This explanatory coda diffuses the resonance built by the earlier, more subtle image of the shell spinning in the pool.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, matching the "nostalgic quay painter" persona. Phrasing like "contradiction I wore like salt" establishes a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative distance is well-managed, maintaining intimacy without over-explaining the surreal elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("spidered from my forehead," "took the wrongness by the sleeve"). Rhythm is well-calibrated to the contemplative pacing. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the imagery aligns with the marine/painterly lexicon throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of an artist seeking to capture time in a hidden place is a familiar trope, but the specific details (the mirror deadline, the shell as a teacher) add freshness. The "stranger" in the reflection offers a nuanced twist on the self-discovery arc, elevating the resolution.</comment>
