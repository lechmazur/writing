<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc from seeking an ending to postponing it is well-motivated and tracked through specific internal shifts. The "grips reality loosely" trait is effectively dramatized by the choice to volunteer, grounding the abstract desire in concrete action. The interaction with Mikko serves as a strong catalyst for the internal change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative structure successfully bridges the "euthanasia tourist" premise with the "disaster relief" action, creating a coherent hybrid drive. Closure is decisive and earned; the choice to "postpone" lands with visible emotional cost and thematic resonance, effectively reconfiguring the protagonist's stance toward time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is rendered with high specificity, acting as a dynamic force that constrains movement and forces the climax (the ice split). While the sensory details are vivid, the reliance on simile to describe the setting occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high (life vs. death), with the waiting period providing a natural pressure cooker. The climax—saving the boy from the ice—is a functional if slightly convenient escalation that externalizes the stakes, forcing the protagonist to confront the nature of "approaching endings" directly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "learning endings" is explored with nuance, avoiding simple answers in favor of a "fold in patience." The subtext of disaster relief as a rehearsal for one's own end is powerful and well-integrated, though the internal monologue occasionally teeters on didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, melancholic, and consistent, but it suffers from a repetitive rhythmic cadence caused by the overuse of simile structures (capped by Q7). The persona is well-defined, but the relentless poeticizing sometimes flattens the emotional urgency of the disaster relief work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is severely hampered by "simile churn"—there are over 15 "like" comparisons in a short text ("like a breath," "like a metronome," "like confetti," "like slow animals," etc.). This creates a distractingly repetitive template cadence that muffles the story's otherwise strong imagery and reduces line-level momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of euthanasia tourism and disaster relief is a genuinely fresh and compelling premise. The story transforms these elements into a unique meditation on control and surrender, offering a specific, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable by the end.</comment>
