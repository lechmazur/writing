<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aurel's internal landscape is rich ("hive of second thoughts"), but the reconciliation with Ferro and Miri lacks interpersonal friction; their immediate compliance lowers the scene's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal arc from realization to experimental performance is solid, and the closure effectively reconfigures the setting. The transition to the bar is handled efficiently within the short scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radar dome is masterfully integrated, functioning as both atmospheric container and thematic resonance ("patient auditorium"). Sensory details like "pencil scratches" and "fossils" are vivid and precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes of ethical responsibility are clear, but the external obstacles—the troupe's return and the drunk's interruption—are overcome with relatively low resistance, dampening the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of power and consent in art is articulated with nuance, avoiding simplistic moralizing. The final image of the internal dome successfully reprices the protagonist's understanding of silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and polished, maintaining a consistent lyrical texture that suits the "urbane calligrapher" persona. Interiority and description blend seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and evocative ("trembled like an artery," "bruise legible") with excellent rhythmic control. The writing avoids artifacts and maintains momentum throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of bunraku, calligraphy, and the radar dome setting creates a unique aesthetic. The concept of "reverse writing" to signify ethical withdrawal is a fresh, specific invention.</comment>
