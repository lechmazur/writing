<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal logic is meticulously rendered, with the "visibility" motive driving a high-stakes choice to shed safety at the climax. The transition from observer to participant is earned through specific actions (repairing the tape) and culminates in a decisive physical revelation that carries unmistakable cost to their anonymity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight and unbroken; the outage prompts the work, the work prompts the trap, and the trap forces the encounter. Closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's relationship to the setting and Mara is irreversibly altered, satisfying the prompt's high-band requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is not just atmospheric but functional; the atlas case and pipe chases actively constrain and enable the protagonist's tactics. Sensory details like the "chalky plaster" and "brass" creates a tactile, lived-in environment that grounds the lyrical voice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate but sharply defined; the tension between the desire to comfort and the safety of invisibility escalates naturally. The climax forces a trade-off where the protagonist creates a moment of connection at the expense of their protective secrecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "visibility as offering" is woven organically into the plot mechanics rather than stated as a moral. The ending resonates powerfully, answering the central question of grief with a concrete act of presence without descending into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a "shy architecture" persona with consistent rhythm and perceptual bias. The shift from internal observation to direct address ("I am not a ghost") is handled with excellent control of psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("voice the exact grade of paper"), though the repetition of "hush" in paragraph 4 and the density of metaphors ("glass turning to water") slightly crowd the reading line. The mechanics of the tape repair are described with pleasing precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the "hidden dweller" trope with a tender, restorative purpose that avoids cliché horror or whimsy. The execution feels fresh, particularly in how the technical details of the library archive are used to bridge the emotional gap.</comment>
