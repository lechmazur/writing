<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator is a compelling, mythic presence with a highly distinct voice, serving as a stable anchor for the fable. However, the character lacks internal friction or contradictory impulses; they function as a competent, unwavering vessel for the theme rather than a conflicted protagonist. The "coachman" persona is consistent, but the emotional cost is observed rather than struggled through internally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric structure is robust, teaching the "nature-as-grammar" logic effectively before applying it to the veteran's specific wound. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the interaction with the veteran solidifies the "submerged concord." The drive is Accumulative, building density until the final image of the "narrow vastness" ferries the reader out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting utilization is exceptional; the bird calls do not merely flavor the scene but strictly constrain the narrator's actions ("Tern says iron here... I set a pod where the tern taps"). The environment is the primary antagonist and toolset, intricately mapped through the sensory lens of the protagonist. The details (fenders of hibiscus, rusty formations) create a vivid, surreal geography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The external pressure of the "war keeping marching in long salt" is established well, and the arrival of the veteran provides a necessary focal point for the stakes. However, the resolution is relatively low-cost; the seed pod functions as a magical cure that "fells him to quiet tears" instantly, bypassing a grittier struggle or trade-off in that moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing through a new "grammar" of nature is tightly woven into every action and image. The story resists a simple "nature wins" moral by acknowledging the "buried iron" and "submerged concord" that must be integrated, not just covered. The ending resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of post-war restoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is hypnotic, confident, and texturally distinct, maintaining a "dead port-argot" flavor throughout. The POV remains stable and authoritative, fitting the "coachman" archetype. The distance is managed well, allowing the surreal elements to feel grounded in the narrator's specific expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is lush and rhythmic ("wheels sainted with pollen"), showing high technical skill. However, the central conceit of nature-as-language (paragraphs, rosaries, syllable, sentence, dead languages, grammar, vows, ledger, psalm, annotates) is so relentless that it risks becoming a repetitive texture loop by the final third, slightly suffocating the scene's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a coachman gardening a jetty using bird calls to map buried war-metal is strikingly original. The synthesis of gardening and linguistics creates a fresh, melancholic angle on the "post-war healing" trope, elevating it beyond standard genre conventions.</comment>
