<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The narrator is passive, serving primarily as a camera for the researcher's lesson without meaningful internal conflict or difficult choices. The researcher functions as an archetype rather than a fully realized character, with emotions described generically ("smile wavered") rather than embodied in complex action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Situational drive, using the lesson to structure the scene effectively. Closure lands cleanly with the researcher's disappearance, fulfilling the "Conceptual Repricing" requirement where the lesson's cost is the teacher's existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail is strong, with the magnetic grotto and iron sand actively participating in the narrative logic rather than just serving as a backdrop. The specific interaction of the setting with the plot (sand writing messages) adds distinct texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Pressure is derived from the timeline of the researcher's regression, creating a coherent situational stakes. However, the conflict remains abstract and intellectual; the narrator faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely observing the inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue and literally written in the sand ("Stay only as long as you matter to the pattern"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This overt moralizing prevents the subtext from resonating organically and triggers the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, though it leans into a solemn, instructional tone that lacks variation. Narrative distance is stable, but the dialogue feels stylized to the point of artificiality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("like listeners," "like unwrinkled paper," "like a book") that clutter the imagery. The repetition of "sycamore hush" as a bookend feels forced rather than rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The piece executes a standard "zen master" fable structure competently but offers little structural or conceptual innovation. The core reversal—effect without cause—is a classic trope handled predictably.</comment>
