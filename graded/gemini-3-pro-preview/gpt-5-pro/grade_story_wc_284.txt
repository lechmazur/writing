<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal state is well-rendered, with the "burned" status creating a credible constraint on their actions. The shift from caution to the risk of the "apology" code demonstrates clear agency and character change. Motivation is consistent, though the phrasing "unused courage" leans slightly into diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and causal; the protagonist's preparation directly enables the meeting and the resolution. The "engraving map becoming the inventory" is a clever pivot that ties the beginning to the end. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the radio's repair serving as a tangible proof of the internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and functional, with the mist and snow exerting pressure on the meeting. The pillbox is an excellent use of a micro-setting/object that constrains choice (the code) and charges the final image (the repair). Sensory details like "sifted salt" and "silver hush" establish a cohesive noir tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—reconnection versus exposure—and the pressure escalates appropriately with the stranger's arrival. The turning point relies on a specific choice (the apology/fourth line) rather than coincidence. The cost is felt in the risk taken, though the external threat remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of restoration is well-integrated into the action of fixing the radio. However, the explicit statement that "fixing what's broken is... a way of walking back into yourself" acts as a Thematic Echo, articulating the thesis too directly and reducing the interpretative depth. The resonance at the end is stronger than the setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical noir quality that suits the genre and character. The transition from internal monologue to dialogue is smooth. The contact's voice is distinct enough from the narrator's, though the dialogue Vouchsafe feels slightly artificial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished and high-density, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, some metaphors border on strained or overwrought (e.g., "smiled like a bruise remembering its color," "sun had not yet learned to linger"), which momentarily draws attention away from the scene to the writing itself.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story executes the "burned spy" trope with competence and specific, fresh details like the fern code and the pillbox inventory. While the core premise is familiar, the synthesis of the object and the resolution offers a satisfying, non-generic angle.</comment>
