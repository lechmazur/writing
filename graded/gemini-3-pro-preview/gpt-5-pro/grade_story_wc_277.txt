<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinct, blending her heritage ("newsprint heiress") with her current agency ("janitor" of truth) effectively. The internal motivation is clear and drives the action, though the characterization of Kline feels slightly thin, serving more as a foil for her wit than a fully resistant antagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The structure is robust, moving cleanly from the inciting call through the investigation to a decisive confrontation. The closure—a drafted statement and a return call—is a clear Decisive Change with the legible cost of lost prestige ("reduce our shine").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory is atmospheric, and the use of specific tools (calibration lamp, histogram) grounds the scene nicely. However, the reliance on abstract simile ("dome exhales echoes as if the sky were a hollow cello") occasionally distances the reader from the physical reality of the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (truth vs. donor satisfaction) and escalate through the attempt to delete the logs. The resolution relies heavily on a rhetorical victory ("monologue wins the day") rather than a grind of competing pressures, making the antagonist's surrender feel slightly too rapid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of truth requiring a "correction" is woven beautifully into the protagonist's identity and the astronomical setting. The concept of "proof by contradiction" serves as an excellent thematic and structural bridge between the scientific and journalistic worlds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the "heiress" persona. However, the dialogue often mirrors the narration's heavy metaphorical density ("graphs look back like children"), causing the characters to sound rhetorically identical rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece suffers from significant overwriting and metaphor density, violating the rubric's density check. Phrases like "smells like inked thunder" and "floor hums like a printing press" appear in nearly every sentence, clogging the pacing and obscuring the action with decorative scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of journalism ethics and astronomical data integrity is fresh and handled with ingenuity. The "proof by contradiction" frame adds a unique intellectual layer to the standard "stop the fraud" plot.</comment>
