<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator is defined primarily by their role and self-description ("listening without flinching") rather than deep internal contradiction. While the intervention with Daro demonstrates agency, the explicit self-labeling ("uncommonly thoughtful") feels expository, and the narrator's competence renders the central conflict somewhat safe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ritualistic structure is solid, creating a clear container for the action with a legible micro-turn involving the prisoner Daro. Closure is achieved through a resonant return to stasis, though the resolution to the standoff—pointing to a ledger—feels slightly convenient given the established tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric grounding is strong; the "mist," "watch niche," and "pale metronome" of the moon effectively constrain the scene. The setting actively pressures the characters, forcing the "furrowed hush" that dictates the pacing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated (peace vs. war), but the ritualistic nature of the exchange dampens visceral pressure until Daro's refusal. The escalation is functional, but the protagonist resolves the peak conflict with low-cost social authority rather than a painful trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of neutrality as a heavy, active burden is cohesive and well-supported by the "ledger of griefs." However, the refrain "between apology and forgiveness" and the explicit promise to "recycle mistakes" lean toward moralizing, telling the reader the theme rather than letting it emerge solely from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The meditative, slightly formal voice fits the fable-like quality of the story ("tongue and the heart argue"). Narrative distance is stable, though the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama, distancing the reader from the immediate grit of the exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is evocative ("cold as gull bone"), but the mandatory repetition of full prompt phrases (e.g., "antique drawer pull" four times) creates a noticeable rhythmic drag and artifact effect. Information density is generally good, but the "furrowed hush" bookends feel slightly staged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A cohesive blend of diplomatic procedural and ritualistic fantasy. While the "bridge exchange" trope is familiar, the integration of moon phases and the ledger gives it a distinct, if somewhat safe, specific flavor.</comment>
