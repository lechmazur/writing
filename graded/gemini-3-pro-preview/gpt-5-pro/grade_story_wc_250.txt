<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by a compelling, distinct constraints-based persona ("silent canal guardian") that drives every interaction. The vow of silence is not merely a quirk but a functional tool that shapes the rescue, creating a unique form of agency. The interplay between the guardian's internal discipline ("work is simple to say and difficult to practice") and the external crisis is excellent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative operates under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens, where the ritual of light and shutters builds the necessary pressure to effect the rescue. The causality follows a coherent "fable logic" established in the first paragraph. Closure is achieved through a resonant return to stasis, with the mirror pocketed and the "ripple... return[ing]," marking a completed cycle of vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the action; the dock, the shutters, and the dark water are not just backdrop but the instruments of the protagonist's trade. The specific sensory details—"cobalt dock," "wet grain," "warm light of the harbor lamp"—constrain the available tactics and ground the mythical tone in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are immediate and high (a drowning brother), managed with a controlled "stillwater tension" that fits the voice perfectly. While the external opposition is elemental (water/darkness) rather than antagonistic, the pressure on the guardian to execute the rescue without breaking the vow maintains taut narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of silent instruction—teaching "darkness the value of stars"—is masterfully woven into the mechanics of the plot. The resolution does not preach but demonstrates the premise through the physical action of the mirror and shutters, achieving a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptional—distinct, lyrical, and authoritative, with a perceptual signature that consistently filters the world through the lens of light and water. The control of psychic distance is precise, maintaining the mythical detachment of the guardian while allowing for genuine empathy with the boys.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmic, sustaining a high level of craft. A few metaphors border on the ornate ("face rose like a moon that had forgotten its own brightness"), but they generally serve the atmospheric consistency. The text avoids scaffold and maintains strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of specific, disparate elements—a dental mirror, boathouse shutters, and a vow of silence—creates a highly original and memorable protagonist. The story feels fresh and specifically imagined, transforming a rescue trope into a unique ritual.</comment>
