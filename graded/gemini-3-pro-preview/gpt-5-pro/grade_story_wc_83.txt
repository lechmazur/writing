<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s identity as a survivor is not merely backstory but the causal engine of the climax; the refusal to mine the site proceeds directly from their history of being a target. Internal conflict is palpable, balancing the need for purpose ("keeps me from unraveling") against the moral cost of the discovery. The choice to lock the coordinates is a character-specific exertion of agency that feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is definitive and resonant; the refusal to extract the "potential" functions as a Decisive Change that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the institution and their own trauma. The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from the hunt's setup to the discovery and the subsequent moral stance. The cost—institutional backlash and the forfeiture of a breakthrough—is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory is rendered with specific, tactile details ("creaks like a cathedral lantern," "taste iron") that ground the metaphysical concepts in physical space. The environment actively constrains the characters, from the cooling fans dictating the rhythm to the salt flats acting as a silent witness. The integration of the technical (interferometer) and the personal (geode) creates a cohesive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between institutional extraction and personal sanctity; the escalation comes not from external action but from the realization of what the "minima" represents. The pressure holds under a Situational lens, forcing a crystallization of the protagonist's stance. The cost is felt in the final rejection of the "miracle" the board demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of trauma as a resource versus a site of reverence is handled with sophistication, avoiding simple binaries. The concept of "unused potential" serves as a powerful metaphor for the lives unlived due to violence, resonating strongly with the protagonist's backstory. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central thematic question without resorting to moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, carrying a poetic weight that suits the subject matter without becoming detached. The shift from the technical language of the hunt to the visceral language of memory ("rice falling like snow") is handled smoothly. The first-person perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the world consistently through the lens of a survivor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm ("unwilling to be a weapon"). However, the metaphor density is very high ("maps fade like phosphors after a kiss," "dragonflies trapped"), which occasionally threatens to overcrowd the high-pressure beats. A minor capitalization slip ("Intangibly tangible") slightly mars the polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of using physics instrumentation to map the "topography of might have been" is highly original and executes a fresh synthesis of sci-fi and war trauma. The transformation of the "hunt" trope into a search for metaphysical counterfactuals feels innovative. The story commits fully to its unique internal logic.</comment>
