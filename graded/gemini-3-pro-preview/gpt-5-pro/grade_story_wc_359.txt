<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist serves as a functional vessel for the magic system rather than a fully realized character with grounded agency. The motivation ("certify wonder") is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or internal contradiction. The "danger" of sleep is navigated without visible struggle or hesitation, resulting in a competence-heavy performance that lacks human vulnerability or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic structure where the "field test" frame provides a clear goal but lacks causal friction. The synchronization with the sculptor proceeds smoothly, and the central obstacle is overcome instantly ("I stepped where green asked") without complication. Closure arrives as a completed task (Earned Stasis) rather than a decisive turn with felt consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, grounding the abstract magic system in concrete details like the "amber music sheet" and "thin ice." The spatial relationship between the cavern and the city above is established effectively, creating a strong atmospheric link between the two worlds. The environment actively shapes the ritual, fulfilling the prompt's requirements for setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes are declared as high ("world from shattering") but remain abstract and are never tested by a credible threat in the scene. The "council" is an off-stage pressure, and the "danger" of sleep is dispelled with a single action, lacking the escalation or cost required for higher marks. The protagonist succeeds without a moment of genuine doubt, lowering the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of invisible labor supporting artistic creation is coherent but executed with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements ("certify wonder as essential") rather than subtext. The concept of "sculpted hush" is poetic, but the story asserts its importance rather than dramatizing the consequences of its absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the high-fantasy tone with a lyrical rhythm. However, the high psychic distance and reliance on personification ("mallet dreamt," "canvas tarp inhaled") create a barrier to emotional intimacy. The "we" of the council and the formal register distance the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten and suffers from a high density of "X of Y" genitive metaphors ("finger bone of light," "fossil of song," "lantern of dust," "ribbons of light," "cat of light"). This prepositional pile-up creates a monotonous texture and occasionally obscures clarity (e.g., whether the "finger bone" is a literal object or a light beam). The imagery is beautiful in isolation but cloying in aggregate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise of a subterranean mage engaging in synesthetic work to stabilize surface-world art is imaginative and offers a fresh take on the muse archetype. While the specific imagery is original, the lack of grit or narrative resistance makes the ingenuity feel somewhat ornamental and safe.</comment>
