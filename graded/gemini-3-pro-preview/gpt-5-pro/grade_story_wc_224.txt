<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation to redefine "home" is clear and drives the narrative, but the emotional landscape relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("smothered with busyness") rather than visceral, embodied experience. While the internal shift—from seeking a place to claiming a practice—is distinct, the character functions more as a vessel for the lyrical imagery than a fully fleshed presence. The transaction with the Seer effectively dramatizes the internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, moving coherently from the inciting ascent through the ritual of the labyrinth to a decisive conceptual repricing at the rotunda. The closure is strong, using the "seed of breath" to anchor the abstract realization that home is a practice. The dream logic holds consistently, though the "time" aspect remains somewhat loose until the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and active, physically reacting to the protagonist ("reformats me," "mountain reshapes"). Specific sensory details like the "smell of glue, ash, and rain" and the "floor is an atlas" ground the surrealism effectively. The environment successfully constrains the character’s choices, forcing the specific method of reading the stone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate steadily as the protagonist moves deeper into the mountain, facing the danger of the stone ("meaning bites") and the cost of the key. The pressure remains coherent under an accumulative lens, leading to a necessary trade-off (past identity for present breath). The conflict is resolved through a clear agency-driven action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central theme of home as a "practice" rather than an "address" is resonant and well-developed through the stone and feather motifs. However, the story articulates this thesis explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("home is not an address but a practice"), which slightly deflates the tension by explaining the realization rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately lyrical for the magical realism genre. However, the relentless high-poetic register ("sleeve of a twilight he wears," "air weeps with hidden thunder") occasionally draws attention away from the narrative substance. The consistency is high, but the textural variance is low.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from a high density of similes and personification ("like silvered mirrors," "like a choir," "like handwriting," "like lanterns," "like a coin"), creating a repetitive syntactic rhythm that feels overwrought. While individual images are evocative, the cumulative effect is a "scaffold" of figurative language that distances the reader from the immediate action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "labyrinthine bookstore" trope with the specific mechanics of the mercury seer and the language stone feels fresh. The conceptual turn—reading via texture to avoid the "bite" of meaning—is an inventive solution that elevates the standard "quest for home" narrative.</comment>
