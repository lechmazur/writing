<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and lyrical, but the "skeptic" trait feels nominal; he accepts magical elements (sap maps, hedge breath) with the instant fluidity of a believer, undermining the internal conflict. The motive to redeem his past error is clear, but the "shrewdly innocent" tag applied to both child characters feels repetitive rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The structure is a clean, linear fable with legible closure that resolves the central mystery. However, the progression relies on convenient, frictionless magical discovery ("Mara... knew exactly which leaf to lift") rather than causal struggle, making the sequence feel somewhat inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, texture-heavy details like the "pear tree stitched with moths" and the "husk-boy." The garden feels tangible and magical, grounding the fable logic in specific sensory experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly articulated (restoring the boy/atoning for doubt), but the escalation lacks teeth; the protagonist faces no significant resistance or cost in the garden. The climax—healing the fox—is a beautiful image but resolves the conflict with immediate ease, bypassing the "skeptic" friction entirely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of healing and listening is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the finale ("adults forgot how to listen") to land its point. This sermonizing undercut transforms a resonant fable into a didactic lesson, reducing the emotional impact of the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyrical, fable-like voice is consistent and confident, effectively blurring the line between medicine and magic. However, the high register occasionally drifts into self-conscious poetics ("doubt walks beside my hope like mismatched twins") that draw attention to the writing rather than the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich, though it occasionally tilts into purple territory ("patient than mud drying in balance"). The density of metaphor sometimes slows momentum, but the mechanics of the "bone setting" scenes are rendered with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bonesetter procedural with changeling mythology is fresh and engaging. However, the resolution relies on the familiar "children see what adults cannot" trope, which feels less inventive than the setup promised.</comment>
