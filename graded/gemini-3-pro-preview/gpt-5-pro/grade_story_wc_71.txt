<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is distinct and lyrical, establishing a consistent voice and worldview ("houses are conversations"). However, the prompt-mandated label "creeping normality noticer" reads as awkward exposition rather than a natural identity, and the emotional stakes—while poetic—lack the visceral friction or embodied cost required for higher bands. The protagonist functions more as a vessel for the ritual than a character under genuine pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story operates well as an atmospheric vignette under an Accumulative lens, with a clear beginning and end. However, the narrative arc is flat; the ritual proceeds without complication or unexpected resistance, leading to a "soft" resolution (an agreement of company) that feels aesthetically pleasing but structurally low-cost. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration, but the lack of a decisive turn or obstacle limits its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is the piece's strongest asset; the house is rendered with precise, lived-in details like the "sunmark" and the "worry in one leg" of the chair. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's actions and dictates the flow of the ritual, integrating setting with plot beautifully. The "bottles the color of weak tea" containing weather is a standout, high-specificity image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the house "waits" and the narrator acts, but there is no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The stakes are purely abstract (alignment vs. silence), and while the "hush" acts as a presence, it never threatens the protagonist's goal or forces a difficult trade-off. The story relies on mood rather than tension to sustain interest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thematic exploration of memory, presence, and the "conversations" houses hold is poignant and well-developed through the physical objects. The ending achieves a nice resonance about shared loneliness. However, the theme is occasionally over-articulated in reflective passages ("It occurs to me that houses are conversations...") rather than being left fully to subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The first-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably hushed, matching the story's content. The poetic register is maintained throughout without slipping into mundane exposition, though it occasionally borders on preciousness. The perspective focuses correctly on the sensory details relevant to the character's unique vocation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery ("salt wicks," "matte and pale as ground moon"). However, prompt collision causes lexical repetition of "hush" (hushed blaze, shard of hush, hush in the vial), and the personification "streetlights daydream" feels slightly twee and repetitive as a bookend. The label "creeping normality noticer" is a clunky artifact that disrupts the otherwise smooth syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "house tuner" with specific, grounded magical objects (orris root, captured weather) is fresh and imaginative. The concept avoids generic ghost-hunter tropes in favor of a more subtle, ambient magic system that feels original and distinct. The "weather collecting" element adds a layer of whimsy that elevates the premise.</comment>
