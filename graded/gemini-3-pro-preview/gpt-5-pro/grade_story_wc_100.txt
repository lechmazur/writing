<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The "weary undertaker" voice is established instantly and serves as a perfect anchor for the fable-like tone. While the protagonist's internal landscape is rich, the specific attribute "inadvertently stubborn" is told rather than dramatized, and the sudden manifestation of the "occupying" ability at the climax feels more like a convenient magic system reveal than a grounded character trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain from the package's arrival to the library descent is tight and imaginative. However, the resolution relies on a Deus Ex Machina ("the old undertaker's trick of occupying impossible spaces") that is introduced only at the moment it is needed to solve the central physical problem, bypassing the established constraints without prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater library is rendered with exceptional vividness ("arches ribbed with coral," "stacks of marble and silt"), transforming the setting into an active pressure on the narrative. The environment is not just a backdrop but a participant that forces the protagonist's realization about the "bottleneck" of grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative builds coherent pressure through the "tapping" of the lens and the "distress signals," creating a palpable sense of urgency. The closure lands a strong Conceptual Repricing—trading the undertaker's anonymity for a "permanent address" in the city's memory—though the physical cost is mitigated by the sudden magical resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The thematic integration of grief as a cataloging problem is profound and beautifully executed. The ending resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the central question of how to "shelve" sorrow, elevating the story beyond a simple fantasy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, maintaining a cohesive fable atmosphere throughout. The shift from the mundane shop to the surreal underwater library is handled with excellent distance control, keeping the reader grounded in the protagonist's perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is high-density and evocative, but suffers from a heavy reliance on simile scaffolding ("like folded velvet," "like fingernails," "like an old librarian," "like a shawl"). This repetitive syntactic pattern creates a slight drag on momentum during high-pressure beats, momentarily favoring decoration over propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of the lighthouse, undertaker, and underwater library tropes creates a genuinely fresh narrative space. The concept of the "ledger of quiet" and the inversion of the lighthouse lens from warning to welcoming demonstrates high conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
