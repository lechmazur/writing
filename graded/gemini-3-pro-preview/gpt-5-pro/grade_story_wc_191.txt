<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris is a distinct, voice-driven protagonist with a clear role and motivation grounded in heritage. While her competence is satisfying, the internal conflict remains mild; the choice to accept stewardship feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, lacking a moment of severe doubt or contradictory impulse that would heighten the character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, linear trajectory from the inciting assignment to the resonant closure of stewardship. The pacing is steady, and the transition from the orchard to the ascent is managed well. The resolution lands firmly as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the progression feels slightly frictionless, with tools and environments yielding readily to the protagonist's expertise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and functional, satisfying the 9+ requirement where the environment (murals, root-room) directly constrains tactics and guides the path. The "radio made of rain" and "falling windows" create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere that serves both plot and theme without becoming static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes (algorithms vs. human stewardship) and the time limit (sunrise) provide clear external pressure. However, the escalation is linear and somewhat low-resistance; the obstacles (finding the path, climbing) are overcome with immediate competence, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a reversal that truly endangers the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of stewardship as "listening" rather than ruling is beautifully integrated into the imagery and action. The ending resonates deeply, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of authority, avoiding overt moralizing while delivering a clear conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suited to a "lore keeper" of a surreal archive. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the world through Maris's specific nostalgic-futurist lens ("colors tasted like childhood circuitry") without wavering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and polished, with strong rhythmic control and evocative imagery ("lenses folding like origami"). While occasionally skirting the edge of purple ("spray ticked my skin with tiny static stars"), the style is purposeful and devoid of loop artifacts or scaffold sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-tech concepts (drones, algorithms) with mythic tropes (thrones, orchards, prophecy) feels fresh and specific. The reimagining of a throne as a "radio made of rain" is a striking, ingenious image that elevates the concept beyond standard genre fare.</comment>
