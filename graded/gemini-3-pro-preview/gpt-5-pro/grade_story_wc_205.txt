<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Neris’s "defunct" status actively informs the "kneeling" tactic, efficiently integrating backstory into immediate strategy. The internal shift from resignation to considering revolt provides a complete, subtle arc that earns the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is sturdy, with Neris’s specific calibration driving the reveal. The resolution relies slightly on a fortuitous parallel in the second vision (the council scene), but it lands with sufficient thematic weight to satisfy the closure requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of the "visible time" premise into physical constraints (covering mirrors to quiet the chorus). The setting acts as a force that dictates the mechanics of the climax, not just a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the gathering storm adds effective atmospheric pressure. The antagonist (Vark) functions primarily as a static foil, lacking sufficient independent agency to force a harder, more costly tradeoff from Neris.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recontextualization of "decadence" as an "ethics of attention" is a brilliant Conceptual Repricing that elevates the dispute. The ending resonates without summarizing, fulfilling the "reimagine" prompt with deep thematic integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "poetically inclined" voice is sustained without breaking character, matching the baroque density of the world. Narrative distance is controlled, allowing the high-concept imagery to feel grounded in Neris's specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, high-density prose fits the aesthetic perfectly, though a few metaphor stacks ("comet hair," "fish in a bowl") border on overwriting. The rhythm propels the scene effectively despite the heavy adjectival load.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of "archaeology via atmospheric calibration" is fresh and specific. The synthesis of the baroque aesthetic with the physics of visible time creates a memorable, non-derivative world.</comment>
