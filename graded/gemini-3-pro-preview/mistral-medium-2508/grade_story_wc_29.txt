<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to prove the signal's intent drives the narrative effectively, creating a proactive protagonist. However, the emotional interiority relies on label-like phrasing ("cautiously hopeful heart") rather than embodied reaction, and the character's specific history as an interpreter feels slightly generic beyond technical competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible, with Liora's interference directly impacting the campus environment and the signal's response. The closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting her role from observer to participant, though the mechanism of the signal affecting arguments is asserted rather than demonstrated until the very end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The basement setting is grounded with specific details like "smudged" ink and "old physics hall" equipment. The atmosphere supports the "ethereal grit" tone well, though the broader campus chaos is told in summary before the student's arrival validates it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and high—sanity and campus unity versus alien manipulation. The escalation is effective, particularly when the signal "laughs" and forces a tactical adjustment, though the personal cost to Liora remains largely hypothetical (career risk) rather than immediately felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of academic satire and cosmic horror works well, thematically linking petty human divisions to external manipulation. The ending's insight about scars versus wounds offers a resonant conceptual closing that elevates the premise beyond a simple plot device.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable tone of conspiratorial seriousness. There is occasional filtering ("Liora watched," "She didn't know") that distances the reader during the climax, but the perspective generally holds firm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is functional and moves the story forward, with some strong images ("voices suddenly too thin to carry weight"). However, it suffers from occasional weak modifiers ("suddenly," "cautiously") and slightly mixed metaphorical imagery ("nest of angry stars") that softens the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of cosmic signals orchestrating university politics is fresh and handled with a grounded seriousness that enhances the satire. The execution avoids the "it was all a dream" trap, delivering a tangible result that validates the high concept.</comment>
