<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct focalizer with a specific worldview ("measured silence in degrees") that colors his narration. His arc from seeking validation to rejecting the "proof" is a clear, earned reversal. The moment of realization relies slightly on a sudden vision rather than active deduction, but the emotional logic holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean causal line: intent leads to ritual, ritual provokes a supernatural response, forcing a Decisive Change. The climax (shattering the prism) acts as a functional closure with a clear before/after state. The link between the car’s frost and the prism works well within the established genre logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quartz arbor is a vivid, integral setting that mirrors the central motif of refraction and shattering. Details like "skeleton of light" and "fractured rainbows" ground the supernatural elements in a specific physical space. The environment actively supports the climax rather than just serving as a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are well-defined: the intellectual desire for proof versus the emotional cost of the truth. Pressure escalates coherently from observation to confrontation. The resolution involves a tangible sacrifice—destroying the heirloom—which gives weight to the decision, though the internal "cost" is somewhat summarized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of carried trauma is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing at the very end ("Some proofs were better left unproven") to land its point. This summarizing statement flattens the resonance of the final image, substituting a stated thesis for the earned subtext of the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending lyrical observation with the character's "mystic" expertise. The prose filter matches Elias's perception ("liminal stretch," "vibration just beyond hearing"). The tone remains controlled, supporting the atmospheric build-up without slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and sensory-rich ("windows etched with intricate frost patterns," "scent of a struck match"). At times, the description leans toward the overwrought ("writhed like trapped things," "sorrowless streams"), but the rhythm generally propels the scene effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reading emotions through frost patterns is a fresh, specific interface for the psychometry trope. While the "haunted object" twist is a familiar genre convention, the synthesis of the quartz arbor setting with the light/prism motif creates a distinct aesthetic package.</comment>
