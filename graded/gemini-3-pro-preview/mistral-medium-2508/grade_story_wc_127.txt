<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liora’s transition from transaction to intervention is driven by a clear internal code, and the "static" mechanic effectively externalizes the chemist's internal state. While the chemist’s tearful reaction is slightly standard, Liora's choice to absorb the "ache" herself provides a strong, cost-bearing character moment that earns the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight, utilizing the static sensing mechanic to pivot the plot naturally from a commercial transaction to a moment of ethical correction. Closure is decisive and resonant, fulfilling the "Resonant Reconfiguration" requirement by permanently altering the client's emotional state and the protagonist's understanding of her role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "amber grotto" is established quickly with distinct sensory details, particularly the synesthetic blend of scent and electricity. The progression of dusk serves as an effective pacing mechanism, grounding the magical transformation in a concrete temporal window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly delineated between the comfort of a lie and the necessity of pain, with the static charge providing a tangible escalation of pressure. The conflict is resolved through Liora’s agency, though the client functions more as a passive recipient of truth than an active opponent once the process begins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "half-truths as loneliness" is integrated organically into the mechanics of the magic system rather than stated abstractly. The final conceptual repricing—equating loneliness with static energy looking for direction—elevates the ending beyond a simple moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished, effectively blending technical precision ("calibrated," "distilled") with lyrical observation to suit the protagonist's profession. The POV remains tightly anchored in Liora’s perception, filtering the client’s emotions strictly through her sensory apparatus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, with strong imagery like "unfolding like a story told backward." A few phrases lean toward the conventional ("metallic tang," "didn't have to"), but the overall density and lack of scaffold sentences support the story's atmospheric weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Combining the trope of an emotion shop with the specific mechanics of static electricity and fragrance chemistry creates a distinct texture. While the narrative arc of enforcing emotional truth is a familiar genre beat, the specific execution and "static" metaphor provide a fresh, cohesive angle.</comment>
