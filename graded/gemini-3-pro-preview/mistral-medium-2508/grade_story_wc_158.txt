<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist serves as a mythic archetype rather than a psychological agent. While consistent with the fable mode, she lacks the "contradictory impulses" and "blind spots" required for higher bands; her "unstoppable" nature removes the internal friction or possibility of failure that generates character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The structure follows a clear dream-logic progression, but causality is soft ("singing turns ghost to kelp") rather than earned through hard choices. The closure—sealing herself in—is a resonant reconfiguration, but the "soft resets" of magical healing lower the causal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "gargantuan shell" with its acoustic properties and "calcium veins" effectively constrains the action and grounds the high-concept magic in specific, tactile details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are high in scope (war vs. peace) but low in tension because the protagonist is an immortal, "unstoppable" force who faces no genuine threat to her safety or capacity. The escalation is thematic rather than a pressure cooker of narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("joy was not the absence of sorrow but its alchemy," "prayer and diagnosis") rather than subtext. This didactic approach flattens resonance and violates the rubric's penalty against thematic echoing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the mythic tone. It maintains a distinct texture ("wind here was always off-key"), though it occasionally risks becoming precious.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose suffers from unrelenting figurative density ("ribs bloomed," "syllable a scar," "photosynthesize pain"), creating a "purple" texture that exhausts the reader. The beauty is evident, but the lack of unadorned sentences to ground the metaphors hinders pacing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of an insomniac shell-poet is imaginative and specific ("eating the paper" is a standout strange detail). However, the central trope of transforming weapons into flowers/nature is familiar ground that isn't radically subverted.</comment>
