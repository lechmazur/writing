<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's transition from bitterness to accepting the "cosmic joke" is compelling and serves as the story's emotional engine, grounding the surreal transformation in character truth. The internal conflict is vivid, though the final pivot feels slightly accelerated by the compressed timeline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The multi-shard structure (discovery, nightfall, aftermath) is legible and effectively builds mythic weight, satisfying Track B requirements. The closure is decisive and costly, transforming the protagonist ontologically in a way that feels earned by the setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground garden functions as an active antagonist rather than a backdrop, exerting pressure through sensory details like "whispering basil" and "hungry" loam. The bioluminescence and tactile elements ground the surreal events perfectly, constraining Elias's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The escalation from research to physical consumption by the garden is coherent and tense. The return of the missing provides necessary external pressure that forces Elias's final choice, ensuring the climax is reactive rather than passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "harmony untamed" vs. human bitterness resolves beautifully in the horrific yet hopeful ending. The "cosmic joke" motif resonates through specific imagery without feeling like a tacked-on moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains a controlled, lyrical mythic tone that supports the surreal content. The shift in perspective at the end enhances the legendary feel without breaking narrative trust or distance consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and atmospheric, successfully sustaining the "frostbitten hope" tone. While simile density is high ("like schools of fish," "like polished river stones"), the imagery generally lands with precision and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid tropes with botanical horror and "static" creates a fresh, distinct aesthetic. The concept of the garden consuming grief to produce a "joke" is genuinely inventive and deftly executed.</comment>
