<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora is a distinct, consistent focalizer with a clear professional duality (beautician/mortician) that informs her worldview. However, her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("echo of a choice never made") rather than specific, grounded emotion, and the attribute "lucidly watchful" is delivered as a narrator tell rather than demonstrated through difficult observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean, linear vignette that moves smoothly from inciting action to resolution. However, causality is low-friction; the chip functions essentially as a magic key without complication or risk of failure, resulting in a predictable sequence. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of obstacle softens the impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is evocative, establishing a strong mood of "radiant hush." However, the description suffers from purple abstraction ("bones of forgotten winds," "petrified mist") that privileges sound over sensory logic. The setting feels more like a poetic construct than a physical place with tactile constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is internal and thematic, lacking significant external pressure or active opposition. The stakes—retrieving a memory—are clear, but the process is frictionless; Liora uses the chip and immediately succeeds. The cost (the spent chip) is paid, but the absence of a moment of doubt or difficulty limits the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in the transition to death is coherent and lands with emotional warmth. However, the resolution ("Tell them it was beautiful") is a familiar trope that borders on sentimental platitude, reducing the potential for a more complex or surprising thematic insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated tone that matches the protagonist's "calling." The distance is well-controlled, staying close to Liora’s perception. The voice falters only when it slips into clichés of the genre ("light that wasn't light").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished but overwritten, relying on "something X but Y" constructions ("not light but something older") and abstract metaphors ("bones of forgotten winds") that obscure meaning. These stylistic flourishes reduce clarity and immediacy, creating a barrier of "fine writing" between the reader and the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi technology (emerald chip) with a mystical mortuary role is engaging. While the "final message from the dead" premise is standard, the specific occupational lens brings a fresh texture. The execution is competent but plays it safe within genre conventions.</comment>
