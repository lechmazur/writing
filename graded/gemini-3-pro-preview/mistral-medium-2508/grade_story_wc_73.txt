<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lena’s characterization as a "grim optimist" is effectively dramatized by her final choice to reject the easy exit in favor of the meaningful struggle. The decision to keep the chipped die and abandon the smooth one perfectly aligns her internal traits with her external action, earning the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the dice mechanic to drive the climax and unlock the surreal logic of the sideways leap. Closure is excellent; the decision to close the door creates a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that recontextualizes the climb not as a prison, but as a valid choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The minimalist setting is handled well, with the sensory focus on the "gray haze" and the tactile "thud" of boots creating a coherent atmosphere. The specific detail of the "seam where the stair met the riser" grounds the surreal glitch in a physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate naturally from abstract understanding to a concrete binary choice at the door. The cost is palpable—she sacrifices the "smooth" resolution and the return to her old life (the café) to maintain the integrity of her "grim" pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of embracing the flaw (the chipped die/recursive loop) over perfection is resonant. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("Perpetual motion wasn’t a failure. It was a choice"), reducing the interpretive depth and triggering a penalty for moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice remains consistent, blending mathematical precision ("proof in motion," "closed system") with atmospheric tension. The shift from analytical observation to the breathless action of the leap is managed smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A conspicuous typo ("The pain was a anchor") disrupts the reading experience. While the rhythm is generally strong, reliance on "telling" blocks for backstory ("Lena was a grim optimist," "She had come here to...") drags the momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of an infinite stair is a familiar trope, but the specific mechanic of using a chipped die to find a recursive glitch adds ingenuity. The rejection of the "escape door" serves as a refreshing subversion of the typical escape narrative.</comment>
