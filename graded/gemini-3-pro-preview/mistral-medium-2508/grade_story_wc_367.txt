<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Liora functions more as a mythic archetype than a grounded character; the "laughter as a weapon" trait is asserted via narration rather than dramatized through specific interactions or consequences. Her loss of control with the prophecy offers a glimpse of interiority, but her subsequent return to routine lacks emotional cost or processing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "accidental prophecy" creates a massive causal promise ("next sunrise will be the last") that the cyclical "earned stasis" ending ignores; the narrative treats the prophecy as atmospheric flavor rather than a plot driver, leaving a significant loose thread at closure. The drive lens is Situational, but the causality of the climax is muddy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere is distinct and sensory, effectively blending the "salt-worn" physical reality with the "static of old radio broadcasts." However, the description occasionally slips into abstraction ("teeth of time," "color that bent") that weakens the specificity of the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central conflict is resolved through internal willpower ("steered... with her will") rather than a tangible tactical trade-off or clever use of the established mechanics. While the pressure of the storm is felt, the protagonist's victory feels inevitable and lacks a specific on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The themes of forgotten history and cyclical duty are coherent, anchored well by the "unprinted headlines" motif. The resonance is slightly dampened by the unresolved implication of the prophecy, which muddies the thematic weight of the dawn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and consistently atmospheric, fitting the mythic tone. It occasionally drifts into melodramatic distancing ("chorus of the long-dead") but maintains a strong stylistic texture throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose has strong rhythm and momentum but is marred by stock phrases ("teeth of time," "split like a ripe fruit") and vague descriptors ("light that wasn’t quite light"). These clichés undercut the otherwise sharp imagery of the lighthouse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a lighthouse guiding monsters rather than ships, combined with the post-print retro-futurism, is fresh and engaging. The execution leans on familiar fantasy tropes, but the core synthesis of elements is original.</comment>
