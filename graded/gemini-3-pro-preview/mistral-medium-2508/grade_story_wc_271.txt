<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is visceral and specifically grounded in the somatic prompt elements. Her contradictory impulse—wanting to freeze time versus the inevitable pull of the present—resolves beautifully through the physical act of releasing the photograph. The transition from trauma survivor to active participant (pruning) is earned through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the release of the photo and the return to pruning mark a decisive shift in stance with visible emotional cost. The pacing is controlled, moving from internal stasis to external friction (the tourists) and back to a changed internal state. The drive lens (Accumulative/Situational) holds perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active, not static; the cypress tree, the wind, and the stone wall directly constrain the action and facilitate the somatic grounding. The specific sensory details—citrus oil, rough stone, salt air—anchor the abstract concepts of grief and time in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conflict is largely internal but effectively externalized by the intrusion of the tour group, which pressures Lena’s "freeze." The escalation—from holding the photo to the child misidentifying it as a bird—forces a recontextualization of her grief without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of "making room" rather than "letting go" is powerfully realized through the central metaphor of pruning. While the final reflection ("Optimism was the quiet talent...") is slightly explicit, it feels earned by the preceding sensory work and ties the prompt elements together cohesively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, blending lyrical observation with the stark reality of trauma. The close third-person perspective manages the shift between memory and present sensation with tight control, avoiding unmotivated distance shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion. The explicit definition of the "somatic method" ("a trick learned from a trauma therapist") is a minor expository bump, but necessary for the prompt; otherwise, the imagery ("veins mirrored the cracks") is precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drone strike survivor narrative with the quiet, restorative setting of an arboretum feels fresh and devoid of cliché. The transformation of the photo into a "bird" via the child's perspective is a genuine moment of ingenuity that reframes the tragedy.</comment>
