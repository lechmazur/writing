<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora is drawn with distinct interiority ("forgiving skeptic"), and the bone-setting skill effectively frames her agency. However, her competence is nearly absolute; she faces the antagonist and succeeds without significant internal struggle or a difficult micro-choice that forces a trade-off, making her victory feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the causal chain (tooth to confrontation to bargain) is clear. The closure, however, lacks the "visible or felt cost" required for higher bands. The resolution—trading wounds for stars and receiving the brother back "unmarked"—resolves the tension too neatly, effectively externalizing the price and leaving the protagonist largely unchanged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "waxy green" and "pulsed faintly" grounding the magical elements. The garden functions well as a pressure cooker for the confrontation, though the transition from maze to garden is a standard portal beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stakes are established early, but the climax suffers from a lack of resistance. The changeling accepts Liora's bargain ("Turn them into stars") immediately, dissolving the central conflict without a contest of wills or a painful sacrifice. The antagonist functions more as a lock waiting to be turned than an opposing force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The bone-setting metaphor integrates well with the theme of healing. However, the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("Some cracks were meant to let the light in," "Now she knew how to set the world"), which flattens the subtext into a summary statement rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, maintaining a "shrewdly innocent" tone that matches the protagonist. The prose texture supports the mythic quality of the story effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with good density and rhythm ("too small to be human, too sharp to be animal"). There are no significant prose artifacts or scaffolding loops, though some imagery ("eyes like polished river stones") leans toward familiar genre tropes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of changeling folklore with a bone-setter protagonist is fresh and engaging. However, the resolution mechanics (turning wounds to stars, a clean return) tread very familiar ground for the genre, lacking a distinct twist or subversion to elevate the concept further.</comment>
