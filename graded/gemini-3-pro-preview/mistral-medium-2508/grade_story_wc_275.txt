<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s internal landscape is rich, reconciling her father's violence with her own nurturing role. However, the decision to stay feels like a settled state recalled from memory ("You were supposed to leave") rather than a choice actively forged against the immediate rising pressure of the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The situational lens holds firmly, delivering a clean moment of Earned Stasis. The causal loop is elegant: the sandbag that cracked the dome is repurposed to support life, physically manifesting the theme of repair within the scene's window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the tactile "vibration" of the panic outside felt through the glass. The atmospheric contrast between the humid, breathing interior and the dry "scream of dust" outside effectively grounds the stakes in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While the stakes are existential, the immediate pressure is dampened by the protagonist's Zen-like competence and the physical barrier of the dome. The external threat feels somewhat remote, making the cost of staying read as theoretical rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of continuity is well-dramatized through the repurposing of the wreckage. While phrases like "turning weapons into whispers" verge on being too explicit, the final image of weaving the world together "one thorn at a time" offers earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally distinct and lyrical but occasionally stumbles into overwrought modification (e.g., "senselessly perceptive silence"). The reflective tone suits the pacing, though it sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled, but lexical choices like "inculcating the roots" distract, clashing with the physical immediacy of gardening. A few standard metaphors ("scream of dust," "sandcastle under a boot") dilute the otherwise high-resolution imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The trope of the healer redeeming a violent parent's legacy in a wasteland is familiar. However, the specific use of the airship ballast—transforming the instrument of destruction into a splint for the sapling—adds a fresh, tactile layer to the premise.</comment>
