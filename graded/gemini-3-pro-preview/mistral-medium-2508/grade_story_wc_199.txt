<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Liora functions effectively as an archetypal steward, but she lacks internal friction or conflicting desires. Her progression feels ordained rather than chosen through struggle; she accepts the call without doubt or cost until the final transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mythic structure is solid, moving clearly from the inciting discovery to the transformative closure. The "hush" and the arbor's reaction create a coherent causal logic, though the ease of her ascent reduces narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the floating arbor and the specific, tactile monuments (thimble of salt, pebble stack) creating a vivid, memorable world. The environment actively shapes the narrative possibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; Liora faces no external opposition, and the environment yields to her immediately (monuments melt, branches form ladders). While the final transformation is a cost, the lack of resistance during the climb flattens the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of sorting stories and the transformation of the self is resonant and well-integrated. The explicit statement of the theme ("Prophecy was a seed") at the end feels slightly didactic, but the imagery supports it well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone suited to the fable-like quality of the story. The pacing controls the release of information well, though the mood is somewhat uniform.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally evocative prose is marred by a jarring tense error ("She prod the moonstone again" instead of "prodded") at a pivotal moment. The rhythm is otherwise good, though some imagery leans toward the conventional ("iridescent as a dragonfly’s wing").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a seed sorter on a floating arbor organizing prophecies is fresh and imaginative. The specific details of the forgotten monuments add a layer of unique, melancholic creativity that elevates the premise.</comment>
