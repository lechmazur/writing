<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elira's internal landscape is vivid, and her shift from active purger to passive vessel ("I am the loom") creates a meaningful arc. Her motivation to relieve burdens is palpable, though the "fractal weaver" identity feels like a label disconnected from the lamp-based mechanics shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear arc of escalation to a Conceptual Repricing (accepting the "loom" role). The closure lands with the cost of her eventual disappearance, recontextualizing the central conflict effectively, though the transition to the epilogue summary is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is an active participant, pressing back against the protagonist and forcing the climax. The acoustic and tactile details ("shingled hush," "cool metal") ground the surreal elements beautifully, making the setting indispensable to the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates clearly from the resistance of the specific burdens (the child's fear) to the overwhelming weight of the grotto itself. The conflict resolves through internal realignment rather than external victory, fitting the atmospheric tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of processing grief—transformation rather than erasure—is handled with nuance. The realization that burdens are "part of the hush" resonates, avoiding a tidy or overly moralistic conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical distance appropriate for a fable. However, the rhythm is occasionally disrupted by required prompt phrases that feel inserted rather than organic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While vivid, the prose suffers from a repetitive simile cadence ("thick as kelp," "sharp as... chisel," "light as... wing") in adjacent lines, creating a template effect. The adverbial construction "boundary-lessly" is clunky and disrupts the sentence flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bronze grotto with burden-calcification is fresh and evocative. While the "fractal weaver" concept feels slightly underutilized, the specific imagery of the lamp and the grotto's acoustics elevates the premise.</comment>
