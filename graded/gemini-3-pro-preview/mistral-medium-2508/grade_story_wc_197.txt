<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lena is a coherent focalizer with clear motivation, but her transition from "harmless archivist" to arsonist happens off-page, weakening the character arc's credibility. The "Years later" summary flattens her into a historical footnote rather than a lived consciousness at the moment of highest cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative builds a causal chain (the call, the decision) but skips the climax (the heist/fire) entirely, resolving via summary aftermath. The shift to an omniscient historical overview in the final section deflates the tension and explains the outcome rather than dramatizing the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "auric lagoon" and "shimmering with trapped starlight" create a distinct, immersive atmosphere that grounds the magical elements. The sensory details of the booth (static, ozone, rust) effectively anchor the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the cost of the rebellion is theoretical; we see Lena safe in a diner the next day, minimizing the felt danger. The escalation relies on the phone call's urgency, but the lack of on-page confrontation limits the visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of "quiet rebellion" is poignant but heavily explicated through lines like "Indifference was the real tyrant" and the historian's summary. The ending tells the reader how to interpret the story rather than letting the resonance emerge from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV is tightly controlled on Lena for the first two sections but breaks into unauthorized omniscience in the "Years later" coda. This head-hop to a future historical perspective disrupts the established intimacy and narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, though occasionally verges on purple ("sky bled violet," "liquid memory"). Rhythm is well-managed, though the reliance on summary in the final third saps the momentum generated in the opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of decoding puddles is inventive and fresh. However, the execution falls into a standard "unsung hero" trope with a safe, summarized resolution that avoids the riskier narrative work of the heist itself.</comment>
