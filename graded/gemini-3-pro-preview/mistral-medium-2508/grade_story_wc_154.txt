<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena is drawn with strong interiority and a consistent worldview, but her empathy functions almost as a flawless superpower. The lack of a dramatized blind spot or struggle in "reading" the boy limits complexity; she solves his trauma without risk or error.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The structure is a clean situational vignette, and the closure (giving the coral) lands with genuine cost. However, the final image of the glowing cast risks a late genre break into fantasy that jars against the established psychological realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and immersive, effectively using the "mist" and "twilight" to mirror the internal state of limbo. The specific details of the atrium and the debris of war ground the scene well, though the atmosphere is relentlessly heavy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation is present via the boy's arrival, and giving up the grounding object (coral) provides a felt cost (Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the conflict resolves too smoothly; the boy accepts Lena's reframing instantly, lowering the dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of translating grief is poignant and clear, though the narrative tends to state its thesis explicitly ("She was a grafter"). The emotional resonance is high, but the "lesson" feels slightly delivered rather than discovered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and tightly anchored to Lena's translator persona. It effectively blurs the line between memory and the present, though it maintains a high register that rarely relaxes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from simile density ("like old barbed wire," "like a held note," "like the radio"), which creates a breathless, overwritten texture. The metaphor of "ribs singing" borders on the melodramatic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of translating pain is compelling, but the execution leans into "wise healer" tropes with a convenient resolution. The story feels safe and competent rather than risky or ingeniously fresh.</comment>
