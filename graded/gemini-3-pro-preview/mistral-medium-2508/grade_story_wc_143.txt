<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is sharply drawn, with the tension between his role (inspector) and his intent (preservation) driving the scene. Interiority is vivid, though the emotional summary near the end ("Men of the space age didn't cry") relies on a generalized label rather than purely embodied cost. The final gesture with the camera screen effectively grounds the emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly structured around the shrinking window of time (dawn/drones), creating effective situational pressure. Closure is achieved through a resonant reconfiguration—the physical crater is lost, but the "lie of permanence" is secured. The pacing matches the "accumulative" lens well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are evocative, particularly the "chemical cocktail" and "green shimmer" which ground the atmospheric description in specific action. The setting is integral to the plot. Some descriptions ("silence so vast it hummed") lean toward cliché, but the visual specificity of the ending compensates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The conflict (preservation vs. industry) is internal but externalized effectively through the countdown and the approaching drones. The stakes are clear and the protagonist's agency (planting the canister, taking the photos) is active. The cost is conceptual—the acceptance of loss—which fits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of transience and memory is coherent, but the story relies on explicit summarization in the final paragraphs ("world that would never know what it had lost," "slow death of wonder"). This telling of the theme reduces the resonant power of the final image/action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, melancholic, and appropriately paced. It occasionally slips into melodrama ("swollen with unspoken promises," "universe clearing its throat"), but the narrative distance is generally well-controlled and intimate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically sound but suffers from overwriting and density of figurative language ("ghosts of light," "knife-edge," "lover's farewell"). The metaphor "Earth hung like a pale jewel, swollen with unspoken promises" is mixed and slightly opaque. Line-level momentum is generally good despite the ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "last observer" trope is elevated by the specific invention of the bioluminescent time-marker and the irony of the protagonist's job title. While the emotional beats are familiar, the synthesis of elements feels organic and the "lie of permanence" offers a nice conceptual angle.</comment>
