<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle is palpable, though the "scream he'd never let himself voice" relies on stock emotional shorthand. The emotional pivot from frustration to acceptance is earned through the "spectral mentorship," but the resolution relies heavily on the father's direct instruction rather than the carver's own agency or grit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, utilizing the "spectral mentorship" as a taught mechanism to resolve the inciting incident (the cracked stone) without breaking causality. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the concept of grief, though the linear progression feels slightly safe and the solution arrives a bit too easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sensory environment is vivid and active; the greenhouse acting as a lantern with butterfly patterns is a standout image that charges the ending. The setting directly influences the atmosphere and the final realization, integrating well with the "hollows" metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to memorialize the sister—is clear, but the conflict is resolved primarily by the ghost's external intervention rather than the protagonist's active struggle. The cost is conceptual (accepting the void) rather than an enacted price paid on the page, lowering the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("Grief isn’t a line...") and the final paragraph's summary ("The dead were not gone..."). This tendency to explain the metaphor via direct statement reduces the subtextual power of the hollows image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the magical realism tone. However, the rhythmic cadence becomes predictable, particularly in the repeated use of antithetical phrasing ("Not X, but Y") to define the experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense but suffers from a recurring template artifact ("Not [X], but [Y]") used four times to define key elements, creating a repetitive cadence. Some phrasing leans toward purple ("dusk bled," "bruised violet"), slightly dulling the sharpness of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "spectral mentorship" as a mundane trade custom is a distinct, inventive twist that revitalizes the ghost trope. The integration of the carving technique with the philosophy of grief feels fresh, even if the butterfly symbolism is familiar.</comment>
