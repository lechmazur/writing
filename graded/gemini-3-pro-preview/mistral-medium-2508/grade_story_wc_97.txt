<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (reunion), but the character lacks internal conflict; her journey is a linear execution of a plan without emotional doubt or contradictory impulses. The "steely longing" is stated via simile rather than dramatized through friction or resistance in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative relies on dream logic where "splicing film" conveniently solves the physical separation without established ground rules or cost. The ending creates a "happy reunion" that explicitly bypasses consequence ("above the rules of endings"), missing the required felt cost for literary closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "tidal arbor" is a vivid, specific setting that anchors the surrealism effectively, with details like "ivories yellowed by salt" establishing a cohesive atmosphere. The environment interacts well with the mechanics of the plot, grounding the magical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Escalation is present via the dying projector bulb and encroaching night, creating effective external pressure. However, the conflict is resolved too neatly by the magic mechanism, lacking a deep test of the protagonist's resolve or a moment of genuine doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of art bridging reality is coherent, but the treatment leans into sentimental tropes ("ghost of what could have been"). The resonance is softened by the lack of ambiguity or difficulty in the final reunion, rendering the subtext somewhat flat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally overwrought, creating distance from the character's immediate struggle. The dialogue ("You're late," "So are you") feels staged and slightly cliché for the emotional weight of the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from a high density of clichés ("ghost of what could have been," "dying fireflies," "blade of a knife") and heavy-handed similes. This overuse of stock figurative language obscures the immediacy of the action and weakens the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The central concept of a station in a tree using film to splice reality is imaginative and fresh, offering a unique visual hook. However, the execution falls into familiar romantic reunion tropes that undermine the novelty of the setup.</comment>
