<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena is a compelling focalizer; her motivation to "salvage" creates a strong internal crucible that mirrors the widow's external grief. The shared moment of vulnerability with the locket earns the emotional connection, though the widow’s pivot from resistance to acceptance feels slightly rushed for the weight of the revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (widow healed, Lena resigned) lands with resonant cost. However, the logic of the reveal—specifically why the widow would need to be told her child survived, or if she knew and simply ignored it to chase the ghost—relies on slightly ambiguous phrasing ("dreams had been showing her the wrong ghost") that creates a momentary stumble in causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the glacier shrine and the melted snow globe are not just atmospheric backdrops but constraints that shape the ritual and the revelation. The sensory details ("scent of salt and diesel," "hull splitting like a wishbone") ground the magical realism in visceral, tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is primarily internal but effective; the pressure builds through the widow's resistance and releases through the visual turn in the snow globe. The "deepening" occurs when Lena moves from observer to participant by revealing her own locket, raising the stakes from professional duty to shared human loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "salvaging the parts worth saving" is tightly woven through character, action, and object. While the final sentiment about "cracks" and "light" borders on derivative, the earlier exploration of grief as wreckage to be mined is fresh and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident and atmospheric, successfully blending the gritty (diesel, wreckage) with the ethereal. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader firmly in Lena’s weary, perceptive headspace, though it occasionally dips into slightly purple abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally strong with high-density imagery ("teardrop of glass"). However, the score is capped by the use of worn clichés ("liquid gold") and the uncredited near-quotation of Leonard Cohen ("cracks were how the light got in") as a concluding profundity, which weakens the otherwise original voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of a "wreckage shrine" in a glacier is a creative synthesis of ghost story and fantasy elements. The specific mechanism of the melted snow globe acting as a window into the truth is an ingenious, specific touch that elevates the standard "medium" trope.</comment>
