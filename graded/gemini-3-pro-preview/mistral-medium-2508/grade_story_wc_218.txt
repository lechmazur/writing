<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elira’s characterization is sharply drawn through physical detail ("knees cracking like old timber") and defiance. Her motivation to "remodel" rather than wither is compelling and drives the narrative. Tomas acts as a necessary counterweight, and his conversion is earned through the on-page demonstration of the sapling's response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is efficient, moving clearly from the established conflict to a resolution that carries cost (Elira’s life, Tomas’s assumption of the burden). The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "heresy" becomes the new tradition. The time jumps are handled cleanly with section breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is integral, functioning as both the antagonist (the unyielding stone) and the medium of the protagonist's art. Sensory details are vivid and thematic ("stone curved like a ribcage," "pulse of roots"), creating a tangible atmosphere that constrains and shapes the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: the survival of Elira's philosophy against the temple's rigidity. The escalation from verbal debate to the physical proof of the sapling's movement is effective. Tomas's final choice to wrap the wire represents a visible, felt cost—he is committing his future to her "heresy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of symbiotic bending versus rigid symmetry is woven well through the imagery. However, the explicit thesis statement in the diary ("We were never meant to outlast...") borders on a "Thematic Echo" artifact, articulating the moral too neatly rather than letting the final image of Tomas weaving stand alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The distinct lyricism of the narrative voice fits the botanical/architectural subject matter. The POV switch from Elira to Tomas is handled correctly via a section break, allowing for a coherent hand-off of agency at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong, consistent imagery ("joints to brittle hinges," "breath... like wind through dead leaves") that unifies the body and the orchard. The rhythm supports the pacing, and there are no significant scaffold artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of "botanical masonry" using copper wire is an ingenious and fresh specific. While the "dying mentor passes the torch" structure is traditional, the unique method and setting elevate the execution.</comment>
