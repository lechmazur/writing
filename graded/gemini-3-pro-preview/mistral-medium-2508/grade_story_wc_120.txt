<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Li Wei is drawn with exceptional specificity; the "homesickness as a when" insight grounds his internal conflict. The shift from passive oracle to active conductor is earned through the memory of the father and the shell, culminating in a choice that reclaims his agency against the city’s demand.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, moving from routine to resistance under the Accumulative lens. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Li Wei reframes the noise of the ice as a symphony he controls, satisfying the setup with a legible conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are not just backdrop but active participants that shape the acoustics and the light/shadow play essential to the "conducting" metaphor. The "air tasted of ice and old electricity" establishes a distinct, pressurized atmosphere immediately.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—artistic agency vs. commodified prophecy—is clear and escalates as the courier (external pressure) intrudes on his epiphany. The choice to delay the courier creates a moment of Charged Poise, though the external consequences (cost) are more atmospheric than strictly material.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of mapping personal memory onto public prophecy is woven beautifully into the plot. The ending resolves the central question of agency ("The silence is not empty") without moralizing, offering a resonant image of the protagonist imposing order on chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is controlled and lyrical, matching the protagonist's sensibilities without slipping into purple prose. The perceptual signature is distinct—hearing the cats by pitch, seeing the shell as a floorplan—reinforcing the character's unique worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("unzip itself from the dark"), with strong rhythm. A minor spatial ambiguity regarding the courier's location (intercom vs. knock echoing up) slightly blurs the physical blocking, but the line-level craft is otherwise polished and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fortune-telling bureaucrat with a frustrated conductor is fresh and specific. The reimagining of homesickness as a temporal rather than spatial dislocation adds depth to the premise, elevating it beyond a standard "magic realist" vignette.</comment>
