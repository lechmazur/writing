<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The protagonist functions competently as a vessel for the concept, but her interiority relies on asserted labels ("wit as dry as ink stains") rather than demonstrated complexity. Her acceptance of the sacrificial role is immediate and frictionless, lacking the internal contradiction or struggle that would deepen engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causality follows a coherent dream-logic suitable for the genre, with a clear inciting incident and a Decisive Change at closure. The narrative loop is closed effectively, though the "you have always been" revelation relies on circular fate rather than active causal compounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and actively pressures the narrative; details like the condensation map and "old parchment" sky tightly integrate with the protagonist's editorial lens. The atmosphere successfully carries the weight of the story, making the environment an essential antagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are high and the cost is paid in full at the end, satisfying the requirement for a felt price. However, the escalation feels linear because the protagonist offers no resistance to her fate, resulting in a slide toward destiny rather than a climb through conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of "beginnings" and mapping nature is resonant and clearly articulated through the specific lens of the atlas editor. However, the explicit announcement at the climax ("You are the herald") flattens the subtext into text, reducing the interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, polished, and atmospherically appropriate, maintaining a "worrying tranquility" throughout. Narrative distance is well-managed, though the tone occasionally drifts into slightly breathless melodrama ("bloom of liquid darkness").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense with effective imagery ("reunited like rivers"), supporting the magical realism tone without confusion. A few clichés ("wasn't supposed to be here") and heavy reliance on pathetic fallacy ("sighing" ice, "groaning" beams) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central inversion—rivers drawn to a singularity rather than flowing from a source—is a fresh and compelling concept. While the "chosen herald" trope is familiar, the mapping/editing angle provides a specific and original entry point.</comment>
