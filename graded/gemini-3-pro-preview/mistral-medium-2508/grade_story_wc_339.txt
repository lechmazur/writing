<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's transition from "untangling threads" to accepting a mystery she cannot solve is a strong, earned arc. Her internal conflict is palpable, and the choice to lie serves as a decisive renunciation of her analytic nature in favor of a heavier truth. The backstory of the sister, while brief, effectively grounds her intimacy with loss ("threshold she'd never crossed").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal/Situational line: discovery leads to anomaly, which forces a stance crystallization (the lie). Closure is excellent, with the decision to suppress the finding acting as a Decisive Change carrying a legible emotional weight ("sediment"). Causality holds firm, integrating the supernatural element without breaking the story's internal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active; the "warped mahogany," "pulpy sculptures" of books, and the "cloying pressure" create a tangible atmosphere. The snow globe functions as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains the character's understanding of physics and drives the climax. The environment actively pressures the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established: the historical weight of the Electra versus the metaphysical danger of the threshold. The pressure escalates naturally through the snow globe's anomaly, forcing a trade-off between professional integrity and protective secrecy. The cost is felt in the "shadow left behind" and the burden of the lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "letting go" and the "cost of light" is woven seamlessly into the narrative action and artifacts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the initial premise of "untangling threads" into a profound acceptance of the unknown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, maintaining a "sophisticated melancholy" that fits the protagonist's analytic but grieving nature. Pacing is managed well, with the shift in the snow globe's gravity mirroring the shift in the prose's focus from observation to internalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally high quality with strong density and rhythm ("books had bloated into pulpy sculptures"). A few similes lean slightly toward the melodramatic ("ink had bled... like old tears," "flickered like fallen stars"), which prevents a higher score, but the final image of the sediment is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the Earhart mystery with a supernatural/spacetime "fold" is fresh and handled with restraint. Using a snow globe as a gravitational anomaly detector is an ingenious detail that grounds the speculative element in a specific, tangible object.</comment>
