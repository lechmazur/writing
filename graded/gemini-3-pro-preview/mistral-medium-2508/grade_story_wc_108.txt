<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's stunt background informs her perception effectively (decoding the cast via "pressure here, pivot there"). However, the shift from paralyzing fear to confidence feels slightly rushed, and the "liability" backstory relies on efficient but heavy expository summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands with a tangible discovery (the ledger), but the path to it relies on a "magical GPS" beat where the shell dictates the exact location ("Third shelf, behind the atlas"). This reduces the protagonist's agency in solving the puzzle herself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "rusted library" and "sky thick with stars" create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that supports the tone. The sensory details of the shell and the cast are specific and grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes of erasure are high and clear. The conflict is primarily internal (fear) and investigative; the antagonist is absent, reducing immediate pressure, but the internal escalation toward the decision to "dive" works well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("proving that the very things they called weaknesses were the cracks that let the light in"), violating the "show, don't tell" preference for thematic resonance. This sermonizing flattens the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and fits the noir-fantasy genre. It occasionally leans into standard phrasing ("The title mocked her"), but the stunt-driver interiority adds a distinct texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is functional but heavy on adjectives and similes ("groaned beneath the weight," "sagging like old bones"). The use of the cliché "cracks that let the light in" detracts from the freshness of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a stunt double being "erased" and replaced by a fiction is compelling and fresh. The blend of corporate thriller elements with magical realism (the shell) is distinctive.</comment>
