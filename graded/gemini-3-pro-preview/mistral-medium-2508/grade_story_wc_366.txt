<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct, stoic archetype whose internal shift—from rigid isolation to communal acceptance—is legible. However, the pivot from burning letters to fully accepting the supernatural connection feels slightly frictionless, lacking the internal resistance or doubt that would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure effectively builds to the closure of abandoning the skiff, a clear Decisive Change. However, the physical mechanics of the letters (appearing in crates Elias presumably loaded himself) rely on a fuzzy dream logic that slightly undermines the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is excellent, grounding the supernatural elements in the tactile reality of &quot;rust and old wax,&quot; salt pork, and stone. The atmosphere is the story's strongest engine, effectively pressuring the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes of isolation versus connection are clear, and the decision to let the skiff rot is a meaningful cost. However, the external opposition is minimal; the &quot;ghosts&quot; are immediately benevolent, making the climax feel more like an invitation accepted than a conflict fought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of shared burden is coherent, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing (&quot;The lamp was dead. The light wasn't.&quot;) which flattens the subtext. This on-the-nose thesis statement in the final lines reduces the resonant ambiguity required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical. However, it is heavily compromised by the repetitive metaphorical tics noted in Q7, which make the narrator's lexical range feel artificial and constrained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose is marred by a severe repetitive artifact: the simile stem &quot;held [breath/note]&quot; appears five times (paras 4, 21, 29, 31, 38). This looping creates a template cadence that distracts significantly from otherwise evocative imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story offers a polished, atmospheric take on the lighthouse-ghost trope. While the &quot;building a door&quot; resolution is a nice fresh turn, the core elements remain familiar; the execution elevates the concept rather than reinventing it.</comment>
