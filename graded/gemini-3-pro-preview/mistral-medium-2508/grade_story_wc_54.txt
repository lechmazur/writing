<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lena is a distinct, capable protagonist whose "functional creativity" drives the plot; her choice to repurpose rather than restore shows strong agency. Her internal monologue occasionally drifts into abstract theming rather than embodied emotion, distancing the reader slightly from her immediate state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure—repurposing the terminal as a bridge—is a strong Conceptual Repricing that lands with clear meaning. However, the mechanical plot hinge (a carnival sextant perfectly fitting a spaceport hydroponics valve) relies on convenient "dream logic" that strains the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "burnt sugar" and "algae-thick water" grounding the fabulist elements. The metaphor of the floor plan as a "circuit board" effectively filters the environment through the protagonist's engineer POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (utility vs. ruin) is clear, and the escalation to a "resurrected" terminal works well. The conflict remains low-pressure and largely internal; the lack of significant external resistance or cost makes the resolution feel slightly frictionless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of pragmatic progress is coherent, but the explicit equation written at the end ("Hope = Flow × Resistance") flattens subtext into text. This overt moralizing in the final beats acts as a "Thematic Echo" penalty, reducing the story's lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, blending technical terms with melancholy observation. At times, it leans into "writerly" abstraction ("hope itself had been a fleeting attraction") rather than staying close to Lena's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery is generally strong, but the prose relies on a repetitive rhetorical template ("She didn't X. She Y.") three separate times. This recurring cadence creates a rhythmic artifact that feels mechanical and draws attention to the author's hand.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesizing spaceport ruins with civil engineering creates a fresh, grounded resolution to a sci-fi premise. Subverting the "repair the spaceship" trope by turning the terminal into a pedestrian highway bridge is a genuinely ingenious conceptual turn.</comment>
