<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc from rigid duty to acceptance is compelling and well-dramatized. The shift is earned through engagement with the setting and memory, culminating in a decisive physical choice (binding the ribbon) that reflects a changed worldview. The character's "quartz-eye" nature adds ironic depth to their blindness regarding the daughter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, moving from discovery to action to realization. The magical realism element (instant sprout) functions as a fable-like accelerator for the climax, fitting the tone well. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mender adopts the daughter's philosophy—lands with clear conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, merging the cathedral and orchard into a single cohesive metaphor that constrains the action (roots in marble) and drives the theme. The imagery of "ribs" and "rose window" provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that feels essential to the narrative logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are personal and relational, focused on bridging a generational divide. The cost is internal but made visible: the mender swallows their pride ("too proud to ask") and physically binds themselves to a new promise, paying a felt emotional price for understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "deciduous vows"—that promises must evolve or die—is woven beautifully into the central metaphor of the orchard reclaiming the stone. The final image of the apple and the ribbon synthesizes the premise with the plot resolution perfectly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and atmospheric. However, the distinctness of the POV is slightly dampened by a reliance on scaffolded comparisons ("as if," "like") which creates a filter between the character's perception and the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>While grammatically clean, the prose relies heavily on similes and "as if" constructions (over 12 instances, e.g., "like a nail," "like leaves," "as if whispering"), diluting immediacy. Several comparisons approach cliché ("thin as skin," "warm as breath," "uneven as a heartbeat"), which detracts from the otherwise high literary ambition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "quartz-eye mender" with the concept of "deciduous vows" in a ruined cathedral is fresh and evocative. The story effectively transforms the trope of the estranged parent through specific, magical-realist details.</comment>
