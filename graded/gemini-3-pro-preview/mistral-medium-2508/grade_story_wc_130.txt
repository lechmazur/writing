<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal conflict—precision vs. ambiguity—is dramatized effectively through the ritual. The shift from an obsessive need to "solve" grief to an earned acceptance of loss is motivated by the on-page failure of the spell to fully restore the past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a climax that forces a Conceptual Repricing. While the closure is distinct, the final "workshop" coda drifts into summary, slightly diluting the immediacy of the cavern exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active and constraining; the stalactites and mosaic are not just scenery but the specific interface for the magic. The sensory details ("slow, silver pulse," "pulp black and glistening") are vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but clearly defined; the escalation comes from the ritual's partial success forcing a choice between illusion and truth. The cost is legible in the "clouded eye" and the emptiness of the satchel at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the theme is coherent, the ending relies on explicit thesis statements ("Some losses were too ambiguous...") to ensure the reader understands. This overt moralizing substitutes summary for resonance in the final beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific, blending mathematical terminology with magical imagery. The density of metaphor fits the protagonist's worldview without breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished and rhythmic with strong image density. However, the final paragraphs shift into expository telling ("He would call it...") which creates a slight drag on momentum compared to the dramatized scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of taxidermy, mosaics, and mathematical magic offers a fresh interface for a grief story. The specific image of the glass eyes locking into the stone elevates the premise above standard fare.</comment>
