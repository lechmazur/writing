<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias is a superbly realized protagonist; his face-blindness is not merely a label but a sensory filter that defines his interaction with the world (texture, sound, thermal resonance). The internal arc from suppressed empathy to accepting the burden of "witness" is effectively dramatized through the specific memory of the dancer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the goal shifts from justice to witness. While the "lance" functions as a highly efficient tool that bypasses investigative friction, the emotional logic of the closure remains sound and impactful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting specificity is exceptional, particularly the juxtaposition of the industrial quarry and the submerged ballroom. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's sensory experience and charges the final image, fulfilling the high-band requirement for setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving the "old guilt"—escalates clearly through the ritual. The external conflict is resolved by a static constraint (the "untouchable" mayor's son), which forces a poignant internal trade-off (witness vs. justice), providing a felt cost at the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing the invisible coheres perfectly with the protagonist's condition and the cold case concept. The ending, positioning him as a "portraitist of the invisible," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central dramatic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, atmospheric, and rigorously adherent to the POV's perceptual limits. The psychic distance is managed well, moving from detached observation to deep interiority during the vision without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and polished with high information density. However, a high frequency of "like/as" similes (e.g., "like a question," "like a pulse," "like sighs") creates a slight pattern artifact that occasionally prioritizes decoration over momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of noir tropes, magical realism (the lance, echoes), and the specific disability perspective creates a genuinely fresh narrative. The concept of the quarry as a drowned ballroom adds a unique layer of ingenuity to the setting.</comment>
