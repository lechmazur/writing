<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The engineer is active and competent, with agency driving the climax. However, the interiority relies on explicit labeling ("Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay") rather than embodied contradiction, which flattens the psychological nuance of the sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong, with the engineer's actions directly influencing the outcome. The closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation/buying time), though the shift from "bomb" to "stabilizing beam" relies heavily on asserted technobabble rather than established mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sensory details of the marina and the resonator are vivid and specific ("dust that glittered like crushed pearl"). The setting actively constrains the plot (thinning ice), though the spatial layout of the marina itself remains slightly impressionistic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and high. The physical cost ("nerves rewriting") is legible, though the result feels more like an ecstatic ascension than a painful trade-off, which slightly softens the impact of the "martyrdom" theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The thematic pivot from "absolution" to "work" and "adaptation" is excellent, grounding the high-concept magic in labor. The story creates a coherent argument about function over form, effectively recontextualizing the religious backstory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the wintery, ethereal tone. It manages the shift from technical observation to metaphysical experience well, though the "ancient thing" tag at the end feels like a voice shift toward generic horror tropes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While the imagery is generally strong, the prose leans on clichés ("bruised sky," "sunset bled gold," "ragged, wet gasps") and metaphor stacking. The "Logic demanded/Emotion demanded" parallel structure reads as a scaffold artifact rather than organic thought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering with sonic theology is fresh and engaging. The ending, however, drifts into a familiar "Eldritch entity stirring" trope that feels less distinct than the "work as prayer" resolution preceding it.</comment>
