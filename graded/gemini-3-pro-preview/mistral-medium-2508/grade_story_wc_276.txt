<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist’s stoicism ("didn't flinch") is balanced by a deeply felt, earned renunciation. The conflict between thirty years of chasing and the final choice to "let it drown" demonstrates high agency and emotional cost. The internal arc perfectly mirrors the external action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A masterfully structured causal arc. The inciting incident (sleepwalking stars) leads directly to a specific, cost-laden intervention (voicing silence). Closure is definitive: the acceptance of the "hungry" dark is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels inevitable yet earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" is not just backdrop but a physics engine for the story; the fisher digs where the soil *refuses* to hum. Imagery like "teeth made of broken echoes" and "air split like wet silk" creates a vivid, consistent sensory reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled: the "edge of meaning" vs. the personal grief. The escalation—from restless soil to the confrontation with the mimic-mouth—is tight and coherent. The cost is paid in the currency of the story: silence and isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a "hungry" silence rather than a comforting presence lands with power. The final image of the dark smiling back reframes the protagonist's existence without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ requirement for non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, mythic, and controlled. It falters slightly only in rhythmic variety; the reliance on standard subject-verb sentence structures ("He pressed," "He began," "He leaned") creates a staccato cadence that occasionally flattens the tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong but marred by a notable cliché ("hit like a wave") at a pivotal emotional beat. Additionally, a repetitive "He [verb]" sentence pattern in the middle section (digging/confrontation) creates a mechanical rhythm that disrupts the otherwise high-quality flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "sound wave garden" concept with the "fisher" archetype creates a fresh, specific world. The reimagining of constellations as sleepwalking giants adds a unique mythic layer that feels fully integrated rather than ornamental.</comment>
