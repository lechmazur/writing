<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's transition from "restorer" to "door" is a profound internal arc that justifies the external action. The specific trait "accumulating silence" effectively grounds his interaction with the supernatural, and the choice to unravel the net feels earned by his backstory as a failed mender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative structure—unraveling the net knot by knot—perfectly matches the narrative drive. Closure is decisive and resonant: the physical shattering of the prisms and the release of the spirits mark an irreversible state change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not merely atmospheric but active; the prisms' shattering is a key beat in the closure. The sensory details ("stench of kelp," "flame bending like a held breath") vividly anchor the metaphysical stakes in the physical world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is managed well through the physical progress of unraveling and the encroaching sensory pressure of the spirits. The final hesitation at the "knot swollen with seawater" provides a clear, earned moment of agency before the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The thematic subversion—that mending is a lie and letting things fall apart is the truth—is executed with precision. The story avoids a moralizing conclusion, instead offering a complex resonance where the "broken smile" feels like the only honest response.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively blurring the line between the physical and the spectral. A high density of figurative language occasionally threatens to slow momentum, but the control remains strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, though the density of "poetic" modification (e.g., "silk spun from spider’s patience," "tangle of twine and regret") borders on overwriting. The rhythm is excellent, but the relentless adjectival pairing slightly dampens the raw impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mask-maker protagonist with a ghost-release plot via net-unraveling is highly original. The central metaphor of the net as a false promise of peace is a fresh and compelling angle on the restless spirit trope.</comment>
