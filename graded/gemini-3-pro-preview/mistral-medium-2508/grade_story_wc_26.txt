<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora is drawn with a delicate hand, but her defining trait—being "half-empty"—feels like a convenient keyhole designed to fit the plot's lock rather than a source of genuine internal friction. Her decision to sacrifice her shadow lacks an alternative or a moment of hesitation; she moves from realization to resolution with a procedural inevitability that flattens her agency. The "dusk noticer" tag creates an aesthetic but doesn't drive tactical choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the shadow trade) qualifies as a Decisive Change with visible cost. However, the reliance on the video archive beat to deliver exposition slows the middle section, telling us about the shadow's nature rather than dramatizing it in the present moment. The orientation within the library is solid, and the causality holds, though the path to the ending is linear and lacks complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like books "blooming with light." The imagery anchors the magical realism effectively, though it leans on familiar genre tropes (floating library, yellowed parchment). The environment functions well as a container for the story's logic, even if it doesn't strictly constrain the protagonist's tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The stakes are clear—an unbound entity needs a vessel—but the conflict suffers from a lack of opposition. The curator's lie is discovered and discarded in a single beat, and Liora encounters no significant obstacle to her goal; she simply realizes what must be done and does it. The cost is paid, but without a struggle or a "no" moment, the escalation feels smooth rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of preserving hope through sacrifice is legible but undermined by a heavy-handed delivery in the final paragraphs. The narration explicitly summarizes the moral ("Some stories don't need words," "She would tell it like this") instead of trusting the final image to resonate on its own. This explanatory layering dilutes the subtext and reduces the emotional impact of the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a cohesive tone throughout. However, it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("softly deliberate" used as a rhythmic crutch) and slightly overwrought phrasing. The POV control is stable, but the narrative distance feels performed rather than intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose flows well but is marred by several exhausted similes ("hands like yellowed parchment," "curled... like a sleeping cat") that lower the freshness of the imagery. While there are no mechanical loops, the reliance on these clichés prevents the line-level craft from reaching a professional standard of specificity. The rhythm is competent but lacks variation in intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The core elements—a magical library, shadow trading, and materialized emotions—are staples of fantasy fiction and are executed here without a significant subversive twist. The concept of "dusk noticing" offers a glimmer of novelty, but the overall package feels derivative of established genre conventions (e.g., Le Guin, Zafón) rather than a fresh synthesis.</comment>
