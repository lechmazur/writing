<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's obsession is visceral, driving him past horror into a deeper, fatalistic resolve. The shift from "some things aren't meant to be found" to "he would find the ledger" effectively dramatizes the complex irrationality of grief, creating a strong Earned Stasis at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with the "whale" timeframe providing excellent compression for the ritual. Closure lands with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist moves from seeking a specific memory to hunting the mechanism of storage itself, accepting the lethal cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is not just backdrop but physics; the "salt crystal chamber" and "pockets of gravity" actively constrain the ritual and generate the climax. The sensory detail—ozone, old pennies, the clicking hook—grounds the weird elements in tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as a trade-off between safety and the truth of the wife's fate. The escalation is palpable when the stone shifts and the scream manifests; the cost is paid in the destruction of his tools and the traumatic confirmation of her state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "gravity as memory" metaphor is potent and coheres well with the action. The thematic resonance is slightly dampened by the explicit diagnosis ("The doctors called it grief"), but the final image of the "hungry" gravity successfully reweights the concept without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suiting the weird-fiction genre. It maintains a disciplined distance that heightens the loneliness, though it occasionally dips into standard genre phrasing ("shadow with a flame") rather than finding a uniquely sharp idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Information density and rhythm are generally strong, but specific clichés ("slipping like sand through his fingers," "thick as mud") mar the line-level freshness. While the "saltwater hissed" image is strong, the reliance on familiar similes in emotional beats prevents entry into the highest bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elements—whales affecting local gravity, salt crystals as memory storage, and coffee grounds as a divination tool—is remarkably fresh and specific. The weird-fiction premise feels distinct and fully realized, avoiding generic "ghost story" templates.</comment>
