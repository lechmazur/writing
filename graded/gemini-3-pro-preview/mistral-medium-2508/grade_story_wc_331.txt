<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias has a clear motivation (grief/loneliness), but his internal state is resolved through magical externalization rather than character choice or interpersonal friction. The trait "sanely eccentric" is applied as a label rather than dramatized through specific behavior or constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving from setup to ritual to resolution. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (he becomes a "crease"), but the causality relies on "magic system" mechanics that function without resistance or unexpected cost, lowering the narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "scientific poetry library" is a vivid, specific setting that grounds the abstract concepts. Details like specific book titles and the "restricted section" add texture, though some sensory descriptions ("liquid amber") lean toward cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conflict is largely static; Elias faces no antagonist or significant obstacle preventing the ritual. The escalation is atmospheric ("air thickened") rather than a tightening of options or rising stakes. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory as geometry is consistent and resolves in the final image of the child. However, the emotional resonance relies heavily on stated sentiment ("stories are just shapes") rather than subtextual emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from "poetic" affectation. Phrases like "satellites orbiting a forgotten planet" feel like standard literary workshop tropes rather than a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten with dense, sometimes mixed metaphors ("listen with the shape of your bones," "fossil of fleeting clarity"). Reliance on stock imagery ("liquid amber," "equations like incantations") obscures clarity and reduces impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept of the library is imaginative, but the execution follows a familiar "magic books come to life" trajectory. The "geometry" angle adds flavor but functions indistinguishably from standard magic.</comment>
