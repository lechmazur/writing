<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eldrin’s internal arc from rigid preservationist to adaptive mapkeeper is distinct and earns the ending. The conceptual cost—accepting the erasure of the "library" he swore to protect—is legible, though the physical toll is somewhat generic ("fingers trembled").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A clean Situational arc that lands a solid Resonant Reconfiguration; the shift from storm to conversation recontextualizes the threat effectively. The resolution relies on the antagonists’ rapid acquiescence, which feels slightly convenient but fits the fable logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the action; the ice fractures and ripple-marks function as necessary tools that constrain Eldrin’s method. The sensory focus on vibration and tactile sound grounds the abstract magic system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Escalation is present via the cracking ice and the beings' pressure, but the pivot to harmony resolves the external threat with minimal friction. The "cost" is primarily the loss of the caves' history, which charges the final image nicely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of silence as an invitation rather than a weapon is sophisticated and organically integrated. The "bloom of hush" functions as a resonant metaphor that resolves the central conflict without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and firmly anchored in Eldrin’s sensory experience. The lyrical tone suits the material, maintaining a fable-like distance while keeping the POV distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are generally strong, but occasional sentimental metaphors ("breath curling... like a question mark," stone "as if nodding") border on twee. These artifacts distract slightly from an otherwise polished surface.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of "first contact" and elemental magic tropes, distinguished by the specific mechanics of reading ice. The concept of "mapping silence" feels inventive, though the "misunderstood alien" resolution is a familiar beat.</comment>
