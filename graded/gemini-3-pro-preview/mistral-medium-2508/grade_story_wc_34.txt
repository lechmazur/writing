<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—translating silence into code—is established early and drives the central conflict. The backstory of the grandmother is seamlessly integrated to ground the climax, turning a memory into a tactical tool (the bolt plate). The internal shift from curiosity to defensive rejection is sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causality is tight; the "ghost" responds directly to the encoded provocations, leading to a clear climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the immediate threat is silenced, but the ending image of the child implies a cyclical cost. The "server room" metaphor effectively bridges the magical and technical logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vivid and specific, blending the archaic (cobblestones, parchment) with the conceptual (server room, ozone). The sensory details ("wet silk," "static hum") effectively ground the surreal premise, though the "ghost of rain" description leans slightly ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined: the danger of the "unspoken" manifesting as a hungry entity. The escalation is rapid but coherent, moving from communication to a threat of possession. The cost is felt in the "raw throat" and the weight of the enforced silence, adhering to the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus release is strong, but the ending falters with explicit summarization ("The work was never really done"). This thematic echo in the final moments flattens the resonance of the otherwise powerful image of the child, triggering a penalty for explanatory moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical texture that suits the "balladeer" persona. Narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping close to the protagonist’s perceptions while managing the surreal elements without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high with strong imagery ("voice like a child’s fingers brushing piano keys"). However, there is a slight reliance on standard rhetorical constructions ("Not in words, but in...", "Not in sound, but in...") that creates a repetitive cadence at key moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of folklore (flower pressing, balladeer) with cyber-conceptual imagery (encoding, server room, glitching reality) is highly ingenious. It transforms the "ghost story" trope into something fresh and structurally unique.</comment>
