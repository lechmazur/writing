<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s sensory experience of deafness is grounded and evocative, particularly the tactile focus on vibration. However, the backstory of the "boy’s sneer" feels stock, and his emotional pivot—from total despair to renewed purpose—resolves too rapidly after a single external intervention, lacking a graduated struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scene flows with a clear arc from isolation to connection, and the closure effectively reconfigures the meaning of the broken needle. However, the resolution relies on a "magical object" handed to a passive protagonist rather than an outcome earned through active tactical choice or ingenuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern is rendered with excellent sensory specificity, prioritizing touch and smell over sight, which aligns perfectly with the protagonist’s POV. The atmosphere effectively mirrors the internal state, though the timeline of "seasons turning" outside blurs the immediate scene anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the protagonist lacks agency in the climax; he merely accepts the record the drum maker offers and listens. The conflict resolves through an external gift rather than a costly decision or renunciation forced by rising pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding value in brokenness is legible but undermined by explicit moralizing at the end ("Some things... are only true backward"). The text explains its own subtext via dialogue and summary, significantly reducing the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, handling the signing dialogue smoothly. The tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("ghost of rhythms not yet born"), but the mood remains cohesive and appropriate for the fable-like quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with good rhythm, but suffers from forced poetic phrasings like "audibly muted" and "filament of hush" that draw attention to themselves. The metaphorical stacking in the final paragraph ("numbness... wall... door") feels slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of tactile "backward songs" offers a fresh specific, but the setup—a wise elder in a cave dispensing magical healing objects—is a familiar trope. The "magical shop" structure limits the sense of genuine risk or novelty despite the unique sensory details.</comment>
