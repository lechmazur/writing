<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct, atmospheric focalizer, and his shift from observer to intervener is clear. However, the interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("space where doubt lived") rather than specific, grounded emotion, making him feel slightly archetypal rather than deeply human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean, coherent movement toward a state of Charged Poise. The closure—stepping forward while mirrors shatter—effectively dramatizes the internal decision, satisfying the requirement for a decisive change even within a preparatory scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific, with the "gnarled apple trees" and "smell of wax and damp wool" grounding the fantastical elements. The juxtaposition of the orchard and the ice floes creates a strong, constrained atmosphere that serves the story's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (the girl's safety vs. Elias's passive nature), and the pressure escalates internally. While the external threat is pending rather than immediate, the shattering of the mirrors provides a legible, felt cost to the protagonist's choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of active empathy is coherent and resonant, though articulated somewhat didactically ("To reconstitute it... would require more than skill"). The story tells the reader the meaning of the choice rather than letting it emerge solely through subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. The psychic distance is stable, maintaining a close focus on Elias's perceptions without unmotivated head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from a high density of similes ("like old men," "like trapped screams," "like loose thread," "like bones"), creating a scaffolded rhythm. This over-reliance on "like/as" constructions dulls the immediacy of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of the lighthouse, the orchard, and the crystal visions offers a fresh take on the "seer" archetype. The specific imagery elevates the concept above standard fantasy tropes, though the "brave child" element is familiar.</comment>
