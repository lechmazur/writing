<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lena is a functional protagonist with a clear desire, but her internal life relies on stock physical markers ("breath hitched," "hands shook") rather than specific, embodied interiority. While the choice to join the archive is motivated, the emotional transition feels rushed, relying on the prop (patch) more than deep psychological pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a legible "Resonant Reconfiguration" at closure. However, the mechanism of the numbers appearing in the physical world (frost, coffee cup) clashes with the established "neural lace"/server farm sci-fi reality without sufficient grounding, reading as a convenient genre shift to horror logic to force the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting of the "data grave" is atmospheric, effectively using light and sound to build a ghostly digital tone. However, the imagery is occasionally repetitive (using "star" similes twice for high-impact descriptions) and some descriptions lean into cyberpunk clichés ("confetti across the Kuiper Belt").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are high and clearly communicated; the escalation from investigation to system override to termination flows logically. The final cost—erasure of the self to preserve memory—is a "Decisive Change" that lands with genuine weight, satisfying the pressure built throughout the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of corporate erasure versus human persistence is coherent and resonant. While slightly on-the-nose in moments ("They unwrote us"), the ending integrates the theme well, transforming the "curator of silence" into a part of the "song."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffers from a staccato rhythm caused by excessive vertical spacing (many one-sentence paragraphs). This fragmentation feels like an artificial attempt to induce tension and results in a "screenplay" feel rather than a textured literary narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose density is compromised by the paragraphing choice, which breaks momentum and creates a jerky reading experience. Line-level craft shows reliance on stock phrasing ("ghost-light," "angry stars") and vague action ("slotted the crystal... and pulled"—pulled what?), lacking the precision required for the highest echelon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story executes a familiar cyberpunk/dystopian trope (the ghost in the machine, the archive that lies) with competence but little structural or conceptual innovation. The "numbers haunting the protagonist" is a standard genre device that plays out predictably.</comment>
