<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lena is a consistent, atmospheric focalizer with a clear past and distinct method ("patchwork navigator"). However, the emotional shift at the end ("weight in her chest felt lighter") feels asserted rather than earned by a specific, high-stakes choice made in this particular scene; she performs a routine ritual without a unique pressure spike to justify the sudden change in state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative functions as a well-composed vignette under a Situational lens, establishing a ritual and executing it. The closure (finding "raw solace") is tonally coherent but structurally soft; the story does not dramatize *why* this specific iteration of the routine triggers a breakthrough that years of identical nights did not, leaving the epiphany relying on authorial assertion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric grounding with tactile details like the "warped floorboards" and the "greenish bloom" of the censer. The setting actively mirrors the protagonist's internal decay and reconstruction, effectively functioning as an extension of character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily thematic rather than dramatic; the midnight call is established as a cyclical routine rather than a disrupting event. There is no immediate, escalated threat or obstacle in this specific beat that forces Lena to adapt or pay a new cost, making the stakes feel abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "geography of loss" and "reverse migration" metaphors are woven seamlessly into the action of map-making. The theme of repurposing grief into direction is resonant and lands clearly in the final image of building/anchoring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, suiting the gothic maritime tone. The transition between the present moment and the "hydraulics fail" backstory is smooth, maintaining a stable POV distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic but relies on several genre clichés ("rough as gravel," "ghosts of transmissions," "breathing" patina). While the imagery is dense, it occasionally prioritizes familiar poeticisms over fresh, specific observation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "spectral lighthouse keeper" is a familiar trope, but the specific details of the "patchwork" methodology and the "censer foot" as a tool add a layer of fresh texture. The concept of "reverse migration" for the dead offers a nice conceptual twist on the standard ghost story.</comment>
