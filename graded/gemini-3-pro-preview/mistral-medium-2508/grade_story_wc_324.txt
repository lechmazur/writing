<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation shifts from professional curiosity to personal revelation, but the protagonist's failure to recognize his own mother requires convenient amnesia. Embodiment relies on stock phrasing ("breath came shallow," "knees hit the stone") rather than specific sensory experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The scene is structurally sound and linear, delivering a clear closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the central twist relies on the "smudged face" trope to withhold information artificially, and the causality of the mist/glove mechanic is dream-logic rather than defined.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Specific details like "pennies left on a corpse’s eyes" and "jagged blues" create a distinct atmosphere. However, the atrium itself functions mostly as a backdrop; the environment doesn't force tactical shifts or constrain movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pressure is atmospheric rather than urgent; the "mist" implies a threat but does not force a hard trade-off or active defense. The protagonist faces no significant opposition, resolving the conflict by simply walking forward and touching an object.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing versus forgetting is coherent and lands in the final image ("For when you forget"). The execution is functional but leans heavily on familiar tropes of memory and ghosts without subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a melancholic, atmospheric tone. Psychic distance is generally controlled, though the "he wasn't a hero" refrain feels slightly heavy-handed by the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by cliché clusters in high-stakes moments ("mist screamed," "knees hit the stone," "breath came shallow"). "Fracturing twilight" works, but the melodrama in physical reactions weakens the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise combines familiar elements (ghost hunter with tech, "it was me all along" twist) without a fresh synthesis. The execution is competent but follows a very standard "retrieving lost memory" template.</comment>
