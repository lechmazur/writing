<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lena’s agency drives every beat; she transforms from victim to active "perturbation" through a sequence of high-stakes choices. The internal arc—refusing to fix the past in favor of witnessing its potential—is sophisticated and earns the emotional shift at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality is tight, with a clear drive lens linking the heist-like backstory to the present crisis. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist reframes her trauma with visible emotional cost, though the logistics of her transition from "finding coordinates" to "Subject 7" are slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric, actively constraining the action through the storm and cooling breakers. While imagery like "steel ribs" and "burnt sugar" leans toward genre standards, the "splinter in the sky" and specific interaction with the console ground the scene effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate and layered, balancing the physical danger of the collapsing field with the profound emotional weight of the "unmade past." The climax is driven entirely by Lena's refusal to heed warnings, resulting in a decisive, non-trivial internal victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of "hunting potential" rather than spending it is woven masterfully into the narrative logic. The story avoids the easy trope of changing the past, instead landing a complex insight about the weight of unmade choices that resonates well beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, blending scientific terminology with lyric grief ("equation bled," "violence of knowing"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Lena’s perception, enhancing the emotional impact of the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and strong rhythm. A few descriptions ("burnt sugar and copper") are minor genre clichés, but lines like "lightning stitching the ruins" and the final "chorus of protest" demonstrate high craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard sci-fi concepts (perturbation theory) with a raw, personal narrative of grief is handled with ingenuity. The subversion of the time-travel "fix-it" trope in favor of a witness-based resolution feels fresh and earned.</comment>
