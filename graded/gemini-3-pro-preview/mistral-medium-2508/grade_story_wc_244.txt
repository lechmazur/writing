<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena is a competent focalizer with a distinct "logistician" worldview that colors her actions (fixing the radio, trading leverage). However, she lacks internal conflict; she accepts the twist and the thematic lesson instantly without struggle, acting more as a fable archetype than a psychologically deepened character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from arrival to investigation to revelation and departure with clear causality. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the nature of the "cure" is repriced, though the ease of the protagonist's acceptance lowers the dramatic tension slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "stubborn ghosts of timetables" and "boots crunching on glass" grounding the fable-like tone. The environment actively shapes the plot, serving as both the obstacle and the resource for Lena’s trade-based tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the cure) is clear, but the obstacles (broken radio, dehydrated blacksmith) are overcome too easily by Lena's competence. The climax—a revelation that the doctor is a poet—is accepted without resistance, lacking the friction or high-stakes dilemma required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity and connection is coherent, but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("The cure wasn’t in the holding. It was in the passing") rather than letting the action speak for itself. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is confident, polished, and maintains a consistent slightly lyrical register suitable for the fable-like content. Narrative distance is controlled, and the dialogue fits the stylized atmosphere without breaking character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("swallowing its own echoes"), though occasionally leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("cold as a promise"). The rhythm is strong, and line-level craft supports the atmospheric tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a logistician in a post-collapse fable trading a moon rock for a metaphysical cure is fresh and well-executed. While it touches on familiar tropes of the "traveling healer/trader," the specific synthesis of elements feels distinct.</comment>
