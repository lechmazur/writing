<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coachman is consistent and atmospheric, serving as a functional vessel for the theme. However, he lacks the contradictory impulses or internal friction required for higher bands; his motivation is static, and his actions (planting, listening) face no significant internal opposition or costly choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative flow is smooth under an Accumulative lens, but the closure relies on a summary time-jump ("Years later...") to validate the action rather than crystallizing the change in the scene's present moment. This "epilogue" approach weakens the immediate structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, specific sensory details ("silt of drowned things," "humming faintly") that ground the abstract theme. The jetty and the "broken rib" imagery effectively constrain the action and establish the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story operates as a vignette with low active pressure; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the task, or himself. The ritual is performed without obstruction or escalation, resulting in a flat dramatic arc despite the high thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of healing and memory is clear but handled explicitly, bordering on moralizing. The ending ("And the garden would remember. It always did.") acts as a Thematic Echo that summarizes the thesis rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent Gothic lyricism that fits the subject matter. While effective, the register occasionally drifts into slight overwriting with heavy adjectival phrasing ("bruised sky," "stubborn green fingers") that calls attention to itself.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. However, the density of similes in the opening paragraphs ("like a broken rib," "like smoke," "sharp as flint") creates a textural thickness that slightly slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of a gardener healing a battlefield is poignant but familiar. The execution is competent, yet the specific elements (the weary watchman, the time-skip validation) rely on established tropes without a distinct, subversive turn.</comment>
