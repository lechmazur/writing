<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation to process grief through craft is clear and sustained. The internal shift from "containing" the husband to accepting his absence is legible, though the pivotal realization feels slightly unearned by the immediate scene pressure, relying instead on a dream.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent with a distinct closure unit (keeping the carving), but the causal link relies on a dream sequence to provide the solution rather than waking agency. Orientation and pacing are solid, though the brevity rushes the emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details—the smell of cedar, the rain on glass, the ash wood—effectively ground the abstract grief. The skylight and rain serve as a functional atmospheric constraint that mirrors the internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internalized (artistic honesty vs. commercial hollow promises). The confrontation with the girl provides a necessary external pressure, though the cost of the final decision (loss of income vs. peace) remains largely conceptual rather than concretely felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("lesson harvested from loss"). The story explains its meaning directly to the reader rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, limiting the subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans heavily into "workshop" register ("language of absence," "crystallized time"). The tone matches the melancholic content, though the metaphor density occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Polished but overwritten in places; phrases like "violation of its wholeness" and "shape of things she would never name" trade concrete impact for vague abstraction. The simile comparing a match strike to a lion's yawn strains physical logic for the sake of motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A competent execution of a familiar literary trope (grief processed through art). While the imagery is specific, the emotional trajectory and the "learning to let go" conclusion follow a standard path without a surprising synthesis or fresh risk.</comment>
