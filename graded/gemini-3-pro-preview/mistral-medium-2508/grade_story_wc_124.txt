<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s arc is defined by a clear shift from preservation to destruction. His initial "aromatic caution" effectively establishes a constraint that he breaks to trigger the climax. While the "bitter and soft" laugh borders on melodramatic cliché, his decision to smash the lanterns and leave creates a high-cost, earned resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal chain is strong: the scent triggers tears, the tears physically feed the plant (observed on page), leading to the realization. Closure is decisive and costly (abandoning his trade and home). The epiphany is dramatized through action rather than just internal monologue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is an active participant, trapping the "breath of forgotten things" and providing the UV context for the reveal. The contrast between the "dying glow" inside and the "harsh, alive" dawn outside effectively charges the final transition. The setting actively constraints and shapes the epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stakes are intimate but high—Elias’s connection to his mother vs. his own survival. The escalation from "tending" to "feeding" to "abandoning" is coherent. The cost of his freedom is the destruction of his livelihood and the shrine to his mother, which is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a parasitic force is well-handled through the flower metaphor. However, the ending summarizes the theme explicitly ("some smells were doors... and he, at last, had stopped walking through them"), which reduces the resonance by explaining the metaphor rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistently atmospheric and melancholic, fitting the gothic tone. The sensory focus (scent and light) is well-controlled. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing ("scents were thieves") that draws attention to itself, but it generally serves the story.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and sensory-rich, but relies on stock phrases at peak moments ("hit him like a blade," "laugh, bitter and soft"). The line "The transformation was complete" is a "telling" artifact that flattens a pivotal beat. Rhythm is generally good, but the "template cadence" of noun-verb imagery is visible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of flowers feeding on the ultraviolet spectrum of grief/tears is a fresh, specific synthesis of the prompt elements. The inversion of the "healing garden" trope into something parasitic adds a nice layer of ingenuity.</comment>
