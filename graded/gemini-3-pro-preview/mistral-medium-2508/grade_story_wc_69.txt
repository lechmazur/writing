<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias is a strongly realized focal point, his internal landscape of loss rendered with specificity ("tracing the carved edges"). The supporting cast, while functionally distinct, relies on trauma-shorthand ("bullet-scarred folder," "tremor") that leans toward archetypal efficiency rather than deep characterization. The emotional logic of their return is sound, and the collective shift from singing to humming feels earned by their shared fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean Accumulative arc, gathering the remnants of the choir to a singular point of focus. Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; they do not fix the music but find a new way to inhabit the silence ("listening to the cracks"). The transition from the backstory of conflict to the present stillness is smooth, though the vibrating rosette at the end risks a touch of unearned sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with the "velvet library" and "amber" light creating a vivid container for the scene. The rosette functions excellently as a micro-setting, grounding abstract themes of loss in "lacewood petals" and "old honey." The integration of the autumn season mirrors the narrative arc of stripping down to essentials.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stakes are communal and emotional, elevated by the "bullet-scarred folder" which implies a backdrop of civil strife. However, the central conflict (the arguments that broke the choir) is summarized in backstory rather than dramatized in the present, which lowers the immediate on-page pressure. The resolution—a shift in tactics from song to presence—successfully addresses the stakes of survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "subtracting noise" effectively braids the physical object (the rosette) with the narrative resolution. The story avoids a simplistic "music heals all" moral by acknowledging that the choir is irrevocably broken ("remnants"), opting for a more complex and honest thematic conclusion about endurance. The subtext of political or sectarian division ("whose pain deserved to be heard") adds necessary gravity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, suiting the "autumn" and "library" motifs. The rhythm is controlled, slowing appropriately during the singers' arrival to emphasize their fragility. There is a slight tendency toward poetic abstraction ("unlearned people") that distances the reader momentarily, but the narrative stance remains confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjectival stacking ("expectantly resigned sigh") and mixed metaphors ("bleeding amber... like slow fire"). While the sensory details are evocative, the density of figurative language sometimes draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The integration of required phrases is generally smooth, though "denote" feels slightly academic in context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "silent choir" gathering in a library offers a fresh, quiet take on the post-conflict reunion trope. Using the rosette as a totem for the missing music is an ingenious specific detail that anchors the sentimentality. The ending avoids the cliché of a miraculous full-voiced recovery, maintaining tonal integrity.</comment>
