<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Liora serves as a functional catalyst for the fable but lacks internal contradiction or struggle; she is certain from the start and faces no doubt. The specific prompt phrase "heuristically gentle" is used as a backstory label rather than a dramatized trait in the present, creating a "tell" that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on summary ("By morning," "By the third day") to bridge the inciting incident and climax, bypassing the necessary scene work of the struggle. The resolution is a "symmetric satisfaction" reset (the bakery simply returns) which erases the problem's weight rather than exacting a visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, effectively blending the surreal (backward river) with sensory grounding (scent of yeast, cold copper). The setting of the abandoned tea house provides a solid anchor, though the rapid passage of time dilutes the sense of immediate physical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The conflict is theoretical rather than dramatized; the antagonist (the city's adjustment) yields instantly to Liora's actions without pushback. The guards, the man, and the prince all succumb to the bread immediately, resulting in a linear progression of successes with no moment where the outcome is in doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but articulated through explicit "diagnostic label-speak" ("That was the creeping horror... not the strangeness itself") rather than emerging purely from action. The ending offers a tidy moral resolution ("coins... felt like enough") that feels slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, maintaining a gentle, melancholic rhythm. However, the required technical phrase "heuristically gentle" creates a sharp register break, disrupting the established fairy-tale tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is polished, with strong rhythm and sound ("unspooling like a memory"). A few images lean on cliché ("riot of wheat," "skeletal trees"), but the prose generally supports the magical realist tone effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The piece executes standard fable tropes (magical food healing a gray world) competently but plays it safe. The "magic gardening" logic is a nice touch, but the overall arc follows a predictable path of restoration without subversion.</comment>
