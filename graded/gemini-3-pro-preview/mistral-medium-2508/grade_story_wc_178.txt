<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's "frugal" nature is distinct and shapes his physical movement and initial worldview effectively. However, the internal pivot from empiricism to faith occurs largely in summary ("Qishti laughed... Of course"), lacking the dramatized struggle or contradictory impulses required for a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's worldview—lands clearly. However, the central complication (decoding the tile) is elided ("For three nights"), and the "lock" mechanism feels convenient, reducing the sense of earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is a primary strength; details like the "cracked mosaic" and the "warm" tile ground the scene physically and sensually. The setting actively constrains the protagonist's movement (avoiding guards), though the specific "Babylonian" elements are somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>External pressure is low; the guards are a background condition rather than an active threat, and the puzzle offers no resistance. The narrative relies entirely on curiosity, lacking a "moment of truth" where the protagonist must pay a visible cost to proceed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of science versus devotion is coherent but resolves via explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("some devotions are too vast for numbers"). This "Thematic Echo" replaces scene pressure with a summary statement, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. The distance control is steady, though the shift to internal summary at the climax distances the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally high-quality with strong imagery ("split like a fruit"), but is marred by occasional stock phrasing ("drunk on power," "waited centuries to exhale"). The abstract phrasing of emotions ("empirically ironic thrill") acts as a scaffold rather than a dramatized state.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of a scholar unlocking ancient secrets in a ruined palace is a familiar trope. While the "frugal" character angle adds a slight fresh texture, the execution follows a standard path without a surprising conceptual twist.</comment>
