<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's internal conflict—inherited logic vs. intuitive risk—is distinct and drives the narrative arc. Her motivation to find answers tracks clearly from the inciting health crisis, though the transition to "ready to place a bet" relies heavily on internal monologue rather than dramatized pressure in the moment. The emotional logic holds, grounding the magical leap in character history.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative moves cleanly through a linear arc with a clear closure unit (Decisive Change). However, the causality relies on "instruction manual" plotting (the scrawls dictate the next move), which reduces protagonist agency until the final decision to "not choose." The closure is legible, but the mechanics of the lantern feel convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details are specific and evocative ("wet paper and old glue," "fractured into a dozen jagged reflections"). The atmosphere of the library effectively mirrors Lila's internal state. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, shifting from a place of study to a threshold of the surreal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (safety/father's way vs. risk/new way), and the narrative escalates through a failed first attempt that raises the physical cost ("palms stinging"). While the internal tension is high, the external obstacles are somewhat passive; the library yields to her actions without significant resistance until the final threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of probability versus faith is coherent, but the execution is overly explicit. Using italicized internal monologue to state the thesis directly ("What if the responsible thing is to leap?") flattens the subtext. The story tells the reader the meaning rather than letting it emerge solely from the action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately atmospheric. The close third-person perspective filters the world effectively through Lila's analytical-yet-yearning worldview ("luck was just a lazy word for incomplete data"). The tone manages the transition from sterile medical anxiety to magical realism smoothly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Occasionally, metaphors become slightly overwrought ("pressed it between their palms in apology"), and the compound adjective "clover-melancholy" feels ornamental. Generally, the line-level craft supports the story's ethereal tone well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of stochastic math and portal fantasy offers a fresh intellectual texture to a familiar trope. While the "magical library" setup is standard, framing the magic through the lens of probability errors ("contradictions") adds a layer of specific ingenuity that elevates the concept.</comment>
