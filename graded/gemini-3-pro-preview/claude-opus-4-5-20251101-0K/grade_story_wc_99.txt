<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mei functions primarily as a recipient of the resolution rather than an active agent; she accepts the artifacts and the reconciliation without internal resistance or distinct micro-choices. Her emotions are described ("furious," "drowning") rather than dramatized through friction in the present moment. The grandmother’s struggle is significant but mediated entirely through the tutor and the object.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, moving clearly from arrival to resolution, but the closure relies on a magical convenient device (the lace code) that bypasses the difficulty of communication. The "Decisive Change" (reconciliation) lands softly without a visible "felt cost" for the protagonist; the solution is handed to her rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atmospheric details of the wet islet and mist are vivid and establish a mood of melancholic quiet. However, the use of "cerulean light" feels forced for a misty/storm-aftermath setting, creating a slight sensory dissonance driven by the prompt requirement rather than environmental logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tension is low; the protagonist, the antagonist (silence), and the facilitator (Tanaka) all share the same goal from the start, removing friction. The resolution is effectively guaranteed once the lace is handed over, lacking the escalation or "tightening" of options required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken apology is consistent and touches on the prompt's motivation effectively. However, the execution leans into sentimentality ("Knots that meant regret"), explaining the emotional resonance rather than letting it emerge organically from the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. It occasionally drifts into breathless poetics ("unfurling like a careful leaf") that distance the reader from the visceral reality of the stroke.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with clear imagery, though it suffers from some overwriting ("calcify into years," "diffuse through the pattern"). The forced inclusion of "rhythmically placid whisper" results in a clunky, adverb-heavy construction that disrupts the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story relies on familiar tropes of magical realism—the wise old tutor, the magical object that points to the truth, and the healing power of silence. While competent, the central conceit of the "lace language" feels like a convenient device rather than a fresh structural innovation.</comment>
