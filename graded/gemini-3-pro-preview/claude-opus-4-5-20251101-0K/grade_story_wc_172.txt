<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Eleanor is a compelling contradiction, though her "amoral" nature is established largely through expository summary rather than present-scene action. The physical detail of "trembling hands" at the end effectively grounds her internal conflict in the body. The transition from ruthless calculator to sentimental preservationist feels slightly abrupt but is earned by the ritual itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The single-scene structure is solid, with the approaching storm providing a functional ticking clock that drives the ritual to completion. The backstory regarding the drought halts momentum in the middle third but successfully contextualizes the irony of the rain's return. Closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the timing of the rain feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and tactile, particularly the "crystalline crust" and the salt dissolving around her knees. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active force that interacts with the protagonist and the prop (the speaker). The atmosphere of "bruised" skies and "crystalline silence" perfectly supports the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving a legacy against oblivion—is clear, and the sacrifice of the valuable egg provides a tangible on-page cost. However, the conflict is primarily internal and retrospective; the external pressure (the storm) is atmospheric rather than an active opposition that forces difficult tactical choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central concept of the "mathematics of mercy" is strong, but the ending is weakened by explicit moralizing that explains the theme ("love and destruction were sometimes the same gesture"). This explanatory thematic echo in the final paragraph collapses the ambiguity that the action itself had successfully built. The resonance is present but muffled by the narrator's intrusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently elevated and cynical, fitting Eleanor's self-perception as a "villain who saved the world." POV control is tight, staying firmly within her interpretative framework even during the backstory segments. The tone manages to be both grandiose and intimate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished with strong rhythmic control and evocative phrasing like "patient as geology." A few images falter, such as the tautological cliché "falling into blackness like light into a black hole," which distracts from the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft. Sentence variety and density are otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological engineering, billionaire guilt, and acoustic preservation creates a fresh and memorable premise. The specific image of broadcasting extinct bird calls into a sealed underground cavern is a unique and haunting transformation of the time-capsule trope.</comment>
