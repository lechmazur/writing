<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vera is remarkably grounded; her profession is not just a label but mapped onto her body ("pale lines... earned from decades"). Her interiority is physically embodied (teeth aching from sound, the "hammered repose"), and her motivation to find silence drives every micro-choice, culminating in a decision that redefines her purpose from charter to guardian.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is seamless, moving from the inciting pressure of the noise to the specific, skill-based discovery of the chamber. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts her smaller territory, transforming from a mapkeeper of the whole to a guardian of the refuge. The causal link via the ice patterns is precise and rewarding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is an active participant, constraining action (noise barriers) and enabling solutions (acoustic geology). The description of the "frozen waves" and "crystalline growths" is vivid, and the environment’s physics (sound vs. silence) provide the central tension. The bloom of hush is realized as a tangible, physical space rather than just an idea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The external pressure (energy beings’ noise) is constant and effectively creates a survival-stakes atmosphere without needing a direct antagonist. The escalation through the "groaning" caves to the "spiral formation" keeps the tension tight. The stakes are personal sanity and professional identity, which feel significant and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation—finding a new function in a broken world—is resonant. The shift from mapping for exploration to mapping for shelter offers a mature, nuanced take on the "invasion" trope. The silence is treated with reverence, elevating the concept of "hush" to a spiritual necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, employing a lexicon that fits the mapkeeper persona ("resonated," "frequencies," "geometry"). The psychic distance is intimate, staying close to Vera’s sensory experience. The tone balances technical observation with lyrical desperation effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally high-caliber with strong sensory density ("notes that made her teeth ache"). However, the repetition of the specific phrase "gently luminous" (once for the sphere, once for warmth) within a short span reads as a prompt-force artifact rather than organic description. This slight redundancy prevents a higher score in this category.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "sound mapkeeper" facing "noise beings" is a fresh, specific inversion of standard alien tropes. The resolution—seeking the "eye of the storm" rather than fighting or fleeing—feels distinct and conceptually mature. The "bloom of hush" is a memorable, original concept.</comment>
