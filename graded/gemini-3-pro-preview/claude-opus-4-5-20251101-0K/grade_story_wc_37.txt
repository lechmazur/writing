<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s arc creates a poignant trajectory with a visible, high cost (loss of self), creating strong emotional resonance. Her agency is slightly diluted when the pivotal swaddling action is described as "instinctive" rather than a conscious derivation, but her choice to endure and complete the ritual redeems the beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist is fundamentally altered and the world state changes with clear causality. The opening third is somewhat static and exposition-heavy, but the narrative drive tightens significantly once the interaction with the windows begins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mica windows serve as a fantastic specific element, grounding the abstract concept of "memory" in a tangible, interactive object that constrains and enables the protagonist. The atmospheric pressure of the "endless night" is felt as a physical weight on the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and escalate effectively from personal memory loss to the survival of the realm. The external pressure of the darkness "sensing threat" provides a necessary active opposition to the protagonist’s ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory superseding individual identity is woven seamlessly into the plot and mechanics. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fable-like tone is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a stable distance. However, the score is capped due to the syntactic monotony and stock phrasing identified in Q7, which flattens the voice's distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose relies on stock metaphors ("insects in amber," "water through cupped fingers") and suffers from a repetitive "She [verb]" sentence structure that creates a monotonous drumbeat rhythm. While clear, the writing lacks the fresh textural density required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The specific image of swaddling windows with petals to catch light is highly original and successfully transforms the familiar "singing magic" trope. The synthesis of memory, light, and weaving creates a fresh conceptual landscape.</comment>
