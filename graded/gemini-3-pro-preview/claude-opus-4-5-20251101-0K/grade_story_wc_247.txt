<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is legible, and the "ghost" dynamic is compelling, but the relationship lacks necessary friction; the immediate, frictionless alignment between Mira and Elena bypasses genuine interpersonal struggle. Internal states are often summarized with diagnostic labels ("joy at finally being witnessed") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and causality holds, but the pivotal "teaching" beat is handled via summary montage ("Through the night, they worked...") rather than a dramatized scene. This softens the pacing and elides the mechanism of change, leaving the resolution feeling slightly unearned despite the logical setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory grounding defines the piece; the "liquid silver" harbor and "vibrations through the floorboards" effectively charge the atmosphere. The setting actively shapes the mood and the "silence" concept, acting as a third character that anchors the abstract themes in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Escalation is weak; the story relies on a "help me" request followed by immediate compliance and success, lacking a meaningful reversal or moment of doubt. The conflict is entirely external (the off-page council), while the on-page scene proceeds without testing the characters' commitment or forcing a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of translating silence is resonant but heavy-handed, often articulated explicitly in dialogue ("translate silence into music") rather than emerging from subtext. The emotional thesis is delivered via narrator explanation ("joyful sorrow of possibility") rather than allowing the reader to infer meaning from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the atmospheric intent, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("symphony," "carrying silence like a torch"). Dialogue is polished and poetic but lacks naturalistic texture, sounding more like written manifestos than spoken interaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but suffers from "telling" emotional states directly ("joy at finally being witnessed") instead of showing them. While free of mechanical errors, the reliance on abstract noun phrases to carry emotional weight reduces the visceral impact of the line-level work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a deaf photographer mapping silence is a fresh and poetic angle on the preservation trope. However, the execution leans on familiar sentimental beats ("two ghosts remembered each other"), preventing the story from reaching a truly unexpected or risky synthesis.</comment>
