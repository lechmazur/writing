<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira’s internal drive is clear, but the emotional resolution relies heavily on witnessing an expository conversation rather than active interrogation of the mystery. The mother's dialogue in the flashback ("The green resonance crystals filter it") reads as functional info-dumping rather than natural speech under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a convenient coincidence—the "cyclical surge" happening exactly when needed—and resolves via a vision that explains the backstory completely. While the final choice (entering the rift) provides closure, the mechanism of discovery is passive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "cathedral to obsolescence" and specific details like "lipstick stains" create a tangible, melancholic atmosphere. The sensory mapping concept is well-integrated with the physical description of the derelict bay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are raised by the "toxicity" reveal, but the conflict is largely internal and resolved instantly upon receiving the new information. The threat of death is stated but not tested or struggled against on the page before the final decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of sacrificial love is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing at the end ("The weight of truth... wasn't a burden") rather than letting the action carry the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "sensory" focus. However, the dialogue in the flashback scene is stiff and expository, breaking the immersion of the parallel world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some imagery works well, but phrasing is occasionally awkward or grammatically rough ("manifested cyclically spontaneous" should likely be "spontaneously"). There is a tendency toward abstract, slightly purple descriptions ("gravitational pull from the withheld").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "sensory map maker" is an engaging concept, but the core narrative arc—a child discovering a missing parent sacrificed themselves to protect them/the world—is a familiar genre trope executed standardly.</comment>
