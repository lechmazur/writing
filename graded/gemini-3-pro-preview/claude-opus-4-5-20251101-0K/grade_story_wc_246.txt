<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vera is a compelling protagonist with deep, embodied interiority. The tension between her guilt and her professional duty is palpable, and the transition from "punishing herself" to "editing history" is earned through specific memories of her mentor. The attribute "confidently uncertain" is well-integrated into her decision-making process, though the phrase itself repeats slightly too often.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative executes a complex time-loop concept with admirable clarity; the inciting incident (the message arrival) and the climax (the correction) are distinct and causally linked via the established logic of the anomaly. Closure is decisive and resonant, with the "unbending" offering a satisfying mechanism for the resolution. The ending creates a legible "after" state for the universe and the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the gravitational anomaly's properties directly enable the climax. Sensory details like time folding "like wet paper" and the "dried-up fountain pen" ground the high-concept sci-fi in tactile reality. The environment effectively mirrors Vera's internal stasis and eventual shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are massive (the fate of a civilization) yet grounded in personal redemption. The pressure escalates cleanly from the arrival of the signal to the immediate need for a response. While the resolution is earned, the "cost" is primarily conceptual (living with uncertainty) rather than an acute on-page sacrifice, which keeps the tension just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "interpretation as creation" and "editing history" is woven masterfully through both the plot and the motif of the fountain pen. The story avoids preachy moralizing, instead letting the star's change serve as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, intelligent, and melancholic, perfectly suiting the isolated academic protagonist. The shift from scientific observation to emotional realization is handled with smooth transitions in psychic distance. The voice remains confident even when describing the impossible physics of the anomaly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. Phrases like "thresh meaning from experience" are excellent. The only minor flaw is the repetition of the "confidently uncertain" phrase, which feels slightly mechanical in its re-insertion at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes classic sci-fi tropes (time dilation, first contact guilt) into a fresh, emotionally specific narrative. While the "do-over" mechanic is a familiar genre device, the framing of it as "editing" rather than just time travel adds a distinct and thoughtful layer.</comment>
