<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mirabel’s internal landscape is well-rendered, balancing her past skepticism with present desperation. The transition from isolation to a redefined independence is a strong, earned internal arc, though the rapid resolution of the external conflict slightly softens the "independence" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure is decisive, but the mechanics of the resolution rely on a convenient "wireless" transmission that bypasses the established constraint of the paired shells. The final image of the "empty shell" creates a momentary ambiguity regarding the transmission's success versus the object's state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and vivid, establishing a strong mood appropriate for the story. However, the descriptor "velvet" is repeated three times (garden, petals, flowers), which diminishes its impact and feels like a tick rather than a deliberate motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes are high and personal, anchored in the sisterly bond. The escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric; the lack of active opposition or a concrete price paid beyond time/effort keeps the tension in a lower register.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory as resistance is handled well, and the recontextualization of isolation into independence is a thoughtful turn. The happy ending slightly undercuts the weight of that independence, as she immediately regains the connection she claimed she could live without.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like quality of the sci-fi elements. The POV remains firmly anchored in Mirabel’s perception, effectively filtering the world through her grief and hope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with good sentence variety. There is a tendency toward adjectival stacking ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") and the aforementioned repetition of "velvet" detracts slightly from the otherwise clean execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of memory quarantine and resonance is a competent synthesis of familiar speculative tropes. While not ground-breaking, the specific execution through the garden and the seashell offers a distinct, if sentimental, flavor.</comment>
