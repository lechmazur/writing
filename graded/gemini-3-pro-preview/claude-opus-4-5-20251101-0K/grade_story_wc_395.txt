<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Helena’s motivation is clearly anchored in her backstory ("where do deleted files go?"), driving her agency. However, her transition from employee to fugitive is swift, lacking the internal friction or hesitation that would make the high-stakes choice to steal data feel fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story achieves closure with a Decisive Change (running), but the central turning point—accessing the sealed vault—relies on a convenient lie to security ("smiled brightly") that meets no resistance. This lack of obstacles undermines the plausibility of a high-security conspiracy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting of the "former missile silo" is excellent, merging the physical and digital via sensory details like "mechanical ghosts" and "corrupted timestamps." The environment actively charges the mood and thematically supports the concept of a digital graveyard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are high (missing persons), and knowledge escalates logically. However, the absence of an active antagonist or immediate on-page threat during the vault scene flattens the tension; the pressure remains largely internal/conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of digital persistence ("deleted files never really went anywhere") is resonant and well-supported by imagery. The explicit explanation of the theme ("Nexus... was a surveillance apparatus") is slightly didactic, telling the reader what the subtext had already shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is polished and consistent, utilizing a lyrical register ("algorithmic detritus," "echo of forgotten songs") that suits the protagonist's role. The POV remains stable and controlled throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong imagery ("stars... burning like distant servers"). Occasional phrasing leans toward the melodramatic ("He had been walked away," "warning. Or a blessing"), but the rhythm and flow are effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The core premise (social network as evil surveillance/people storage) is a familiar genre trope. While the missile silo setting adds a fresh textural layer, the underlying plot beats and the "data discovery" trajectory follow a standard convention.</comment>
