<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eris is distinct and competent, and her motivation regarding her daughter is clear. However, the characterization lacks active internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she begins with a fixed purpose and executes it without hesitation, resulting in a static emotional arc rather than a dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative structure is clean and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the terrace's acoustics—lands with emotional weight. The logic of the magic system is consistent, though the "train whistle" timing relies slightly on convenient coincidence (Kairos) rather than forced causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "acoustic architecture" of the prism terrace effectively constrains the action and integrates beautifully with the plot. Specific details like the "thrumming cables" and "corridors of whispered echoes" ground the fantastical elements in sensory reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist or significant external obstacle opposing Eris, and her internal state is resolved from the start. The narrative lacks the escalation of pressure or hard trade-offs typically required for higher-tier engagement; it reads more as a ritual enactment than a conflict-driven scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into comfort is handled with sophistication, avoiding maudlin sentimentality. The final image of the silence "opening like a door" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is consistent and filtered convincingly through Eris's sound-sensitive perspective. The voice is disciplined, though occasionally dips into slight filtering ("Eris felt it") that distances the reader from the immediate sensation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and lyrical, with good rhythm ("Song," "Gift," "Method"). Some imagery borders on purple ("dust made of light," "silence... like a living thing"), but the technical descriptions of the acoustics balance the softer metaphors well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic science (or magic) with the metaphysics of grief is original and compelling. While the "healing artifact" trope is familiar, the specific execution involving sound waves and prism geometry feels fresh.</comment>
