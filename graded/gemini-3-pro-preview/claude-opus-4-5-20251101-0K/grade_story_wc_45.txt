<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor’s internal conflict between clinical skepticism and familial grief is drawn with precision, driving the decision to dig. The pivot from doctor to researcher of the impossible is motivated by the tactile evidence of the tooth and bones. Her agency is paramount; the desecration of the grave is a bold, character-defining choice that earns the shift in worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and structurally sound, moving efficiently from the catalyst (tooth) to the climax (exhumation) without wasted motion. Closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist commits to a new paradigm with clear conceptual cost (abandoning her "carefully ordered life"). Orientation is established immediately and holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The garden is rendered with sensory specificity ("night-blooming jasmine," "honey left too long"), and the "hollow, delicate" bones serve as a visceral, grounding detail for the supernatural element. The setting acts as a crucible for the transformation, providing the physical evidence that shatters the protagonist's previous reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly internalized and escalated through the physical action of digging with bare hands. The tension between the desire for truth and the fear of "madness" resolves into a satisfying, if slightly romanticized, acceptance of the unknown. The pressure is coherent, though the final "silver bells" release softens the "terrible" aspect of the realization too quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of reconciling science with mystery is compelling, but the ending relies heavily on explicit moralizing ("Skepticism learned to kneel before wonder"). This overt thematic summary in the final paragraph replaces scene pressure with an authorial thesis statement, triggering a significant deduction for Thematic Echo/moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The POV is consistent and firmly anchored in Eleanor’s perspective, blending medical expertise with suppressed longing effectively. However, the narrative voice becomes overly grand and abstract in the final beats ("world was far more vast," "turn sorrow into stars"), distancing the reader from the immediate, gritty reality of the exhumation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished ("shrewdly innocent," "puzzles of calcium"), but the climax and resolution suffer from clichés ("voice like silver bells") and purple phrasing ("turn sorrow into stars"). These artifacts slightly undermine the clinical precision established earlier, particularly in the high-stakes closing moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of forensic pathology and faerie folklore ("setting broken beliefs") offers a fresh lens on the changeling trope. While the "child is still alive" hook is standard genre fare, the protagonist's scientific approach to quantifying the magic elevates the premise above a typical fantasy retelling.</comment>
