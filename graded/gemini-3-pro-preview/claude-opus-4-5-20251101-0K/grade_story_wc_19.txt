<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and her internal arc coheres, but the emotional progression relies heavily on summarized realizations ("tasted like possibility") rather than strictly embodied reactions. The distinction between her father's fear and her own adaptation provides a solid character logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean accumulative arc where the gravity inversion effectively forces a stance shift. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, deferring the final collection to choose immediate growth, which feels earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gravity inversion provides excellent physical constraints that shape the imagery and action. While the "xenial trellis" is distinct, some descriptors like "solidified mist" feel slightly unmoored from physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent, driven by the environmental shift of the inversion. The stakes are internal and legible, though the resolution—choosing to wait—lacks a sharp, immediate cost on the page beyond the deferral of the difficult task.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is articulated explicitly ("Mira had learned a different lesson...") rather than emerging solely through subtext. The repeated "silence tasted like [abstract concept]" structure flattens the nuance into assertions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly mythic tone appropriate for the setting. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally slips into explaining the protagonist's psychology.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flow is generally strong, but the repetitive sentence structure for describing silences creates a noticeable artifact. The phrase "stretching contracted" is grammatically awkward and disrupts the rhythm of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of collecting silences in a doll is inventive and pairs well with the vertical setting. While the "bunker survivor" trope is familiar, the specific mechanics of the trellis and silence-harvesting add freshness.</comment>
