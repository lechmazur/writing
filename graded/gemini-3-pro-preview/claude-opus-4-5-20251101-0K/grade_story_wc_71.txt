<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina is a distinct, contemplative presence, but her central epiphany feels intellectually asserted rather than emotionally earned under pressure. The pivotal realization—"understood in that moment that her grandmother had been wrong"—arrives instantly upon opening the door, lacking the resistance or struggle required to make the internal shift feel dramatic rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the Conceptual Repricing at the end (shifting value from the object to the witness) provides valid closure. However, the turning point relies on a sudden, unprompted insight ("The house exhaled... and she understood") rather than a causal chain of events, which softens the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's standout strength; sensory details like "fog-softened edges" and "wood softened with rain" create a tangible, lived-in world. The setting actively participates in the mood, though the "streetlights daydreamed" personification borders on the precious.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes are purely internal and thematic, which fits the quiet tone but limits narrative urgency. The conflict (understanding the nature of the "alive" houses) is resolved somewhat easily by the protagonist's immediate intuition, resulting in low tension despite the engaging premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of "witnessing as sanctification" is poignant but is delivered through explicit exposition ("This was how you sanctify a space...") rather than subtext. Explaining the story's moral lesson mid-scene reduces the interpretive resonance of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and introspective, matching the protagonist's "noticer" persona. While effective, the narration occasionally slips into over-explanation of the character's internal state instead of trusting the imagery to convey it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. However, it suffers from occasional abstract metaphors ("pulse with a shard of hush") and clunky phrasing ("creeping normality noticer") that slightly disrupt the otherwise smooth flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "house-sitter for ghosts" who maintains spiritual presence through the subtle displacement of objects is fresh and compelling. The execution elevates a familiar melancholic tone into something specific and memorable.</comment>
