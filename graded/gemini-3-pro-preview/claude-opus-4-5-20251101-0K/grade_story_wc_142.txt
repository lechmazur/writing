<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira is a capable protagonist with clear motivation, but her primary trait ("orderly intuitive") is established via label rather than dramatized through complex deduction. Her internal conflict regarding "dual allegiance" is stated in exposition ("pressed against her chest") but she picks a side immediately without visible hesitation or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure relies on summary at the most critical juncture; the meeting where factions "hammered out plans" is glossed over in a montage ("talked until dawn"). This robs the story of its central dramatic scene, replacing necessary conflict with retroactive description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral, with the "raft city" physics effectively constraining movement and shaping the culture (e.g., specific foundation chips, noise competition). The environment feels lived-in and specific, grounding the more abstract political elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the escalation is dampened because the primary hurdle (uniting the factions) is resolved through the summary montage rather than on-page struggle. The "resistance" forms too smoothly, lacking the friction or setbacks that would generate genuine narrative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation is resonant, but the story relies on explicit internal monologue to articulate it ("navigate change by bending without breaking") rather than letting the subtext breathe. The ending serves the theme well but feels slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, it occasionally slips into "telling" mode to explain character traits or social dynamics that could have been revealed through dialogue or action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong sensory imagery ("fractured rainbows," "hungry calculation"). Sentence rhythm is controlled, though the density of exposition in the middle section slows the momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "floating carnival" setting offers a fresh coat of paint, but the underlying narrative arc—saving the community center/home via legal reorganization—is a standard trope. The unique setting does heavy lifting for a fairly conventional plot.</comment>
