<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s internal landscape is well-drawn, merging her engineering background with her ancestral duty in a way that motivates the final sacrifice. The "logically emotional" trait acts as a functional pivot for her decision-making, though it relies slightly on exposition ("a trait her mother called...") rather than pure dramatization. The cost of her choice is visceral and character-specific, grounding the mystical elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Causal drive with a strong, definitive closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) where Vera trades existence for release. The pacing is effective, utilizing the sunset as a ticking clock to pressure the climax. While the resolution of the external threat (mercenaries weeping) borders on convenient, the high personal cost to the protagonist anchors the ending successfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, treating the ice as a tactile constraint ("negotiation between her weight and the frozen pontoons") rather than just a backdrop. The setting effectively pressures the protagonist's journey, though a few descriptors lean toward the ornate ("constellation of greed"). The atmosphere successfully blends the industrial with the mythic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and escalate clearly through the time constraint and the approaching Consortium vessel. The conflict resolves through a decisive act of agency with an irreversible cost (Vera's dissolution). The "magical pacification" of the antagonists slightly undercuts the tension, but the focus remains rightly on Vera’s internal and physical struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of release versus preservation is well-integrated into the plot and character action. The final image of the coat and key offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the immediate universal forgiveness ("hardened mercenaries wept") feels slightly didactic, telling the reader how to feel about the absolution rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains close to Vera, filtering the world through her specific lens of "logical emotion." The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic subject matter. There is a slight tendency toward over-explanation of internal states, but the narrative distance is generally well-controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and imagery ("mournful whales," "expanding sphere of pure sound"). The insertion of the prompt phrase "fleshly ethereal" feels slightly forced within the sentence structure. Some scaffold phrases ("Vera understood what she must do") could be trimmed for greater immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a technical profession (lighthouse engineer) with a mystical duty creates a fresh angle on the "guardian" trope. The concept of "sonic absolution" is handled with specific, imaginative detail. While the structure is traditional, the specific execution and the melancholic, transformative ending elevate the material.</comment>
