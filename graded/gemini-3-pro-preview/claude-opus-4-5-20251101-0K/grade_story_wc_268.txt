<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira is a distinct presence, and the contradiction of a "diminutive titan" is visually engaging, but she faces minimal internal or external resistance. Her competence is absolute; she solves the mystery and executes the plan without hesitation or struggle, resulting in a lack of felt difficulty or vulnerability on the page. The motivation is clear, but the absence of a personal trade-off limits emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from discovery to resolution, and the "rune of drift" introduces a functional magic system. Closure lands with a completed task and a paid resource cost (the last ink pellet), satisfying the rubric's requirement. However, the resolution feels slightly procedural—a "clean win" where the antagonist offers no direct pushback, reducing the impact of the final victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, rendered with atmospheric precision and sensory detail like the "iron gall" smell and "constellations shift." The concept of the library existing in the pauses between celestial movements is integrated well into the action, grounding the fantasy elements in a specific, tangible logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The stakes are high for the kingdom but low for the protagonist in the moment; Mira encounters no active opposition within the library. The "shifting stars" provide a timer, but she beats it easily, and the discovery of the "misfiled" record feels convenient rather than earned through conflict. The tension is largely intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of bureaucratic truth dismantling illegitimate power ("graceful collapse") is coherent and resonant, avoiding standard violent tropes. The ending image of the documents waiting to be found successfully anchors this theme, though the lack of struggle makes the thematic argument feel somewhat uncontested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for a titan ("mourning veil," "eternal dance"). The distance is appropriate, though at times it leans into abstraction rather than immediate sensory experience. The perspective remains stable throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and high-density, with strong imagery ("black liquid bloomed like smoke"). There are minor instances of overwriting (e.g., "air itself seem clumsy"), and the phrase "regally unpretentious" reads as a tell rather than a shown trait, but the overall line-level craft is solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inversion of the titan archetype—making her small, careful, and bureaucratic rather than large and destructive—is a fresh conceit. The combination of magical runes and mundane paperwork creates a unique flavor of resolution, though the plot itself follows a relatively straightforward path.</comment>
