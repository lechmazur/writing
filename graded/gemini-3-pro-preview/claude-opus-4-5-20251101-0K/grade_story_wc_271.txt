<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mariam’s interiority is distinct and grounded in specific trauma responses, avoiding generic angst. However, the reliance on clinical definitions ("somatic markers," "freeze response") to explain her state creates a slight diagnostic distance that buffers the raw emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A clean Situational arc that utilizes Earned Stasis effectively; Mariam maintains her equilibrium against a specific trigger. The hawk incident provides a necessary pressure spike, and the return to the seedlings offers a legible, grounded closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Excellent integration of environment; the salt-blasted cliff and the orchids' fragility mirror the protagonist's internal state without heavy-handed symbolism. The setting actively constrains the action (wind, soil texture) and grounds the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hawk creates a clear, sharp spike in pressure that tests Mariam's stability. While the resolution via learned therapy techniques is logical, it feels slightly low-cost compared to a messy, forced trade-off or failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dual nature of the arboretum creates strong subtext, but the story undercuts its own resonance by explicitly stating the theme ("Both truths existed simultaneously," "anchor optimism in realism") rather than trusting the imagery to carry the meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, managing the shifts between present observation and intrusive memory with fluid precision. The tone matches the "quietly talented" persona perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and polished with strong sensory details ("henna still fresh," "gold crescents"). A few phrases lean into literary commonplaces ("patient wound," "categories of before and after"), slightly dimming the otherwise sharp execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A sensitive, well-crafted iteration of the "garden as healing" narrative. While the trajectory is somewhat expected, the specific pairing of the lighthouse/arboretum and the drone strike details adds fresh texture.</comment>
