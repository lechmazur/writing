<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara is a compelling, distinct focalizer with a unique vocation that informs her worldview. The internal landscape of grief is rich, though the shift from her initial goal ("write her own obituary") to the actual action (writing her brother's) feels slightly unbridged, creating a minor motivation gap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative lens, building emotional weight through the ritual of writing. However, the pivot from the opening hook (writing her own obituary) to the climax (writing Matthias's) lacks a causal connective step, reading more like a prompt redirection than a character-driven choice. Closure lands with a clear realization (Resonant Reconfiguration).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "amber darkness" and "dried blood" leaves create a cohesive mood. The tactile use of the carpet thread grounds the abstract grief in physical reality, effectively charging the setting with history and loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are deeply personal and internal, centering on the erosion of meaning. While the emotional pressure is sustained, the conflict remains largely static until the "conjuring," and the resolution relies on an internal epiphany rather than a forced trade-off or high-cost external choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing as a practice is resonant but delivered through explicit summary ("she understood at last that healing was not a destination") rather than subtextual implication. This "sermonizing" in the resolution flattens the complexity established earlier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic. It effectively manages the transition between the physical garden and the imagined presence of the brother, maintaining a stable psychic distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("vividly descriptive," "geography of healing") which act as text artifacts. Additionally, phrases like "vividly descriptive truth" tell rather than show the quality of the writing, and "lonesome splendor" leans into purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of an obituary writer for the living is fresh and engaging. However, the execution relies on a somewhat formulaic integration of required elements (repeating them as labels), which detracts from the organic feel of the narrative.</comment>
