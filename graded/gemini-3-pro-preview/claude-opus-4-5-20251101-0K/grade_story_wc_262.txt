<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vera is a distinct focalizer with a specific, enacted skillset, though her internal journey lacks friction; she achieves her goal without significant resistance or contradictory impulses. The "spatial imagination" attribute informs her perception well, but the emotional arc feels somewhat linear and safe, lacking the raw, embodied struggle of a higher-band characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory details to a resonant Conceptual Repricing (storage vs. planting). The closure is legible and conceptually earned, though the progression is smooth and linear, missing the sharp causal turns or high-stakes tightening that would elevate the structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with excellent specificity ("smelled of nitrate dreams," "cork," "Simplex"), and the setting actively constrains and shapes the resolution. The environment feels lived-in and integral to the magic system, grounding the abstract concept of "unused love" in tangible machinery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily atmospheric and thematic; while the deepening of the vision provides momentum, there is little active opposition or pressure forcing a difficult trade-off. The climax resolves through realization rather than a high-cost decision, leaving the narrative feeling low-voltage despite the emotional content.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of preserving unexpressed love is handled with grace, and the shift to "planting" offers a satisfying nuance. However, the ending leans into sentimental resolution ("nourishing and complete," "embraces"), which slightly flattens the complexity established earlier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately hushed, matching the setting's "accumulated silence." Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though reliance on filter verbs ("Vera realized," "she felt") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is evocative ("seats folded shut like sleeping birds"), but occasionally veers into slightly purple abstraction or expositional telling ("Vera was spatially imaginative in ways that made her valuable"). The rhythm is smooth, but the density of adjectives sometimes slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry with cinema history is fresh and specifically rendered, elevating a standard "ghostly resolution" plot. The concept of the "room where unused love is stored" is imaginative, though the execution follows a relatively safe, healing-focused trajectory.</comment>
