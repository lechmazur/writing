<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira demonstrates clear agency and competence in her technical problem-solving, grounding the abstract premise in action. However, the emotional peak ("wept, though she couldn't have explained why") relies on a diagnostic shortcut rather than embodied experience, and her motivation feels slightly like a declared slogan rather than a lived drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal arc is solid, with the technical pivot (discarding assumptions) directly enabling the resolution and closure. Orientation is immediate and effective, though the star fragment's sudden physical warmth sits awkwardly against the story's established respect for mechanical realism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voxhaven is established with vivid, specific imagery ("gorge yawned," "platforms... on cables") that effectively grounds the surreal premise. The "serenely electric" atmosphere is woven well into the setting, balancing the decay with a sense of charged potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The central conflict is clear and resolved through the protagonist's specific actions, adhering to the "man vs. machine" dynamic. However, the stakes remain intellectual and thematic; the cost of failure is not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the tension moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the theme is coherent, the ending relies on heavy-handed explication ("Endings were not walls but doors") rather than letting the imagery do the work. This tendency to summarize the moral in the final paragraphs deflates the resonance of the actual signal reception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a controlled distance. It occasionally drifts into slightly purple phrasing ("cloak woven from the space between heartbeats"), but generally supports the "fantasy practicality" tone well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and dense, with effective technical verbs grounding the fantasy elements. However, the presence of clichés like "space between heartbeats" and slightly strained personification ("mouth that had forgotten how to close") mars the line-level execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The setting of a radio tower city suspended over a gorge offers a fresh visual wrapper for the familiar "cosmic listener" trope. The synthesis of elements is competent, though the "beginning in every ending" epiphany feels like a standard genre comfort rather than a novel insight.</comment>
