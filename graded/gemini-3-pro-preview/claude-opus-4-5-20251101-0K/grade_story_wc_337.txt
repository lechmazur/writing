<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s internal arc is clear, but the climax relies on summary ("Somewhere in the unraveling, she had found her own knot and worked it free") rather than dramatized experience. The shift from trembling trauma to steady resolution happens off-camera within the text, reducing the earned emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is solid, moving from the physical action of unraveling to the metaphysical release. Closure is distinct (Resonant Reconfiguration), though the internal pivot that drives the final decision is slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is an evocative setting that actively participates in the scene ("prisms angling to catch her answer"). The atmosphere is consistent, though the reliance on "fractured starlight" becomes repetitive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and lacks strong resistance; Callum yields his secret easily, and Mira’s internal obstacle dissolves via summary. The cost is stated ("words cost her more than she expected") but not fully felt in the moment of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of restoration through acknowledging brokenness is coherent. The ending image of stitching gold into breaks (kintsugi) is resonant but borders on a familiar trope, slightly softening the thematic impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone suited to the fable-like quality. The POV remains firmly anchored in Mira’s perception without unmotivated shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery becomes repetitive, creating a scaffold effect: "fractured starlight" appears three times (paras 1, 4, 7), and "interlaced hush" repeats. The climax relies on abstract telling ("lucid unrest," "strange economy") rather than concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of unraveling ghost nets to free spirits is a fresh, specific synthesis. However, the resolution relies on the "gold repair" metaphor, which is a common device in stories about broken objects and healing.</comment>
