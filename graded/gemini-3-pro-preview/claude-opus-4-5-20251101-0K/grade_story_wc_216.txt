<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera is a distinct focalizer with a clear motivation ("understanding" over "more life"), and her specialized senses are well-established. However, her internal landscape lacks friction; she moves through the discovery without contradictory impulses or doubt, making her role feel more like a vessel for the concept than a character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration of her life's purpose) is earned by the scene. However, the pivotal climax relies on a convenient epiphany—Vera intuits complex encoded coordinates instantly ("Vera understood now")—which bypasses the dramatization of the deduction process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "emerald silo" creates a vivid, constraint-based environment where "green waves" make time visible, grounding the metaphysical premise in sensory reality. The tactile details, such as the "sediment layers" of time in the ceramic fragment, effectively bridge the gap between the abstract concept and the physical scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stakes are high thematically but low in immediate dramatic pressure; Vera faces no active opposition, time constraint, or risk of failure in the moment. The escalation is intellectual and linear, lacking a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt or where a difficult trade-off is forced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "Numerical Reformation" is a compelling thematic engine that is well-integrated through the poignant mechanism of the garage sale listings. The story effectively explores the shift from quantitative to emotional value, though the ending leans slightly into explicit moralizing rather than letting the resonance stand on its own.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The contemplative, lyrical voice suits the material and maintains a consistent psychic distance. The delivery of the world-building (the Reformation) is slightly expository and detached in the opening, reading more like a summary than immediate character experience, but the tone recovers during the interaction with the capsule.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished and atmospherically dense ("gossamer-thin," "sediment layers"), supporting the ethereal tone without sacrificing clarity. The imagery is specific and evocative, and the text is free of distracting artifacts or repetitive sentence structures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-numerical society with mundane garage sale listings as emotional time capsules is highly inventive and distinct. The story transforms standard time-travel tropes into a fresh form of emotional archaeology that feels conceptually daring and memorable.</comment>
