<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s shift to weaponizing "curiosity" is a sophisticated character beat that demonstrates her specific intellect and worldview. However, her interiority frequently functions as exposition for the antagonist's nature rather than exploring her own immediate emotional contradiction or doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The countdown creates effective structural pressure, but the resolution relies on a "magic switch" mechanic where the device works instantly without on-page complication. The cost—a subtle disassociation from humanity in the final reflection—is alluded to but lacks visceral weight relative to the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "burnt coffee" and the "subsonic hum in her teeth" effectively ground the cosmic stakes in a gritty reality. The physical constraints of the booth (welded door) actively pressure the protagonist's choices and timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dual pressure of the supernatural signal and the physical mob creates a clear ticking clock. However, the antagonists remain somewhat abstract or walled-off, and the conflict dissolves too cleanly once the protagonist executes her plan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thematic pivot—combating polarization with uncertainty rather than righteousness—is nuanced and intelligent. The execution, however, is didactic, explicitly diagnosing the theme ("That was exactly what the tricksters wanted") rather than letting it emerge solely from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, competent scientific filter that fits the protagonist well. There are occasional slips into melodramatic phrasing ("divided cleanly as a bone snapping") that feel slightly overwritten for the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Momentum is strong, and the visceral description of the signal ("liquid of her eyes") lands well. The score is held back by a few clichés ("Frankenstein creation") and reliance on lists of abstract nouns ("Fear. Certainty.") to convey emotion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the "energy-feeding aliens" trope is familiar, applying it to campus polarization offers a specific, grounded update. The resolution via "curiosity" adds a distinct intellectual flavor to an otherwise standard sci-fi setup.</comment>
