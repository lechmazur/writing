<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marguerite’s interiority is deeply felt and specific, grounding the grief in the tangible actions of carving. The motivation to "contain" her loss is consistent and poignant, though the narrative leans heavily on reflection (approx. 30%) rather than immediate interaction. The emotional progression feels authentic, moving from memory to a stabilized "earned stasis" without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, using the boiling kettle as a precise temporal frame to contain the reflection. Closure is achieved through Resonant Reconfiguration; the realization that "this was enough" feels earned by the sensory work preceding it. The structure is tight and effective for this meditative mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details—the smell of sawdust/musk, the "rain-beaded skylight," the grain of the ash wood—are excellent and constrain the character's focus. The setting actively shapes the mood and mirrors the internal state (the "rust-hued" loft matching the season). The environment feels lived-in and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are purely internal—the management of grief—and while poignant, the external pressure is low (only the kettle). The narrative lacks a sharp moment of tightening or risk; the resolution feels like a gentle settling rather than a stance forged under active pressure. It works for the quiet tone but misses the "meaningful tightening" of higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but over-articulated. The narrative explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("mourning needed a container," "time does not heal, it crystallizes," "This was what she had harvested"). This reduces subtextual power, converting earned insight into direct explanation, particularly in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent melancholic but sturdy tone that fits the protagonist perfectly. Psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Marguerite’s perception. The transition between the memory of Viktor and the present action is handled smoothly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good rhythm ("slow climb toward singing"), though it occasionally leans into "writerly" phrasing ("soft percussion," "painted the city"). The repetition of key motifs ("here and gone," "crystallized") borders on heavy-handed but generally serves the accumulative structure well. No major artifacts or stumbles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a lion tamer’s widow carving props to manage grief is a fresh, specific angle on a common theme. While the "grief is love persevering" conclusion is familiar, the specific vehicle of the ash wood and the lions elevates the execution above standard fare.</comment>
