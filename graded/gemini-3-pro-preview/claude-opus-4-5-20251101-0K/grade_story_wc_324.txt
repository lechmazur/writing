<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera functions efficiently as a narrative device rather than a character with internal friction; her "persistent curiosity" and loneliness are stated in exposition rather than dramatized through difficult choices. The interaction lacks status dynamics or emotional risk for the protagonist, resulting in a competent but flat execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, low-resistance path where the problem (grief) is resolved immediately by the protagonist's arrival and the magical device's perfect function. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" ending with no visible cost or trade-off; everything resolves neatly without complicating the protagonist's stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmospheric details ("evening fog pooled like spilled milk," "bones remembered sickness") effectively establish a melancholic tone. While vivid, the setting functions largely as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the characters' choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conflict is negligible; the ghost appears on command, the technology works perfectly, and the grieving woman accepts the resolution immediately. There is no escalation, obstacle, or moment where the outcome is in doubt, leading to a lack of narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its themes ("This was incidental heroism," "grief flowing into forgiveness") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The ending leans into moralizing ("The dead would call again... when the living finally learned how to listen") which flattens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, though it relies on telling over showing for character motivation ("She was persistently curious"). The perspective remains stable, but the emotional distance prevents a deeper engagement with the stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable, though it occasionally dips into cliché ("spilled milk," "soft as cloth"). The reliance on expository summary to explain the magic system and the protagonist's internal state slows momentum in what is already a low-action piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" using a hearing aid is imaginative, but the execution falls into a standard "unfinished business" ghost story template. The lack of subversion or specific, gnarly complications makes the outcome feel predictable.</comment>
