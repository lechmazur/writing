<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation is sharp and drives the narrative from the first paragraph. The "mad scientist" archetype is executed with competence, though the internal conflict is somewhat muted until the realization of "flawed genesis." The shift from seeking restoration to accepting innovation is a solid character beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear, leading to a climax that effectively alters the story world (the mechanical birds glitching). The closure works well as a Conceptual Repricing—the definition of success shifts from perfection to "flawed" life—though the mechanics of "Resonance Reconstruction" border on a magic wand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct; the "suspended palace" and "stalactite anchors" create a strong atmospheric container. The contrast between the cold glass/mechanical birds and the organic warmth of the egg is used effectively to underpin the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (stagnation vs. life), though the pressure is largely internal and intellectual rather than visceral or time-bound. The conceptual cost—accepting that the past cannot be perfectly restored—is landed well, even if the physical obstacles are minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The central theme of hybridity and "flawed" creation is strong, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Genesis was always flawed") to land the point. This reduces subtextual resonance, explaining the theme rather than trusting the final image to carry it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone is consistent, fitting the "science-fantasy" genre, though occasionally melodramatic ("bitter symphony," "desperate purpose"). The POV remains stable with Aldric, filtering the world clearly through his obsession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from abstract phrasing ("quaking reverie of genuine amazement") and some cliché ("trembling hands," "bitter symphony"). Dialogue tags occasionally summarize thought rather than letting the line stand alone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twist—that the resurrection results in a glitchy, hybrid form of life rather than a pristine return to the past—is a refreshing take on the "bring back the extinct" trope. It adds a layer of complexity to the resolution.</comment>
