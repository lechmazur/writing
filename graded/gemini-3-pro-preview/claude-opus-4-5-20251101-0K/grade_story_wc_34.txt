<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira functions primarily as a vessel for the concept rather than a fully realized character with internal friction; her success feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. While her motivation is clear, she lacks a distinct counter-impulse or moment of doubt to give her agency weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on expository backstory (paragraphs 3-5, 8) to establish the premise, stalling the immediate scene's momentum. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "magic success" resolution lacks a felt cost paid in the present moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is evocative, blending the organic (mist, courtyard) with the digital (pixels, code) effectively. Specific sensory details like the "cold brass" and "shimmering pixels" ground the ethereal concept well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conflict is largely external and static; the ghost asks for help, and Mira provides it without encountering significant resistance or failure. The storm acts as atmospheric set-dressing rather than a pressure mechanism that forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered explicitly through the ghost's literal words (LONELY, AFRAID) and Mira's dialogue ("You want me to sing..."), leaving little room for subtext. The result is didactic, telling the reader the meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it leans toward "purple" descriptors ("liminal moment," "tinkersong wonder"). The tone serves the genre well but occasionally prioritizes aesthetic labeling over immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and legible, with some strong imagery ("fragments of corrupted data"). However, adjectival phrasing ("driftingly alert awareness") and compound descriptors occasionally clutter the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of graffiti culture, coding, and monastic tradition offers a fresh, creative conceptual frame. While the execution feels slightly like a prompt-stitch, the core idea creates a distinct and memorable aesthetic.</comment>
