<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s transition from "reticent skipper" to active guardian is earned through specific interaction with the setting. Her internal shift is motivated by the vacuum of the abandoned lighthouse, and the choice to break her silence carries a felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is excellent; the rebuilding of the cairn with the sea glass functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration that conveys her decision visually. The plot mechanics of the stone language integrate perfectly with the inciting incident of the empty tower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lantern room is rendered with tactile specificity—"rust on the handrails," "dead lens in fractured prisms." The micro-setting of the lamp base and the stone cairn effectively constrains the protagonist's options and shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Internal stakes are legible; the pressure of the "longing" and the break in the chain forces a clear trade-off (anonymity for responsibility). The escalation is quiet but coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is built well through the cairn and letters but is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final lines ("Some vessels... And some lights never truly go out"). This summary explains the metaphor rather than letting the final image resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlling the atmospheric tone well. The third-person limited perspective stays firmly with Maren’s perceptions, blending her practical knowledge with the lyrical mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic but occasionally overwritten ("luminescent weight," "silence that speaks"). These poetic turns sometimes border on cliché, though the density of specific imagery remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story executes a classic sentimental lighthouse trope with competence. While the stone-stacking language adds a fresh layer of specificity, the ghost/presence and the message of "continuity" feel familiar.</comment>
