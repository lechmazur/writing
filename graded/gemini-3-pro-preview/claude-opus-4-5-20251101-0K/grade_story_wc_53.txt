<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and the internal conflict is well-externalized through the ghost. However, the protagonist's pivotal realization relies heavily on "therapy-speak" articulated by a secondary source (the overheard old man) rather than an organic, embodied discovery in the moment. This reduces the emotional agency of the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scene structure is solid, with a clear beginning, middle, and end that lands a Resonant Reconfiguration. The causality of the turning point is slightly weak; the resolution depends on a lucky "overheard fragment" from the past rather than a tactic generated by the immediate pressure of the ghost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "kinetic lagoon" is a vivid, specific environment that actively shapes the narrative and metaphor. The imagery of "phosphorescent spray" and "chemical ghosts" effectively grounds the surreal concept in sensory details that enhance the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The stakes are legible—survival versus the weight of past ambition. The escalation is functional, though the negotiation feels slightly circular until the protagonist deploys the overheard quote. The cost is felt in the final admission ("I can't become you again").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing. The inclusion of the old man's aphorism ("It's the person you stopped being...") and the dialogue ("Ambition... erodes from fear") articulate the thesis too directly, acting as a Thematic Echo that reduces subtextual power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent melancholic and reflective tone that suits the setting. The distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Mira’s internal landscape while managing the external dialogue with the ghost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and atmospheric with high information density ("serrated edge worn smooth," "chemical ghosts"). The rhythm is controlled, though some dialogue leans slightly toward aphorism, which creates a minor feeling of artificiality in the speech patterns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of scavenging memories from a kinetic lagoon above the clouds is imaginative and fresh. While the "negotiating with a past self" trope is familiar, the specific setting and the mechanic of the camera wheel elevate the execution.</comment>
