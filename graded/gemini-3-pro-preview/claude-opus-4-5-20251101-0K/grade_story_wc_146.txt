<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is an archetype of competence without internal dimension. She functions as a force of nature—perfect, patient, and unwavering—which suits the fable mode but fails the rubric’s requirement for internal conflict, contradictory impulses, or difficult micro-choices. She faces no doubts and pays no personal price; her "patience" is a stated trait rather than a dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Structure is elegant and effective under an Accumulative lens, moving rhythmically through the three-day ritual to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure. The twist—that she is burying the town rather than saving it—re-prices the central action meaningfully. The ninety-year coda serves as a necessary validation of the "seed" metaphor, offering legitimate closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is active and distinct, treating the town and mountain as living entities with "corroded tongues" and "bones." Sensory details like the "vibrations too low for human ears" and the "cracks spreading" ground the magical realism in tactile specificity. The environment successfully constrains the pacing and nature of the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stakes are high (survival/destruction), but the narrative lacks active resistance; the tuner’s success is a foregone conclusion, turning the plot into a procedural of euthanasia rather than a dramatic conflict. While the conceptual pressure of the "inevitable collapse" works atmospherically, the protagonist faces no obstacles that force a change in tactics or a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "destruction as planting" is integrated beautifully into the action, subverting the "ghost town" trope with a cyclical philosophy. The final image of the granddaughter completes the logic of the "seed" established in the climax. The story commits fully to its premise that some things must fall to rise again.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic distance appropriate for a fable, with controlled cadence and authority. The shift in time scale is handled smoothly. However, the omniscient perspective occasionally creates a barrier to emotional immediacy, observing the "seventeen souls" from a detached height.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished but occasionally lapses into purple or melodramatic phrasing (e.g., "gleamed like frozen midnight," "tears tasted like relief"). These artifacts distract slightly from the otherwise solid density and momentum. The line-level craft supports the solemn tone but misses the highest tier of freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of "tuning" a town’s destruction to ensure a gentle collapse is a genuinely fresh and imaginative inversion of the savior archetype. The synthesis of sound-magic with the lifecycle of a town feels specific and earned. The risk of the long time-jump pays off the central metaphor.</comment>
