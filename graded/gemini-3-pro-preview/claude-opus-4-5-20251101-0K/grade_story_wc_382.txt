<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator is distinct but passive, accepting the supernatural premise and the successor role without dramatized internal conflict or a high-stakes choice that tests their resolve. The transition from neighbor to apprentice happens largely through summary rather than scene-based struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mosaic structure effectively spans the timeline, and the cyclical closure (Conceptural Repricing of the sugar) lands with resonance. However, the pivotal climax of Voss's departure is narrated in summary rather than shown as a dramatized beat, reducing its impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and active; the building's sentience is established through specific, sensory constraints ("morning stretches," "lullabies") that actively shape the narrator's learning process and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Escalation is textural rather than causal; the narrative lacks a decisive tightening or obstacle that forces the narrator to earn the succession through visible risk or sacrifice. The progression feels inevitable rather than fought for.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of lineage and "agreed upon lies" is tightly woven, elevating the simple plot; the ending recontextualizes the sugar motif beautifully to answer the central thematic question about how dead languages survive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The retrospective voice is consistent, atmospheric, and assured, effectively managing the time compression. It maintains a specific "fable" tone that justifies the summary, though it keeps the emotional stakes somewhat distant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic with high information density, successfully establishing the magical realism. It occasionally leans on standard similes ("like a secret language," "like a memoir"), but the "building as text" imagery is sustained well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inversion of the haunted house trope into a pedagogical relationship is fresh, and the specific "grammar" of the building adds a distinct layer of ingenuity to the mentor-student dynamic.</comment>
