<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Yara is a deeply realized focalizer with a specific, embodied response to trauma. The shift from the diagnostic "survivor's guilt" to the visceral sensation of "incompleteness" creates authentic interiority. The emotional cost of her obsession is palpable, though the mention of the therapist feels slightly expository compared to the strength of the immediate sensory details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story follows a strong Accumulative drive, gathering weight through memory and calculation to land a Conceptual Repricing at the closure. The ending successfully reconfigures the geode from "smoke" to "unbearably real," anchoring the protagonist's abstract hunt in a heavy, physical cost. The narrative arc is tight and the orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity is exceptional; images like clouds resembling "brain tissue" and breath fogging the viewport effectively mirror Yara's internal isolation. The setting acts as a crucible for the character's obsession, physically separating her from the earth she mourns while grounding the sci-fi elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly established as existential and emotional. While the external pressure is low (waiting for breakers), the internal pressure of the "hunt" drives the narrative effectively. The "spike" on the readout serves as a meaningful deepening of the pattern, validating her persistence even if it doesn't dramatically alter her physical circumstances.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The exploration of "unused potential" versus "wasted hope" is nuanced and resonant. The story avoids simple platitudes about grief, instead offering a complex view of survival as a search for lost futures. The final image integrates the theme perfectly without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic precision that blends scientific terminology with poetic observation. The shift between perturbation equations and traumatic memory is handled with excellent control, maintaining a stable psychic distance throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high density and strong rhythm. The required phrase "intangibly tangible" is oxymoronic but woven effectively into the reflection on memory. Transitions between the technical and the lyrical are smooth, and the imagery is concrete and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of using quantum perturbation to map "unrealized futures" as a coping mechanism for trauma is a fresh, intelligent synthesis. It transforms the standard post-apocalyptic survivor trope into something specific and metaphysically engaging.</comment>
