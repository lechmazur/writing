<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus is a functional protagonist, but the "gossip-column" persona is stated in exposition rather than demonstrated through behavior or voice in the scene. The dialogue leans heavily on expository declaration of traits ("You always advises...") rather than organic interaction. Motivation is clear, but the emotional connection feels efficient rather than lived-in.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is complete with a clear inciting incident and closure. However, the climax is mechanically convenient—turning on a generator resolves the conflict without a tactical shift or deepening of the crisis. The logic of the orchard as an anchor is slightly fuzzy but serves as a functional ticking clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The archive setting is rendered with evocative sensory details ("smelled of dust," "fluorescent lights flickered"). The contrast between the dusty interior and the doomed orchard outside effectively grounds the supernatural elements. The setting actively pressures the timeline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the ticking clock provides urgency, the central conflict lacks active resistance; the demon is extracted passively once the machine is activated. There is no moment where the plan fails or requires a painful adaptation, resulting in a low-stakes climax despite the stated risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed explication in dialogue and narration ("Imperfect miracles are all I've ever managed"). The ending summarizes the moral lesson ("space between failure and redemption") rather than trusting the imagery to convey the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally slips into melodrama ("eyes, dark pools of unfinished business"). The tone balances the sacred and scientific reasonably well, though the dialogue tags and interiority sometimes feel overly constructed to serve the premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A significant subject-verb agreement error in pivotal dialogue ("You always advises") disrupts immersion. The prose suffers from abstract, purple metaphors ("pools of unfinished business") that reduce clarity and emotional impact. Mechanical competence is otherwise acceptable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "techno-exorcist" and "haunted artist" tropes are familiar genre staples executed competently but without a fresh subversive angle. The specific combination of elements feels organic, but the resolution relies on standard urban fantasy mechanics.</comment>
