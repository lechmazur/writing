<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Miriam is competent and distinct, but she lacks internal friction or genuine struggle. The line "Miriam understood. She always understood" flattens the dramatic tension, positioning her as a passive recipient of the ghost's request rather than an active agent navigating risk or doubt. Her compliance is immediate, leaving her character arc static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative is coherent and the orientation is solid, but the structure is strictly linear with no obstacles. The story functions as a simple transaction: ghost appears, requests help, protagonist agrees. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (shifting from repair to remembrance), but the lack of causal complications makes the journey feel inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "sick yellow light" and specific dust accumulation patterns ground the scene effectively. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active element that Miriam reads like a text. The sensory details regarding the ticket office create a tangible, lived-in decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Pressure is virtually non-existent. The ghost is "sad but not frightening," and the retrieval of the object requires no effort or overcoming of resistance. Without an antagonist, a difficult trade-off, or a constraint on Miriam's ability to help, the stakes remain abstract and the resolution feels automatic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Cracks in the facade. Always cracks.") rather than subtextual action. The story tells the reader what it means instead of allowing the meaning to emerge from a hard choice. The connection between the elevator strata and history is clever but stated too overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriate for the melancholic tone. The POV remains firmly with Miriam, filtering details through her technician's eye. Transitions are smooth, though the emotional range is somewhat narrow due to the lack of conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and readable with good rhythm. However, there is a reliance on telling over showing in key emotional beats ("She'd learned long ago that the boundary... was thinner"). Some phrasing leans toward cliché ("voice like wind through paper"), but technical descriptions are sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "benevolent ghost seeking vindication for a lost relative" is a very common trope, and this iteration plays it straight without subversion. While the elevator technician angle offers a fresh entry point, it is utilized primarily for access rather than complicating the plot or offering a unique solution.</comment>
