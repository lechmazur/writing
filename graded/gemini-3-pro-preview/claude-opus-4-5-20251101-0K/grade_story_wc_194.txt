<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The protagonist functions as a passive receptacle for backstory rather than an active agent; emotions are summarized ("felt tears") rather than embodied in choice or struggle. There is no internal conflict; she suspects the truth, receives it, and accepts it without resistance or cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative structure is coherent, but the central turning point relies on a magical exposition dump ("The silence spoke first") rather than causal action. Closure is a functional Resonant Reconfiguration (crank becomes key), though the cost is low.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and central to the premise, effectively utilizing the "sepia" and "amber" palette to unify the scene. The gramophone mechanism is a specific, well-integrated tool that grounds the abstract "standing waves" concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stakes are low in the present moment as the protagonist faces no active opposition or internal doubt. The escalation is informational rather than dramatic; the revelation is delivered smoothly to a character ready to receive it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit summary ("destroyed out of love," "bridge of intuition") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The result feels slightly moralizing and didactic rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies heavily on filter verbs ("suspected," "understood," "sensed") that distance the reader. The tone fits the literary aim but occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished but overwrought, relying on clichés ("pooled like honey," "yawn of evening") and dense adjectival stacking. The repetition of "understood/understanding" in the climax dulls the precision of the insight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "shadow-gramophone" is a creative central image, but the underlying plot of "blood money legacy revealed in an attic" is a standard trope. The execution follows a familiar linear path without subverting expectations.</comment>
