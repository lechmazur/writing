<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s internal landscape is lyrical and consistent, but the emotional peak relies on labeled feeling (“screaming tenderness”) rather than embodied struggle or contradictory impulse. The boy functions largely as a recipient of her wisdom rather than an agent of equal pressure, which softens the central relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands clearly, but the progression is low-friction; the boy’s acceptance of his new role feels immediate and inevitable. The lack of a moment of doubt or visible cost before the resolution softens the narrative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "bruise" of the lighthouse and the misplaced garden scent ground the magical realism in visceral, specific detail. The sensory environment effectively mirrors the internal shift from exhaustion to renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the boy arrives seeking help and accepts it without complication, missing an opportunity for escalation or resistance. The stakes remain thematic rather than urgent, resulting in a smooth but tension-light resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("She knew... that whispers travel farther") rather than emerging solely from subtext. The resonance is earned, but the direct statement of the moral slightly flattens the ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident and consistently elevated, suiting the magical realist mode. While occasionally bordering on precious ("fingers like dried flowers"), the control of rhythm and tone effectively maintains the dreamlike quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery ("paint the exact color of exhaustion"), maintaining strong momentum. Line-level craft is high, avoiding scaffold and loops, though the phrase "screaming tenderness" leans heavily into melodrama.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a lighthouse for lost intentions is evocative, if slightly familiar territory in the genre. The synthesis of the garden scent with the maritime setting offers a fresh, specific sensory anchor that elevates the concept.</comment>
