<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira functions as a competent vehicle for the plot but lacks internal friction; the moral dilemma of destroying a living man's reputation for a dead man's crime is acknowledged conceptually but not felt. Her interiority largely explains the magic system rather than dramatizing the personal cost of the "knife" decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative structure is clean with a legible orientation and closure, but the pivotal discovery relies on a convenient psychic vision ("margins of Marcus's dream") rather than active investigation. The resolution feels inevitable, lacking the drag of genuine causal resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are vivid, tactile anchors that successfully integrate atmosphere with the story's mechanics. The specific imagery of the "warped glass" and "amber and shadow" grounds the supernatural elements in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conflict is low-voltage as the antagonist is deceased and off-page, leaving Mira with no immediate opposition. The stakes are theoretical (village peace/reputation) rather than visceral, and the climax arrives without a forcing move that tests the protagonist's commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motifs of frozen memory and the "drowned foundations" cohere well, offering a resonant conceptual repricing at the end. The distinction between justice and absolution is raised intelligently, though the resolution simplifies this complexity into a standard exposure of truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the gothic tone with controlled narrative distance. However, it occasionally slips into expository summary ("Mira was what the coastal villages called...") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished but occasionally overwrought with adjective-heavy description ("amber and shadow," "sacred cold"). While the imagery is often effective, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum without adding necessary pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "ghost whisperer" trope is handled competently but breaks little new ground; the specific mechanics of dream cameos and the snow globe add texture but the plot trajectory remains predictable. The synthesis of elements is smooth but safe.</comment>
