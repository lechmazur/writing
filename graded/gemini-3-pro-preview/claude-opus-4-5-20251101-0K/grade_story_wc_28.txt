<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kira functions effectively as a vehicle for the plot, but her interiority relies on stated labels ("gentle radical") rather than contradictory impulses in the moment. While her empathy is established, she lacks the internal friction or specific, non-functional flaws that would deepen the characterization beyond her role as a historian-hero.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, moving from a general sensory memory (tessera) to a specific historical recovery (stepping stone). Closure is distinct and acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the space, though the transition between discovering the stone and knowing exactly where to look feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric, utilizing the "fractured dome" and "shattered sky" to good effect. The stepping stone serves as an effective micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's focus and enables the climax, grounding the magical elements in a tangible object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates appropriately under the textural/accumulative lens, deepening from the artisan’s hope to the soldier’s tragedy. While the external stakes are low (no immediate threat), the emotional weight of the task provides sufficient momentum for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered explicitly through "told" phrases like "stubborn human need to remember tenderness." The moral universe is somewhat binary and tidy, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that characterizes higher-band thematic work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the elegiac tone. However, the register occasionally slips into clunky exposition ("retrocognitively trapped") or slightly melodramatic phrasing ("thundered through her consciousness") that distances the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally competent but suffers from forced phrasing to accommodate prompt elements ("warm coldness," "arms of steel"). The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" is a dense, rhythmic stumble, and "world dissolved" is a familiar cliché that flattens the magic's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of a psychometric historian restoring names in a post-apocalyptic ruin is a familiar trope executed competently here. While the specific synthesis is functional, it doesn't offer a radically fresh perspective or subversion of the genre standard.</comment>
