<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is distinct, and her decision to stay and build establishes strong agency and endurance. The shift from passive interpretation to active construction is well-motivated by the calls, though the "geography of loss" motivation relies slightly on abstract labeling rather than purely embodied desire.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a coherent Situational lens, escalating from the inciting failure to the completion of the array. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis, with the protagonist accepting her role in a time-loop logic that feels earned within the story's rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and tactile, with details like the green-black patina and buried cables grounding the magical elements. The station functions effectively as both a physical shelter and a spiritual instrument, constraining choices and shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, pitting the protagonist against entropy and grief with visible physical labor ("hands raw"). While the external pressure of rising waters remains somewhat background, the internal pressure to complete the beacon effectively drives the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief is resonant, but the text explicitly summarizes its thesis ("It was about creating a path for loss itself...") near the end. This explicit telling reduces the subtextual power of the final image and flattens the ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the magical realist tone. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally leans into elevated abstractions ("indifferent and eternal") that slightly distance the immediate physical experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good rhythm, though the repetition of "geography of [loss/grief]" acts as a minor conceptual loop. Information density is high, but the use of abstract noun phrases occasionally blunts the impact of the concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse for souls is a familiar trope, as is the time-loop communication with oneself. However, the specific integration of the "reverse migration" and the manual manipulation of starlight offers a fresh, cohesive synthesis.</comment>
