<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Yara's internal conflict between empirical training and heritage is compelling, grounding the magical elements in professional identity. The surrender of agency at the climax ("didn't remember planting it") fits the mystical logic but slightly softens the character's final decisive moment on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, with a clear inciting incident and ticking clock (monsoon) providing coherent structure. The resolution relies on a fugue-state action (planting while unconscious), which works for the tone but bypasses a conscious, agentic choice at the critical beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "empirically whimsical" ridge is excellent, functioning as both atmosphere and a necessary plot enabler that supports botanical contradictions. The setting actively participates in the resolution, justifying the high score by constraining and guiding the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined (memory vs. oblivion) and escalated by the approaching storm. The pressure is coherent, though the external threat of the monsoon "washing away everything" feels slightly hyperbolic compared to the precise, nuanced internal struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory as "care" versus "fact" is resonant and well-developed through the protagonist's profession. However, the dream sequence explicitly articulates the thesis ("Collective memory wasn't facts..."), which reduces the subtextual power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone that suits the magical realism elements. The shift from clinical observation to mystical acceptance is handled with smooth transitions and appropriate tonal modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery ("doubt glowed... like phosphorescence"). The dream sequence relies heavily on filter verbs ("She saw... She saw..."), which distances the reader slightly during the most visceral moment of connection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "reality checker" in a magical setting offers a fresh lens on the science-vs-myth trope. While the "magical seed" element is standard, the specific execution through the protagonist's professional struggle adds necessary ingenuity.</comment>
