<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Helena’s backstory as a copyist provides a strong, specific grounding for her current method of resistance, elevating her beyond a generic rebel. However, her reaction to the patrol relies on a standard "fox" false-alarm beat that misses an opportunity to show unique character stress responses. The transition from internal doubt to resolve is summarized rather than dramatized in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The situational drive is clear, and the broadcast ritual provides a solid structural spine. The closure works as Earned Stasis, with Helena persisting despite the threat. The cutaways to "basements and barns" distract slightly from the immediate scene tension, diffusing the focus just as the patrol threat should be escalating.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "ember alcove" and the modified radio dial create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere that suits the premise. However, the description relies on some worn clichés ("mist heavy as velvet") that dull the sensory impact. The specific mechanics of the "secretly luminous" dial offer a nice grounding detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stakes of survival and cultural preservation are clear, but the escalation is mechanical. The "noise outside" turning out to be a fox is a low-stakes false flag that relieves tension cheaply rather than complicating the protagonist's choices. The patrol threat sweeps by without forcing a significant tactical shift on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of memory as resistance is coherent but heavily over-articulated in dialogue ("Dust remembers") and narration. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("memory... was the one fire"), violating the prohibition against sermonizing endings and reducing the thematic resonance to a thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated tone that fits the storyteller persona. The shift in focus to the villagers ("blacksmith," "children") creates a slight head-hopping effect that dilutes the primary POV's immediacy, though it serves the concept of connection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally competent and rhythmic, with strong lines like "architecture of music." However, it suffers from occasional purple phrasing ("thistled calm") and telling ("seemingly harmless") that distances the reader. The metaphor of dust is overworked, appearing in nearly every section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of hiding stories in code is engaging, particularly the use of musical notation as a cipher. However, the broader setup—a lonely broadcaster in a story-banning dystopia—is a familiar trope (reminiscent of *Fahrenheit 451* or *The Giver*) that plays out in a standard fashion without subverting genre expectations.</comment>
