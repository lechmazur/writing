<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mei Lin is a compelling protagonist whose transition from sleeper agent to fortune writer feels earned and distinct. Her motivation to "transpose life into a new key" is beautifully articulated and drives her final choice to unburden herself of the past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, using the journalist's impending arrival as effective pressure to force a resolution. The closure (boxing the specs) is a clear Decisive Change, though the middle section relies heavily on reflective summary rather than active scene work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is atmospheric and integral, with the lighthouse beam and fog mirroring the themes of revelation and obscurity. The microdot specs function well as a micro-setting/prop that anchors the character's history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The internal conflict between hoarding secrets and releasing them is resolved with a tangible cost—giving up the last artifact of her old life. The stakes feel personal and significant, though the external pressure remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ending resonates well, but the mid-story exposition explaining the theme ("This was how open secrets worked... because people preferred mystery") is didactic. This explicit stating of the thesis reduces the subtextual power of the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is precise, authoritative, and consistent, perfectly matching the "pattern recognition" mindset of the protagonist. The distance is controlled effectively, moving from detached observation to intimate reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically assured, particularly in the "All outdated. All useless." sequence. There are no significant artifacts, though the density of "telling" in the reflective passages slows the momentum slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cold war espionage with the whimsical fatalism of fortune cookies is highly original. The concept transforms a standard lighthouse trope into a fresh, specific study of identity and truth.</comment>
