<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren is a consistent focalizer, but her internal life is conveyed through labeled emotions ("sense memory," "kindly methodical") rather than embodied struggle. The lack of contradictory impulses makes her arc feel linear and inevitable rather than earned through difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative moves clearly from trigger to action, but the causality is soft; the decision to leave the letter hinges on a convenient sighting of a crying child rather than escalating pressure. The "why now" feels poetic rather than strictly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library's anatomy (pipe chases, hidden spaces) is well-rendered and grounds the action. However, descriptors occasionally drift into the decorative ("sapphire hush," "spilled ink") rather than doing specific work for the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal and stakes are low; Maren faces no external threat or difficult trade-off. The "cost" of leaving the letter is framed as a benevolent gift devoid of risk, resulting in a cozy resolution without palpable tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its thesis in the final paragraphs ("visibility was not about being seen," "no one was truly invisible who chose to be remembered"). This sermonizing approach flattens subtext into a moral lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is cohesive but overly precious, leaning on "writerly" phrasing ("groaned its acknowledgment," "skeleton"). The tone remains static, lacking the modulation that accompanies rising pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose relies heavily on clichés ("held its breath," "stopped her heart," "spilled ink") and telling ("understood that this was her purpose"). Adverb-adjective clusters and abstract nouns dilute the immediacy of the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "benevolent ghost in the library" trope is familiar and executed here with sentimental earnestness rather than a fresh angle. The lack of grit or subversion leaves the premise feeling safe.</comment>
