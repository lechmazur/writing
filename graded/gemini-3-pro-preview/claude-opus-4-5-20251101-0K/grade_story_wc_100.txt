<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ezra is a sympathetic anchor with a consistent internal state of weariness. His motivation ("inadvertently stubborn") drives the inciting choice effectively, though it is stated rather than dramatized before the event. The emotional arc toward "earned" exhaustion is coherent and touching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear, moving from disruption to ritual to resonant closure. The middle section relies on summary ("For seven nights") rather than dramatized scenes of burial, which softens the causal texture, but the dream-logic transition and resolution land with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the mortuary, the lighthouse lens, and the underwater library is evocative and specific. Images like "books had become reefs" and "bioluminescent fish" create a distinct, immersive atmosphere that grounds the magical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes are clear (rest for the dead), but the obstacle is overcome through a summary montage of labor rather than acute, scene-level resistance. The accumulator lens works, but the lack of a specific, difficult "turn" during the burial process lowers the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of proper witness and burying the past is woven beautifully into the plot mechanics. The ending ("some things must be buried before they can be kept") offers a resonant conceptual repricing that feels earned by the preceding ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic for the subject matter. It maintains a fable-like distance that suits the magical realism elements without becoming detached.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and high-density, with strong sensory detailing. Occasional metaphors lean toward the abstract ("geometry bent like grief"), but the rhythm and imagery generally support the tone well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—an undertaker repairing a lighthouse lens to bury drowned souls in a library—is inventive and fresh. The execution transforms familiar tropes (the weary psychopomp) into something specific and memorable.</comment>
