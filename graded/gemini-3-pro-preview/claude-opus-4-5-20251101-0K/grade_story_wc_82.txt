<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief is stated through summary ("unbearable weight," "heart begged") rather than embodied in contradictory actions or resistance. The psychological shift at the end feels like a convenient authorial pivot rather than an earned evolution of character, lacking the internal friction required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on a "magic fix" that negates the loss without a visible cost; the text claims "luminous torment," but the outcome (peaceful sleep) contradicts this, creating incoherent causality. The resolution feels unearned because the protagonist succeeds completely without facing a difficult trade-off or consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The setting is well-integrated, with the specific properties of the tea garden and basilica driving the plot mechanics. While evocative, the description occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing ("whispered secrets") rather than remaining strictly grounded in sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the midnight deadline provides initial pressure, the climax lacks a genuine test of the protagonist's values; she achieves her goal without sacrifice. The absence of a "felt or conceptual cost" (a required element for high-band conflict) renders the victory hollow and lowers the narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("nothing truly disappears, it only changes form"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for theme. This explanatory conclusion flattens the subtext and prevents the reader from engaging with the complexity of the loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, though it occasionally dips into melodrama. The psychic distance remains stable, but the tone feels somewhat generic to the fantasy genre, lacking a distinct, idiosyncratic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished but marred by sentimental clichés ("grief cracked open like an egg," "mother-love") and filter verbs ("Mei could see"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate experience and reduce the line-level impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of capturing a spirit through optical engineering in a floating tea garden is inventive and visually distinct. However, the execution follows a standard "grief-to-peace" trajectory without subverting tropes or offering a fresh emotional angle on the premise.</comment>
