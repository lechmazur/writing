<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The guardian's silent vigil is established with dignity, and her motivation is clear. However, the boy functions primarily as a prop for her redemption rather than a fully realized agent; his internal state is assumed rather than dramatized through distinct behavior beyond generic "hunching."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and the closure (the boy stepping back) is earned by the interaction. However, the mechanism of resolution—the boathouse shutters projecting complex geometric "constellations" and "nautiluses" onto water—strains physical causality and verisimilitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "cobalt dock" and "bruise healing" are evocative. The score is limited by the boathouse shutters functioning as a high-precision light projector; this mechanical impossibility distracts from the realist setting and feels like a convenient contrivance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are high (life/death), and the tension is palpable. The escalation is somewhat soft; the conflict resolves relatively easily via the light display without a moment of acute doubt or resistance from the boy that forces a harder trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of silent witnessing is resonant, but the story relies on explicit moralizing to land it. The paragraph beginning "See, the light said. Darkness is not absence..." is a didactic intrusion that explains the subtext rather than letting the image speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a reverent, melancholic tone. It occasionally slips into "writerly" over-description ("presence as fixed as iron mooring posts") that distances the reader from the character's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished but marred by the repetition of the awkward prompt phrase "spiralingly calm" (used twice). This specific repetition acts as a text artifact that breaks immersion and lowers the score significantly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "silent watcher saving a jumper" is a familiar trope. While the dental mirror is a novel prop, the "light show" solution feels spatially implausible, and the emotional arc follows a standard template without a distinct, fresh subversion.</comment>
