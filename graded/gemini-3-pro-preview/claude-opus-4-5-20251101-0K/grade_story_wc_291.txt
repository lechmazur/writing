<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clara’s prosopagnosia acts as a rigorous narrative lens rather than a gimmick, driving her unique methodology and fueling the thematic pivot from identification to empathy. The choice to humanize the perpetrator is earned through her specific way of seeing, creating a complex internal landscape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The investigation follows a tight causal chain, leading to a satisfying Conceptual Repricing where "justice" is reconfigured as "witness." The deductive leap regarding the unified face is swift but plausible within the established logic of Clara's perception.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quarry is an active participant, its "granite walls" and "flooded pit" mirroring the silence of the cold case. The atmospheric details constrain the mood effectively, and the setting anchors the final realization about what lies beneath the surface.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate internally from an artistic exercise to a burden of moral knowledge. The cost is felt in the resignation that legal justice is impossible, replaced by the weight of solitary remembrance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of truth as "architecture" versus the fluidity of memory is integrated beautifully. The story avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a resonant meditation on the value of seeing a person clearly, even without the possibility of punishment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistently precise and surgical ("constellation of eyes," "geometry of bone"), perfectly aligning with Clara’s cognitive processing. The distance is maintained masterfully, creating an intimacy born of detachment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong imagery ("rising like tombstones"). The repetition of "furrowed hush" functions well as a structural bookend, reinforcing the quarry's timeless silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a specific neurological condition with forensic reconstruction offers a fresh, intellectual angle on the cold case genre. The execution elevates a familiar "empathy for the villain" trope into something clinically poignant.</comment>
