<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mira functions as a passive vessel for decoding rather than an agent making difficult choices under pressure. Her primary trait ("lucid dream chronicler") is treated as backstory and exposition ("This was her gift") rather than a skill that actively shapes the waking solution mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The narrative lacks causal friction; the central puzzle is solved via summary ("The correspondence was undeniable") rather than dramatized struggle. The climax arrives without a setback or cost, making the resolution feel inevitable and unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory atmosphere is established with competent sensory details ("cold embrace," "humming"), though the spatial connection between the star charts and temple photos remains abstract. The setting supports the mood but doesn't actively constrain Mira's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain theoretical with no immediate on-page threat or time pressure to force a trade-off. Mira faces no external resistance or internal temptation to abandon the task, resulting in a flat trajectory where success is granted rather than won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The message was about shared burdens") rather than subtext or action. The ending explains the meaning of the story to the reader, collapsing ambiguity into a tidy sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but leans toward melodramatic filtering ("echoed through Mira's bones") and breathless exposition. Narrative distance collapses in the final third to accommodate the didactic summary of the theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Functional prose is marred by clichés ("gray fingers of morning," "echoed through bones") and heavy-handed metaphor. The writing often tells rather than shows, particularly during the pivotal translation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "ancient architecture maps to stars" trope is familiar and executed here without a fresh subversive angle. The resolution relies on a standard sentiment about sharing burdens that feels generic rather than specific to these characters.</comment>
