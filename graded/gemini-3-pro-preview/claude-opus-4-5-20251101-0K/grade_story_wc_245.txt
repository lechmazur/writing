<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Meridia’s interiority is excellently grounded in her specific sensory limitations; she perceives the world strictly through touch and vibration, never slipping into visual metaphors. The emotional renunciation at the end is earned by her specific history and professional discipline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is precise, moving from a professional commission to an existential crisis with a clean causal chain. The closure is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the protagonist achieves the goal (the stillpoint) and actively rejects it, reweighting her values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "ultrasonic forest" is a triumph of sensory specificity, translating landscape into vibration and texture without relying on visuals. The environment actively constrains her movement and informs the dowsing process, integrating setting deeply into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate effectively from the difficulty of the mapmaking to the terrifying reality of the destination. The cost—the "terrifying moment" of absolute emptiness—is visceral, forcing a clear choice between pain and numbness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central thematic conflict is poignant, but the final paragraphs drift into explicit moralizing ("The stillpoint taught her that...") rather than letting the renunciation speak for itself. This explains the theme instead of trusting the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically consistent and confident, maintaining a tight psychic distance that filters all description through the mapmaker's tactile worldview. The rhythm matches the "musical" nature of the magic system well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished but occasionally leans on "purple" abstractions ("architecture of grief," "topology of longing") that feel like literary stock phrases. These dilute the otherwise concrete, tactile immediacy of the forest scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of sensory substitution, cartography, and emotional metaphor. The concept of the "stillpoint" as a terrifying void rather than a paradise is a fresh, non-obvious inversion of the trope.</comment>
