<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mei functions primarily as a ritual vessel rather than a complex character; her motivation is clear, but her internal landscape lacks contradiction or resistance. The "latent sacrifice" is accepted without an on-page struggle, making the ultimate cost feel inevitable rather than earned through a difficult decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the ritualistic structure leads to a legible Decisive Change closure. The causality of the puzzle-frame magic is inventive and established well, though the resolution feels slightly too neat in its execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the bamboo forest and orchard providing strong sensory grounding ("green spears," "rotting branches"). The environment actively participates in the ritual, constraining the light and enabling the "raveling silence" mechanic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the ultimate cost is high (dissolution of self), the tension is dampened because Mei faces no active opposition or internal doubt. The escalation is procedural—assembling the frame—rather than a rising pressure that tests her resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("A message can cross any distance...") rather than subtextual emergence. The ending articulates the meaning for the reader, reducing the potential for resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. However, it occasionally lapses into purple prose, and the emotional distance keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Mei's final moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mechanics are clean, but the prose suffers from metaphor density and some clichéd phrasing ("diamonds of light," "tapestry of time"). The forced insertion of the attribute "stoically sparkling" disrupts the rhythm and logic of the description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of puzzle edges forming a magical doorway/frame is an inventive twist on the "message across time" trope. However, the emotional arc follows a standard sentimental path, limiting the story's overall impact.</comment>
