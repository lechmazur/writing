<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's agency drives the resolution through a tangible sacrifice (the river stone). While her motivation is clear, the interiority relies on abstract labels like "luminous regret" rather than embodied contradiction or hesitation, slightly flattening the emotional cost of the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, moving from observation to investigation (comparison) to resolution. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a validated cost (the loss of the heirloom), though the "comparison screen" functions as a convenient expository device to deliver the pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral; the specific constraint of a cloud-bound library with no rivers gives the stone its high value and justifies the shadow's grief. The imagery of "translucent walls" and "light-lattices" successfully establishes the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving hope) is clear, and the resolution requires a permanent loss (the stone). However, the pressure remains low throughout; the shadow is revealed to be non-malevolent early, and Vera faces little obstruction or doubt in executing her plan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief into guardianship is coherent and resonant. However, the subtext is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("grief, properly witnessed, could metamorphose..."), which tells the reader the meaning rather than letting the action speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, lyrical quality that suits the setting. There is a tendency toward repetitive adjectival phrasing ("luminous" appears three times, including the prompt phrase), but the tone remains stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, but prompt insertions create visible seams; "softly deliberate" and "luminous regret" are both repeated verbatim, creating a distinct template/artifact feel. The repetition of "notice/noticer/noticing" (7 times) borders on excessive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "dream library" trope with the specific concept of the library's own grief (the shadow) is a fresh, earned twist. The use of the river stone as a grounding artifact provides a satisfying, specific solution to the abstract problem.</comment>
