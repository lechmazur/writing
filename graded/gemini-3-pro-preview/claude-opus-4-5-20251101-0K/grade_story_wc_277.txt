<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Margaret’s internal pivot from resentment to understanding is efficient and well-motivated by the props (the notebooks). The shift in her perception of her father feels earned, though the "devotedly observant" trait relies slightly more on authorial assertion than dramatized nuance in the opening beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is sturdy, and the closure—a decision to curate the truth—lands with clear conceptual cost. However, the coincidence of the asteroid arriving "tomorrow" after forty years is a heavy narrative convenience that strains credibility for a literary tone, acting as a forced accelerant rather than an organic complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting is atmospheric and functional, mirroring the protagonist’s detached perspective ("cities like circuits"). The sensory details of the tarnished dome and burgundy ink effectively ground the abstract intellectual conflict in physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (global panic vs. ignorant peace) is clear and escalates appropriately with the discovery of the date. The pressure forces a defining choice, though the "journalist calling" acts more as a framing device than an active, on-page antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of benevolent deception is well-integrated, and the "orbits of regret" concept resonates strongly in the closure. The "proof by contradiction" metaphor successfully bridges the character's mathematical background with the emotional mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately formal, fitting the heiress persona. The interiority is accessible, though the transition "After the journalist called, everything changed" is a bit functional and flat compared to the surrounding prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished but relies on several stock similes ("like a splinter," "like wallpaper chosen by a madman") that dampen the literary quality. The "correction fluid for the universe" metaphor is striking but slightly logically muddied by the red ink imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inversion of the disaster trope—hiding a near-miss rather than a collision—is a clever and specific angle. While the "secret genius father" setup is familiar, the focus on the burden of the "miss" adds a fresh layer of irony.</comment>
