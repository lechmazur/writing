<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mei Lin is compellingly drawn, with the "gravitationally unburdened" trait acting as a physical manifestation of her emotional state. The internal conflict between her pacifist identity and buried rage is dramatized effectively through the stitching action, grounding the epiphany in physical behavior rather than just thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight and coherent under a Causal/Hybrid lens, moving from the collection of the tear to the specific confrontation with the self. Closure is achieved through a Decisive Change (opening the dimension) earned by a difficult internal admission, though the final sentence ("Now only light remained") tilts slightly toward abstract sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, with the "recycled spaceship" and "salvaged memories" providing a strong thematic container. The physical constraint of happiness affecting gravity serves as an excellent micro-setting rule that shapes Mei Lin's movement and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal but is externalized effectively through the mechanics of the tears and the locked dimension. The pressure escalates naturally from the routine work on others' photos to the unavoidable confrontation with her own, forcing a re-evaluation of her self-image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of integration is resonant, but the execution relies on explicit definition ("Shadow work. The confrontation with what humanity had buried") and moralizing ("True peace required meeting the darkness first"). This didactic telling weakens the subtextual power of the stitching scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, meditative tone that suits the "ghostly resolve" required by the prompt. While the expository block on shadow work disrupts the immersion slightly, the narrative distance and perceptual signature remain controlled and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery like the "cathedral of salvaged memories." The density is high, though phrases like "liquid starfire" lean slightly toward purple; overall, the line-level craft effectively supports the story's ethereal yet grounded tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi setting with a mystical/psychological magic system (tears from photos) feels fresh. Using a physical gravity change to denote emotional states is a creative, non-obvious touch that elevates the character work.</comment>
