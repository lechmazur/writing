<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s specific vocational lens (“beautician mortician”) effectively colors her perception, giving her a distinct internal voice. However, she lacks internal contradiction or active struggle; her success relies on established competence rather than a difficult choice or personal cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution arrives with minimal resistance, creating a linear "win" rather than a complex reconfiguration. The closure relies on an explanatory summary of the character's realization rather than dramatizing the shift through action or image alone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and specific, grounding the fantastical “skyborne grotto” in the tactile reality of the protagonist’s trade (ice walls like veins, static like television snow). The setting actively supports the mood, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of escalating pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the stakes (preserving a soul) are high, the on-page conflict is strictly environmental and overcome by concentration rather than sacrifice. The lack of a live option to foreclose or a visible trade-off makes the victory feel inevitable and unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme is coherent, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph, explicitly stating the moral (“work was not merely cosmetic—it was sacred”). This explains the resonance rather than allowing the reader to experience it through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is strong and consistent, successfully filtering cosmic events through the protagonist’s specific professional expertise. The shift from technical observation to spiritual connection feels earned by this perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and polished, with high density and good momentum. A few abstract descriptors (“liminal space,” “gossamer boundary”) weaken the otherwise concrete imagery, but the line-level craft is generally high-quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes mortuary science and cosmic fantasy in a fresh way, moving beyond standard tropes. While the execution plays it safe with a linear ritual, the core concept and character identity offer a unique angle.</comment>
