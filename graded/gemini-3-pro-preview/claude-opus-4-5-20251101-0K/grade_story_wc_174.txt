<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clearly delineated and the dynamic feels lived-in. Vera’s shift from serenity to tears is rapid but justified by the release of tension in the “hush.” Marcus’s internal conflict between beauty and truth drives the narrative naturally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean, using the puppet show as an effective scene-within-a-scene to externalize the conflict. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (the symbols in the dust) that feels earned and final.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radar dome is an active participant; its acoustics ("whispered echoes") and "half-light" enable the puppet show and the final image. The environment constrains the interaction and physically shapes the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The conflict is intellectual and relational, escalated effectively by the vulnerability of the puppet performance. The stakes are felt, though the resolution comes relatively easily once the puppets are introduced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of "half-lit epiphanies" is woven seamlessly into the setting (lighting) and the action. The puppet show serves as a thematic mirror without feeling overly didactic, though the dialogue leans slightly philosophical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, balancing atmospheric description with dialogue. Control of psychic distance is strong, staying close to Marcus’s perception of the acoustics and the mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and polished ("silence held the quality of meteor hush"). Rhythms match the pacing of the "hush" well. No significant artifacts or overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a decommissioned radar dome, calligraphy, and puppetry creates a fresh, specific vessel for a relationship story. The metaphors feel organic to this specific combination of elements.</comment>
