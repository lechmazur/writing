<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is a competent focalizer with a clear goal, but her internal landscape is relatively static. She overcomes the central obstacle with immediate confidence and a convenient diary entry rather than a struggle that tests her "resourceful" trait in the moment. The "arcane linguist" skill feels more like a magic key than a developed perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal path to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure, but the turning point relies heavily on the diary providing the exact answer ("It keeps us safe") right when needed. The Time Traveler's warning of "seventeen failures" is deflated too easily by Mira's instant success, reducing the structural tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the physical (granite, root systems) with the metaphysical (unlearned lessons) in a way that actively shapes the plot. The imagery of coordinates in chlorophyll patterns and a breathing mountain library establishes a distinct, immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared high by the Time Traveler (death, loops) but feel low on the page because Mira meets no active resistance. The mountain yields to her first attempt at communication without exacting a visible price or forcing a difficult trade-off, making the victory feel unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of "listening vs. taking" is coherent and lands a clear message about the nature of wisdom. However, the delivery borders on didactic, with characters explicitly stating the subtext ("The mountain doesn't trap people... It rescues them") rather than letting it emerge organically from friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, fitting the magical realism tone. There is a tendency toward slightly purple abstractions ("sunlight waited like a question"), but the narrative distance and control remain stable throughout the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense with imagery, though it occasionally leans on stock literary phrases ("smelling of ozone and regret"). Rhythm and syntax are competent, supporting the dreamlike quality of the narrative without major stumbling blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a living mountain library with a time-loop warning offers a fresh aesthetic on the "dungeon rescue" trope. While the "empathy for the monster" resolution is familiar, the specific execution via linguistic archaeology and botanical maps feels imaginative.</comment>
