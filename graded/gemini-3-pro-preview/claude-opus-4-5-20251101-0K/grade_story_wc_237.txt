<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal struggle is perfectly externalized via the ice mechanic, allowing her interiority to drive the plot. Her decision to write on her own skin is a decisive, high-agency choice that reconfigures her limitations into a tool, earning the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a climax that resolves the immediate threat. However, the penultimate paragraph ("She would explain... She would write...") intellectualizes the victory with a future-tense summary, slightly diluting the immediacy of the closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting acts as an active constraint rather than a backdrop; the "breath between storms" creates a functional ticking clock, and the specific atmospheric conditions (cold, wind) directly enable the magic system and the protagonist's solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly defined and felt, moving effectively from paralyzing fear to active transformation. The pressure is coherent under the Situational lens, though the cost remains largely internal and aesthetic rather than a heavy external price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming trauma is woven well through the imagery, but the narrative explicitly states the moral ("space between terrors was not empty") in the final moments. This overt "telling" reduces the subtextual power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and tightly focalized, blending technical magic details with visceral emotion. The modulation of psychic distance—from the panic of the memory to the calm of the ritual—is handled with excellent control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and dense with high momentum ("spilled ink," "glittering sheets"). While a few phrases border on ornamental ("churned with the memory"), the overall execution is precise, rhythmic, and free of scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the tea ceremony, rune magic, and the specific "ice-on-skin" trauma response creates a fresh, memorable magic system. The story successfully transforms standard fantasy tropes into a specific, character-driven experience.</comment>
