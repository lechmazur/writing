<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is competent but static; her primary conflict (impatience vs. patience) is resolved in backstory rather than dramatized through present-moment micro-choices. She faces no immediate resistance that forces a character-defining decision on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is linear and convenient, with key developments (discovering the viaduct) occurring without struggle. Closure lands on a thematic reflection rather than a paid cost; the ending feels like a completed checklist rather than a dramatic resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details ("ribs of some ancient leviathan," "ice groaned") that ground the speculative elements. The setting actively supports the mood, though the "stone in chest" imagery is slightly clichéd.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>There is a near-total absence of immediate on-page pressure or antagonism; the Empire is an abstract threat and the environment offers no resistance. Success feels inevitable from the start, lacking the tightening of stakes required for engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but heavily didactic, relying on explicit thesis statements in the final paragraphs ("revolution was not a moment but a process") instead of allowing meaning to emerge organically from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a suitable distance that matches the "vigilant mapper" persona. It effectively sustains the contemplative tone, though it occasionally lapses into summary over scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "softly purposeful" is integrated awkwardly, creating a grammatical error ("worked softly purposeful"). While the rhythm is generally good, the prose relies on several clichés ("grief like a stone," "pale fire") that dull the impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core concept of "horizon mapping" to predict magnetic storms for revolution is inventive and fresh. This ingenuity lifts the story above its standard "lonely watcher" structure, even if the plot execution is safe.</comment>
