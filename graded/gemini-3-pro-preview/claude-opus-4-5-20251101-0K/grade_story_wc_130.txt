<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and the internal conflict regarding "ambiguous loss" is well-defined. However, interiority often relies on diagnostic statements ("Ambiguous loss carved stranger wounds") rather than embodied experience, and the emotional resolution feels slightly processed through therapy-speak rather than raw reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The structure is solid, following a clear causal chain from preparation to ritual to realization. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of her grief. The climax relies heavily on the apparition explicitly explaining the story's lesson, which weakens the dramatic tension of the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct; the "mathematics of sustenance" in the dripping water nicely parallels the protagonist's internal logic. The environment actively supports the magical realism tone and grounds the abstract concepts in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are established early (sanity/closure vs. grief), and the ritual provides a clear pressure point. The resolution comes too easily; the protagonist accepts the entity's explanation and shifts to optimism without a significant on-page struggle or cost at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story relies on explicit thematic statements ("The mathematics of emotion wasn't about locating the lost. It was about...") rather than subtext. The apparition articulates the moral directly, reducing the resonance and leaving little work for the reader.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "intellectual mage" persona. There is a slight overuse of filter verbs ("She knew," "She saw," "She believed"), but the tone remains cohesive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from high metaphor density that occasionally drifts into abstraction ("half-life of hope," "volume of silence"). Some phrases feel like prompt insertions rather than organic descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of applying mathematics to grief and magic is fresh and engaging. The execution, specifically the "ghost explains the theme" trope, is less original, but the synthesis of setting and character motivation is strong.</comment>
