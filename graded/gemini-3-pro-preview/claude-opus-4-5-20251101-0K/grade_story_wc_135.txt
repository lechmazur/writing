<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by retrospective summary and innate ability ("reactive vision") rather than active choices made under pressure in the present. Emotional beats are narrated ("dignity of understanding") instead of dramatized in scene, rendering the character passive and the internal landscape static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrative relies heavily on montage ("Day after day," "Families began visiting") rather than constructing a distinct scene with urgent causality. This summarizing approach flattens the arc, preventing a genuine climax or an on-page closure unit derived from specific action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like the "limestone quays" and the "verdigris" on the valve are vivid and establish a consistent mood. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop rather than providing physical constraints or tactical resources that pressure the protagonist's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Conflict is retrospective; the opposing council is gone, and the protagonist's work proceeds without obstruction, risk, or opposition. The narrative lacks a high-stakes moment where the character must face a difficult trade-off or active resistance to achieve her goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme is articulated through explicit thesis statements ("navigated absences often revealed more than presence") rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. This didactic "telling" preempts reader engagement and renders the resonance abstract rather than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative distance is excessive, relying on a "helpful narrator" to explain the character's traits and backstory ("Elena’s gift had always been...") rather than immersing the reader in immediate perception. This explanatory stance distances the reader from the emotional core.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is competent but slowed by filter verbs ("She noticed," "She found") and relies on passive constructions that dull momentum. Phrase insertions like "reactively visionary quality" feel clunky and disrupt the rhythm, reading more like prompt-checking than natural description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the concept of an archivist for shipwrecks is evocative, the execution follows a safe, low-stakes trajectory of healing without complication. The lack of narrative risk, subversion, or immediate scene drama results in a vignette that feels familiar and safe.</comment>
