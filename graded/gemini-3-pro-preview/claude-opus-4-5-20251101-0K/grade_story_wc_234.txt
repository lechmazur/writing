<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's central realization is delivered to her by Theo ("I know why you're really going... It's in the attention") rather than earned through her own struggle, rendering her somewhat passive in the climax. However, her decision to gift the shell constitutes a solid on-page action that creates genuine cost, recovering agency at the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc with a legible closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) anchored by the transfer of the shell. The pacing is effective, and the orientation within the nexus is handled well without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the thermal vents and "geothermal whispers" providing excellent atmospheric pressure that contrasts with the "frozen time" of the shell. The environment feels lived-in and integral to the alchemical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing presence) is signaled early and resolves with a tangible cost—Mira giving up the object of her three-year obsession. While the conflict is primarily philosophical dialogue, the physical price paid at the end validates the internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its moral in the final paragraph ("the weight of presence was simply love, paying attention"), which flattens the subtext and triggers the sermonizing penalty. The theme is articulated in dialogue rather than emerging organically from the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the fantasy setting. The POV remains stable with Mira, though some interiority feels slightly summarized rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished, though occasionally overwritten (e.g., "palette of resolve reforming with new colors" is a mixed/clunky metaphor). Rhythm and clarity are generally strong, maintaining momentum through the dialogue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of "pocket-sun alchemy" is fresh, but the "Academy departure" and "presence equals attention" epiphany are standard literary tropes. The execution is competent but lacks a surprising angle on the core theme.</comment>
