<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's internal drive to preserve the craft is clear and grounded, but Petra relies on stock "feisty" cues (sharp elbows, sass) rather than nuanced agency. The relationship dynamic feels familiar and low-stakes, leaning on standard banter ("Respect your elders") rather than specific, pressure-driven interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and the closure—reconfiguring the "deciduous vows" through the passing of the ribbon—lands effectively. However, the trajectory is linear with minimal causal complication; the discovery of the bag is convenient, lacking a "tightening" beat where failure seemed possible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard is a vivid, arresting concept that anchors the story's tone; "apple trees rooted in centuries of accumulated dust" is excellent. The setting actively shapes the verticality of the scene, though the sensory details of the climb itself could be more tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the stakes of losing generational knowledge are established, immediate scene pressure is low; the obstacles are merely physical (climbing) rather than antagonistic. The resolution comes through discovery rather than a hard choice or sacrifice on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "deciduous vows" concept elegantly bridges the natural setting and the guild's history, offering a resonant metaphor for resilience. The thematic execution is slightly didactic in dialogue ("That's what the deciduous vows mean"), but the final image creates genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and Mira's voice is consistent, but the dialogue drifts into generic fantasy rhythms ("stubborn creature," "triply cursed"). The narrative distance is well-controlled, though the "endearingly feisty" descriptor is a breach of show-don't-tell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with strong imagery ("color of fog," "green snow"). However, the text relies on some adjectival telling ("endearingly feisty") and the dialogue often feels like scaffolding rather than organic speech.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a quartz-tech magic system with an arboreal cathedral setting is fresh and memorable. While the "passing the torch" plot is standard, the specific context of the "deciduous vows" elevates the premise above generic post-collapse fantasy.</comment>
