<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The protagonist functions primarily as a vessel for the theme rather than a living character; traits like "rationally rebellious" are told as labels rather than demonstrated through difficult action. Internal conflict is summarized ("agonized") instead of dramatized through active choices under immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc (find, reflect, cache), and the closure (Earned Stasis) is legible. However, the lack of causal density gives it a vignette quality; the decision to hide the artifact feels inevitable rather than earned by overcoming resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details ("verdigris," "oiled leather") grounding the abstract concepts. The "sedimentary layers" functioning as physical strata of history provides a compelling, concrete constraint on the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely theoretical; the external pressure (chanting) is ambient and does not force a tactical shift or distinct risk. The conflict stays safely within the protagonist's head, lacking a scene-level test of his convictions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Competing narratives, all claiming exclusive access to reality") rather than subtext. The story relies on essayistic summary to explain its meaning, reducing narrative resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but creates unnecessary distance through filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "he could hear"). The tone matches the contemplative subject matter but often slips into abstract summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant repetitive phrasing ("abrasive calm" and "agonized" both appear twice; "narrative" appears five times) creates a looping effect. Abstract nouns and clunky constructions ("The rational part of his rebellion demanded") reduce line-level impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the "stratigraphy of truth" concept is imaginative, the execution leans on the familiar trope of the lonely post-apocalyptic archivist. The story intellectualizes its premise rather than finding a fresh, dramatic angle on it.</comment>
