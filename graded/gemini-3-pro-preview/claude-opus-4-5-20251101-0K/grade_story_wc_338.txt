<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena’s professional background as a map framer authentically shapes her perception, driving the central metaphor of "spaces between lines." Her motivation to interpret silence with empathy is dramatized through her interaction with the footage rather than just stated. The choice to remain and report despite the encroaching supernatural threat demonstrates earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, gathering evidence until the pressure forces a stance crystallization. The closure—writing the report while the chapel wakes—lands with a distinct resonant reconfiguration of the threat. The pacing perfectly matches the "slow erosion" motif established in the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is active and distinct; the damp stone, the fading pigment, and the "tear" in the painted map are not just backdrop but the primary evidence driving the plot. The final image of the shadows reaching like hands charges the closure with visceral environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is managed well through the video comparison, moving from subtle pigment changes to impossible movement. The conflict between the Council's technical demands and Elena's empathetic intuition provides a solid frame for the internal stakes. The cost is felt in the menacing attention the chapel turns upon her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of boundaries—between map and territory, past and present, silence and speech—is woven tightly into the plot mechanics. The "tear" in the map serves as a potent symbol that resolves into the "whisper" of the ending without feeling didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, matching the protagonist's "methodical" nature. While the phrase "shielded openness" is a slight tell, the overall narrative distance is well-calibrated to the atmospheric mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose quality is high, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery like "patient as prayer" and "differences accumulated like evidence of a crime." Information density is excellent, and there are no significant scaffold artifacts or repetitive loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of map-framing theory with supernatural archaeological horror is fresh and specific. Using the comparison of vintage and modern footage as the primary investigative tool offers a unique, textured angle on the "haunted place" trope.</comment>
