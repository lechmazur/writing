<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s internal conflict—artistic success vs. the desire for "true" perception—is dramatized with precision, driving the narrative arc. The attribute "innocently cunning" is well-integrated, manifesting in her calculated preparation of the plant arrangement to negotiate a mystical trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is flawless; the trade mechanic establishes a clear before/after state with a visible, paid cost (the reed and her "familiar darkness"). Closure is definitive and lands with a resonant reconfiguration of her artistic identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting actively pressures the scene, from the "residual heat" of the phoenix to the specific transformation of the glass shards from grey to "impossible emerald." The environment anchors the metaphysical change in concrete sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are existential and explicitly raised by Theo's warning that the change "might destroy everything you've built." Mira's active acceptance of this risk elevates the climax beyond a simple transaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in brokenness coheres well through the imagery of the glass and the "cracks in the flames." The score is capped slightly because the final sentence explicates the theme ("That was the beauty...") rather than trusting the powerful image of the ash and gold to stand alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice expertly filters the world through Mira’s limited palette before the switch, making the burst of color viscerally effective. The perceptual shift is handled with rigorous control, maintaining the POV's specific vocabulary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically distinct and dense with functional imagery ("ash and amber," "weight of a small ghost"). There is zero scaffold or synonym churn; every sentence advances the atmosphere or the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the phoenix aftermath with a disability narrative feels fresh and grounded. While the "trade for sight" is a familiar trope, the specific cost (trading grief/darkness) and the focus on imperfection offer a nuanced execution.</comment>
