<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is competent and her motivation is clear, but she lacks internal contradiction or meaningful micro-choices; the "obsession" is stated rather than dramatized through complex tradeoffs. The physical cost (bleeding fingers) feels like a standard genre trope rather than a character-specific price paid for a difficult decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative structure is solid, effectively using the dying stars as a countdown to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure. However, the plot is strictly linear and procedural—the oracle simply waits and performs the ritual—lacking a moment where the plan fractures or requires tactical adaptation under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet is an excellent, tactile object that grounds the magic system in specific sensory detail. The setting establishes atmosphere well, though descriptors like "screaming gales" lean into cliché and the "darkness" remains a somewhat generic void.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the global stakes are apocalyptic, the immediate scene conflict is low; the protagonist faces endurance rather than active opposition or dilemma. The escalation relies on the external clock (stars dying) rather than the protagonist's agency forcing a narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "summarizing silence" is poetic and creates a coherent, resonant ending about navigability rather than victory. The resolution borders on moralizing ("not entirely without paths"), but the central image of the map successfully anchors the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic distance appropriate for a fable, with controlled pacing during the ritual. The phrasing "mildly obsessed" jars slightly against the elevated register, reading more like a prompt insertion than organic characterization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm is generally strong, but the proximity of "ambered hush" (para 5) and "marbled hush" (para 9) creates a distracting synonym loop. Phrases like "screaming gales" and "curious and cold" reduce freshness, preventing entry into higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of recording dying starlight onto flaking gold leaf to create a map is a fresh, evocative synthesis of image and mechanic. The surrounding frame of a lone watcher facing an encroaching dark void is familiar, but the specific tool elevates the execution.</comment>
