<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and drives the action, and the specific choice to risk the heirloom wing adds necessary weight. However, her internal state relies on slightly performative literary markers ("wept without sound," "relic of grief") rather than idiosyncratic, embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent and the closure—the butterfly interacting with the wing—is resonant and earns its emotional payoff. The "knot-reading" logic borders on magical realism but fits the established premise; the ending effectively reconfigures the loss into an act of witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The atmosphere is established, but the description relies on clichés ("clouds parted like curtains") and vague abstractions ("impossible green," "frozen melody") rather than precise, grounding sensory details. The grotto itself feels a bit generic beyond the constructed frames.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stakes (extinction/witness) are clear and the pressure of the timeline is felt. The conflict is largely internal and static (waiting for the inevitable), which works for the tone but limits dynamic tension; the cost is accepted rather than fought, leading to Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but the story lacks confidence in the reader's ability to grasp it, resulting in explicit moralizing ("Permanence wasn't the point. Witness was," "Your journey mattered"). This over-explanation flattens the subtext into text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, suiting the "esoteric realist" persona. However, it occasionally slips into "writerly" affectation or explains the protagonist's philosophy ("truth wore strange clothes") rather than letting it emerge through observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While functional, the prose is hampered by stock similes ("parted like curtains," "river of fire") and abstract metaphors ("frozen melody") that reduce immediacy. The repetition of the required phrase "blushing stillness" feels forced rather than rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core invention—using knotted ropes as a tactile language to communicate with butterflies—is highly original and specific. This fresh concept elevates the otherwise familiar "last of a species" trope significantly.</comment>
