<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias is a distinct, well-drawn eccentric whose internal logic justifies the supernatural elements. His transition from a passive archivist of "borrowed memories" to an active agent seeking closure for another represents a clear Decisive Change. The emotional weight of his choice is felt, grounded in a consistent character history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the "observing gaps" mechanism to bridge the physical investigation and the supernatural climax effectively. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the protagonist's status quo with clear intent, though the alignment of dates feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the mist and the "opal dock" do not merely provide atmosphere but actively constrain the timing of events and charge the final image. The sensory specificity ("bruised light," "pale finger") firmly anchors the ethereal elements in a physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story maintains a coherent, quiet pressure that escalates from intellectual curiosity to a burden of moral responsibility. While the external conflict is subtle, the internal shift—accepting the weight of the stranger's grief and breaking his own isolation—provides a legible felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The exploration of memory and silence is resonant and well-integrated. However, the logbook entry ("love stayed stubborn as alpine flowers") explicitly articulates the theme in a way that feels slightly prescriptive, trading subtext for a summary statement, though the action itself earns the moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical distance that suits the "witnessed isolation" tone. The transition into the borrowed memory is handled with excellent control, shifting focus without breaking the established point of view or psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and polished, with strong rhythmic control. The opening paragraph leans slightly into adjectival stacking ("opal," "iridescent," "bruised"), but the writing quickly settles into precise, evocative imagery that advances the plot without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the "lonely lighthouse keeper" is a familiar trope, the synthesis with the "logbook gaps" puzzle and the specific mechanics of the "borrowed memories" creates a fresh narrative angle. The execution elevates the premise beyond its standard components.</comment>
