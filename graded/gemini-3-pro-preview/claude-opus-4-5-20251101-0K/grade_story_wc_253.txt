<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's coping mechanism of narrating her life creates a distinct, layered interiority that effectively reveals her performer background. The dissonance between her performed "blankness" and internal heaviness is embodied well in the dishwashing and whittling beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear Situational Drive Lens, accumulating pressure through the mundane tasks under surveillance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where she solidifies her "remade hush" as a survival tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The wind turbines are effectively used not just as scenery but as a rhythmic constraint ("shadows sweeping... like the hands of a broken clock"). The dried bouquet and whittling wood provide necessary tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stakes (sanity/compliance) are clear, and the drone pass offers a moment of external pressure. However, the conflict remains largely internal and the "mandate" feels like a standard dystopian trope rather than a unique pressure cooker.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story explicitly explains its theme ("Mira understood something the legislators didn't...") rather than letting the subtext do the work. This moralizing summary in the final third reduces resonance and feels didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shift between the theatrical "protagonist" narration and Mira's grounded internal thoughts is handled with strong control. The voice aligns well with the character's background as a performer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the imagery is solid, the prose relies too heavily on expository scaffolding ("This was the only way she remembered," "This was how she cultivated lightness"). This telling reduces the density and literary impact of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "forced happiness" dystopia is a familiar trope. The specific angle of a performer narrating their own mundane tragedy adds a fresh texture, but the core premise and moral conclusion feel well-trodden.</comment>
