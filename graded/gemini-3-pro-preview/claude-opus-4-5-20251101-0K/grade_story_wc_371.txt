<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is rich and specific, grounding the abstract concept of "noticing" in concrete sensory details. Her motivation is consistent, though the shift from rage to "heuristically gentle" observation is summarized rather than dramatized in a present-tense crucible, which keeps the emotional arc slightly static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens works well here, gathering evidence of erasure before culminating in the ritual of planting. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where planting becomes a refusal to forget—lands with clear logic, though the "weight" of memory is told more than felt through active resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful; the overgrown jasmine and the "ghost" of the bakery smell anchor the memory theme physically. The tea house feels like a necessary sanctuary for the action, engaging the senses beyond just the visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (memory vs. erasure), lacking a sharp external pressure or antagonist to force a harder choice. While the stakes are clear, the escalation is gentle; the "tightening" comes from the decision to plant the seeds now, which is a quiet turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme is poignant but articulated too explicitly in interiority ("Finding the sacred in the ordinary was not escapism..."), which triggers the Thematic Echo penalty. The imagery of the spider and the seeds carries the theme better than the direct thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, meditative, and consistent with the melancholic atmosphere. The distance is appropriate for a reflective piece, though there is a slight tendency to rely on filter verbs ("She noticed," "She knew") rather than direct immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative ("swallowed the small wooden structure," "ghost of its original sweetness"). The insertion of the prompt phrase "heuristically gentle" creates a slight register clash with the poetic tone, requiring an immediate explanatory appositive that slows the rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "guerrilla gardening" with the preservation of memory against a magical-realist erasure is a fresh, specific concept. It transforms the familiar trope of "fighting forgetting" into a tangible, grounded action.</comment>
