<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's internal landscape of professional exhaustion and persistent duty is rendered with specific, embodied detail ("clipboard... like armor"). Her worldview is coherent and drives the narrative, though the generals feel slightly archetypal and their dialogue overly symmetrical ("My son..."/"My daughter..."), which flattens the interpersonal texture slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scene is structurally sound with clear orientation and a legible drive lens (Situational/Atmospheric). The closure works as Earned Stasis—peace as endurance—but the central turn (the signing) meets little on-page resistance, resolving the immediate tension with efficient dialogue rather than a more difficult tactical struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and atmospheric, utilizing the "twin shadows" and "wildflowers... between the bones" to support the mood. While some elements lean toward fantasy staples (Valley of Echoes, twin moons), the specific sensory details (torches guttering, worn limestone) effectively ground the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (peace) is clear, but the escalation is mild; the opposition from the generals dissolves after a single exchange of dialogue. While the conceptual cost (endurance) is legible, the lack of deeper on-page tactical friction or a harder choice for Elara limits the sense of rising pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of peace as practice is coherent and resonates with the protagonist's arc. However, the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("Redemption... was not a single payment but a lifetime of installments") to summarize the thesis, which triggers the penalty for replacing scene pressure with thematic statement in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, solemn control that suits Elara's weary professionalism. The distance is well-managed, staying close to her perception, and the rhythmic cadence of the prose supports the ritualistic atmosphere without slipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density and strong imagery ("roots tangled through ribcages"). A few phrases feel slightly ornamental ("bleeding across the horizon"), but the line-level craft is generally precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Focusing on the administrative, exhausted side of high-fantasy peace negotiations is a strong, grounded angle. The execution—a treaty signing under celestial alignment—is a familiar trope, but the character's perspective on "peace as exhaustion" adds a layer of freshness.</comment>
