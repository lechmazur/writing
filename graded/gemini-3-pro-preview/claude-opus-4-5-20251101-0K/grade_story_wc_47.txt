<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization as a "watchful dreamer" is not merely labeled but enacted through her attention to the moss, directly fueling the "quietly proactive" closure. The transition from observer to participant is earned by her internal processing of the pendant's meaning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds well; the convergence of the environmental detail (thaw patterns) and the sister's arrival leads to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure—an offering that recontextualizes the "trapped" moth—lands with earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is exemplary; the abandoned data center isn't just scenery but a thematic engine that frames the "tech yielded to tenderness" concept. The specific detail of the drip-line moss pattern grounds the metaphor in concrete causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pressure from the viral confession is established early and escalates through Thea's arrival, forcing a stance crystallization. The resolution is quiet—perhaps slightly too smooth given the described magnitude of the betrayal—but the emotional cost of sharing the pendant is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thematic integration is strong until the final paragraph, which explicitly summarizes the thesis ("wholeness wasn't the goal. Growth was"). This explanatory sermonizing replaces the resonance of the final image, triggering the specific deduction for theme statements in the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical distance that suits the "honeyed hush" atmosphere. The POV filter is rigorous, ensuring all observations—from the server racks to the moth—reflect Mira's specific emotional logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. While "emerald velvet" leans slightly purple, the line-level craft largely supports the story's atmospheric weight without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of the reclaimed data center with the narrative of digital exposure (the viral video) offers a fresh, specific frame for a reconciliation story. The execution elevates familiar tropes of grief through this distinct setting.</comment>
