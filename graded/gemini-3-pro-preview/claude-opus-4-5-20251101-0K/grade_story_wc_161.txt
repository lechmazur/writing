<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's internal landscape is vivid, and the specific backstory of the pigeon scandal grounds her trauma effectively. The choice to confess feels earned by the preceding introspection and the meteorite's symbolism, creating a cohesive character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is decisive and resonant, with the confession marking a clear irreversible change in Elara's strategy. However, the heavy reliance on summary to bridge the timeline between the meteorite's arrival and Mira's visits dilutes the scenic tension compared to a continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The attic atmosphere is palpable, with the dust motes and skylight serving as effective micro-setting elements that ground the character's state. The meteorite provides a tangible, specific anchor for the cosmic themes that elevates the setting beyond a generic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The stakes of anonymity versus connection are clearly established and tested by Mira's question. The cost of the confession—the loss of safety—is felt, though the "blooming" resolution softens the blow somewhat quickly, reducing the lingering sense of risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The thematic parallel between the pigeons, the meteorite, and Elara is strong, but the ending resorts to explicit moralizing. The final journal entry ("Trust... is learning") summarizes the theme rather than letting the image resonate on its own, triggering the penalty for sermonizing endings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the reflective mood. However, it occasionally slips into sentimentality ("small hearts," "songs we carry"), which slightly distances the reader from the raw reality of the trauma.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished but suffers from overwritten similes ("bloomed in her chest like the first flower") and some clichés ("shed like dead skin"). These flourishes distract from the otherwise strong imagery of the dust and the stone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a courier pigeon trainer for a corrupt telecom is highly original and adds a fresh layer to the "hiding in a bookshop" trope. The synthesis of corporate scandal and cosmic time through the meteorite is ingenious.</comment>
