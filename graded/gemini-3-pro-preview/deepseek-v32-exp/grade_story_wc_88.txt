<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is delivered through abstract labels ("empathy-starved," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied struggle. The internal conflict is resolved instantly upon catching the ball, lacking the erratic, contradictory human behavior required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear path with no causal friction; obstacles (the labyrinth, the reflection) do not push back. The resolution is a soft reset where the cost is explicitly negated ("not as burdens, but as lessons"), failing the requirement for a felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The setting is visually described but lacks physical consequence; the "labyrinth" behaves like a straight hallway with no spatial constraints or wrong turns. Sensory details are generic ("damp and cool," "ethereal light") rather than specific to the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Stakes are theoretical; there is no immediate external pressure or antagonist forcing a choice. The climax is a transaction (throwing a ball) rather than a high-stakes dilemma, and the emotional cost is waived in the exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing statements ("He realized that kindling empathy meant...") rather than subtext. The story preaches its message instead of allowing it to emerge from the dramatic action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice relies heavily on filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized," "he saw") and diagnostic summary, creating distance. The prose explains the character's state to the reader rather than allowing the voice to inhabit that state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Prose is weighed down by clichés ("clean slate," "stubborn stain") and visible scaffolding where prompt phrases are pasted in verbatim ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder" both appear twice). These repetitions act as text artifacts that break immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the prompt elements into a standard redemption trope without fresh insight. The "time traveler" element feels disconnected from the "memory wipe" logic, resulting in a checklist feel rather than an organic whole.</comment>
