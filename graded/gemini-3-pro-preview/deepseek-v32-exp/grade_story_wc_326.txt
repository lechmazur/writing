<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elara is a passive protagonist who observes the climax rather than enacting it; the ghost guides the resolution while she simply watches. Emotions are summarized with diagnostic labels ("haunted," "reckless confidence") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The story relies on a "soft reset" resolution where trauma is resolved instantly by looking at ink, lacking a felt cost or logical mechanism. The causal link between "defragmenting data" and "spilled ink" is asserted rather than established, breaking narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting feels like a "white room" with isolated props; the "opal observatory" and "spilled ink" are visually described but lack spatial grounding or functional interaction. The environment does not constrain the character's movement or choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared but not tested; the ghost appears immediately to facilitate the solution, removing any genuine obstacle or risk of failure. The process of "defragmenting" proceeds smoothly without setbacks, resulting in low narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("failure was not a monster, but a teacher") rather than emerging organically from the action. This didactic approach flattens the subtext and resolves complex grief with a platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is overly distant and expository ("Her motivation was singular"), explaining the character's state instead of inhabiting it. This filtering distances the reader from the "visceral" memory the text claims to depict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Phrasing often relies on abstract nouns ("luminescence," "solace") rather than concrete particulars, and a typo ("a artifact") mars the polish. The clash between digital metaphors ("defragment") and physical ones (ink divination) creates a confused aesthetic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>While the "death certificate error" is an intriguing concept, it is underdeveloped and serves only as backstory. The core narrative of a ghost returning to help a survivor process trauma is a standard trope executed here without a transformative twist.</comment>
