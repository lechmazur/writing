<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on diagnostic labeling ("reticent," "warmly observant") rather than dramatization. The protagonist's motivation is explicitly stated in summary ("Elian's motivation... was to bottle the feeling of safety") rather than revealed through high-pressure choices or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Causality suffers from a significant logic gap: Elian prioritizes building a stone cairn on the beach while the primary light is out, undermining the urgency of the crisis. The fate of the current keeper is a loose thread that leaves the ending's stability in question (leaving the tower unmanned again).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The setting is established with decent sensory details like the "tidal polish" of the glass. However, atmospheric descriptions occasionally veer into abstraction ("luminescent ache") rather than grounding the supernatural elements in concrete, visceral experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes feel low despite the "protect" mandate; the haunting manifests only as coldness and is resolved by the procedural act of lighting the lamp without demanding a significant sacrifice or trade-off from Elian. The resolution comes too easily, lacking a sense of earned cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through direct exposition in the letters and narration ("chain not of fear, but of shared vigilance") rather than emerging organically from the action. The final realization feels asserted rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodramatic phrasing ("lingering echoes of drowned sailors' hopes") that distances the reader. The perspective remains stable, though interiority is often summarized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is functional but marred by telling ("He understood now") and clunky sentence structures ("Elian's motivation... was to"). The repetition of the specific phrase "luminescent ache" reads as an unintentional artifact rather than a motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse concept is handled with standard tropes, offering little innovation. The "cairn language" is a fresh idea but is structurally misplaced, serving as a distraction from the primary conflict rather than an integral twist.</comment>
