<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characterization relies on labels ("lyrical code breaker") rather than traits revealed through friction. The internal arc is summarized ("to hide her fears so well") rather than dramatized; the protagonist succeeds instantly without genuine struggle or error.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear sequence of successful actions with no causality or obstacles; the "magic" solution (dancing) resolves every lock without cost. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction but lacks the required decisive change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details ("green light," "algae") are functional but do not constrain the protagonist, who explicitly ignores the environment's pressure. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is static; declared threats (crushing weight, ghosts) exert no pressure, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The resolution is unearned, as the "code" yields immediately to the protagonist's specific skills without trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit authorial explanation ("strength in the admission of weakness") rather than subtext. The story tells the reader what to feel instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is overly interpretive, summarizing the significance of actions ("narrative of resistance") rather than grounding them in sensory immediacy. The distance prevents emotional engagement with the stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive subject-verb sentence structures ("She worked," "She began," "Her dance"). Abstract nouns and "telling" dominate ("narrated the transformation"), and key phrases are repeated verbatim as artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes prompt elements mechanically, resulting in a "checklist" feel. The central conceit (dancing to decode) operates on dream logic without established rules, lowering dramatic tension.</comment>
