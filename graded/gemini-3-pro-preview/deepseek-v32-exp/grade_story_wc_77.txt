<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal state relies heavily on stated emotions ("command feeling like a violation," "strange peace") rather than embodied reactions. The "resuscitation" backstory provides a unique hook but remains a told fact rather than a physical or psychological constraint shaping her choices in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear instruction-execution loop (advisor speaks, Elara obeys) rather than protagonist-driven discovery. Closure lacks a legible cost; Elara discards a cursed object she wanted to lose, resulting in a net gain without sacrifice, violating the "visible cost" requirement for high-band closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The funhouse atmosphere is cohesive and mirrors the internal distortion, but relies on standard tropes ("gaping maw," "rotten cotton candy"). Specificity is functional, yet the setting feels like a generic backdrop for the magical confrontation rather than a unique pressure cooker.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Escalation is low; the antagonist (the shadow) poses no active threat that forces Elara to adapt or fail. The resolution is immediate upon confession, lacking the back-and-forth struggle or narrowing of options required for genuine narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader by the advisor ("Fear is a paradox") and the narrator ("unbosomed her terror and found strength"), rather than emerging organically from the action. This over-articulation flattens subtext into summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the gothic tone, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, it occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from clunky, adjective-heavy phrasing ("photographically cursed," "repulsive allure") and cliché ("gaping maw," "pure white erupted"). The archaic verb "unbosom" is used awkwardly, disrupting the rhythm and feeling forced rather than natural to the voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>While the combination of a cursed photograph and a dream dictionary is novel, the execution falls into the familiar "mirror confrontation" trope. The resolution—throwing an object at a mirror to break a curse—feels mechanical and lacks a fresh conceptual twist.</comment>
