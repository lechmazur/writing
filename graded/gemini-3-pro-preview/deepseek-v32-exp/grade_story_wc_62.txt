<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is abstractly asserted ("discover the shape of collective grief") rather than dramatized through urgent need. Internal conflict is absent; the protagonist follows external instructions without struggle or contradictory impulses. Emotional states are labeled ("profound peace") rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The narrative relies on a summary bridge ("Over days") that dissolves the scene's tension into a montage, breaking the single-window scope without a clear transition. Causality is weak; the protagonist succeeds simply by obeying a ghost, facing no obstacles. Closure is an abstract thematic summary rather than a dramatic event with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The setting details (greenhouse, ivy, glass) are competent but function largely as ornamental backdrop rather than constraining choice. The atmosphere relies on oxymoronic telling ("thundering calm") rather than sensory pressure. Spatial anchoring is adequate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>There is no meaningful opposition or scarcity; the ghost and nature cooperate fully with the protagonist's goals. Stakes remain abstract ("shape of grief") and are never threatened or tested. The protagonist pays no price for her revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("grief was not a void but a network") rather than subtext or action. The ending sermonizes, reducing the narrative to a vehicle for a moral statement. The prompt's thematic requirements are pasted onto the surface.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The narrator is overly helpful, explaining the meaning of every symbol and action ("each ribbon representing a soul"). The voice slides into summary frequently. Point of view is consistent but distant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Significant repetitive artifacts: the phrase "thundering calm" appears three times, and "fiercely meditative" twice, reading as forced insertions. The prose leans heavily on telling ("Her motivation was...") and abstract nouns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The premise of a ghostly mentor providing easy closure in a garden is a familiar trope executed here without subversion. The reliance on summary and abstract realization prevents any fresh synthesis of the elements.</comment>
