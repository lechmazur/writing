<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is a competent functionary of the plot rather than a conflicted individual; he faces obstacles with immediate "surge of purpose" rather than doubt or struggle. While the motivation is clear, the lack of internal friction or contradictory impulses makes him feel archetypal and one-note. The character lacks the flaws or blind spots required to generate genuine narrative tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal path, but the resolution relies on the protagonist's perfect competence, lacking the "visible or felt cost" required for high-band closure. The ending reads as a "win-state" where the threat is neutralized into beauty without a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice. The narrative arc is functional but mechanically tidy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The setting is vivid, distinct, and integral to the narrative; the "improbable orchard" on the open sea creates a strong, specific atmosphere. Environmental details like the "blue hour" and "driftwood" effectively ground the fantastical elements. The setting actively provides the obstacles (silence, wave) that drive the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Escalation is present (silence to wave), but the protagonist's lack of fear ("instead of fear, he felt a surge of purpose") deflates the stakes immediately. The conflict is resolved through mastery rather than struggle, resulting in a low-tension climax where the outcome feels inevitable. The obstacle is harmonized too easily to feel like a genuine threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming obstacles into art is coherent and illustrated clearly through the action. However, the execution is somewhat on-the-nose, with the protagonist's purpose explicitly stated ("to turn obstacles into instruments") rather than emerging organically. The resonance is clear but lacks the ambiguity or depth of a higher-scoring piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the mythic tone of the setting. There is a distinct "perceptual signature" in how the prophet views the world through sound and vibration. However, the register occasionally slips into slightly technical phrasing ("fractal generating method") that jars against the fable-like texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is generally evocative and sensory-rich, though it occasionally leans into adjective-heavy description ("fragile, luminous dome," "complex, ever-evolving"). There is a tendency to "tell" the magic system's mechanics ("concept of sketched resonance") rather than letting them exist purely as image. Rhythm and momentum are solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core image of a floating citrus orchard using sound to tame waves is highly imaginative and fresh. While the "master wizard" plot archetype is standard, the specific synthesis of sound, sea, and horticulture creates a unique aesthetic. The ingenuity lies in the setting and magic system rather than the narrative arc.</comment>
