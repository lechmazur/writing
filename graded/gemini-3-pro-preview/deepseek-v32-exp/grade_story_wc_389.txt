<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The protagonist is characterized entirely through summary and abstract labels ("visionary," "lonely") rather than dramatized action or specific interiority. There is no on-page present moment where the character faces a difficult micro-choice; emotions are stated ("heart a tuning fork") rather than embodied. The narrative reads as a synopsis of a character arc rather than a lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The piece violates the scope defaults by summarizing months and years of events rather than dramatizing a single scene or defined sequence. Closure is achieved through broad narrative summary ("The rise of the prophet was complete") rather than a specific on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The lack of a grounded "now" prevents any causal linkage between specific beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("cobalt glass," "stormlit") that function as backdrops rather than constraints on action. While the imagery is consistent, it lacks the sensory specificity required to ground the reader in a physical reality or influence character tactics in a moment of crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Conflict is telescopic and abstract ("variant allegiance," "factions shifting"), resolved through summary descriptions of speeches and plans rather than dramatized confrontation. There is no escalation of pressure on the page; hurdles are cleared instantly via narration ("turning the tide of debate") without visible cost or tactical trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed labels and prompt echoes ("ancient shadows," "new dawn") rather than emerging from subtext. The narrative explicitly states the moral and the character's significance, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is elevated and flowery ("symphony of thunder and revelation"), resembling a book blurb or synopsis rather than a story. While consistent, the distance is excessive, preventing any intimacy or distinct perceptual signature beyond the manipulation of prompt keywords.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from severe artifact insertion, where prompt instructions ("gritty whimsy," "lyrically prophetic") are pasted directly into the text as descriptors. Metaphors are dense and often mixed ("statement unfolding like a map," "heart a tuning fork"), and the sentence structure relies heavily on static "The [Noun] was [Description]" patterns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story follows a generic "chosen one/advisor" template typical of YA dystopia summaries. It relies on stock tropes without offering a fresh synthesis, specific lived detail, or a unique voice to elevate the premise beyond a checklist of prompt requirements.</comment>
