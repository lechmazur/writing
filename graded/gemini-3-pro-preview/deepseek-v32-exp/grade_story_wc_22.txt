<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The protagonist is a functional vehicle for the prompt without internal depth or contradiction. Motivation is stated explicitly ("His motivation was singular") rather than dramatized through struggle or difficult choices. There is no emotional arc; he begins satisfied and ends satisfied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear procedural checklist (arrive, listen, plant, leave) lacking causal turns or complications. The closure is merely the cessation of the task, with no "felt or conceptual cost" other than the depletion of supplies. The structure lacks tension or meaningful reconfiguration of the status quo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The setting is visually established with some competent imagery ("thin finger of stone"), but often relies on telling rather than sensory immersion ("narrow vastness" is labeled, not felt). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the birds, the soil, and the spirits cooperate immediately without resistance. There is no escalation, trade-off, or risk of failure; the protagonist faces no obstacles that force a change in tactics or a re-evaluation of the goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion ("Fertilize the earth... and let peace grow") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently summarizing significance instead of showing it. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on generic fantasy diction ("ancient wisdom," "ethereal glow").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The prose is marred by the mechanical, repeated insertion of prompt phrases ("narrow vastness," "submerged concord," "after the reef dies") which disrupts the rhythm. The text relies on "telling" summaries and adjective-heavy descriptions ("tiny promise," "brittle and brown") rather than concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the prompt elements in the most obvious, literal way possible. There is no risk-taking or fresh twist on the concept of a gardener in a post-apocalyptic setting; it reads like a standard "healing the land" trope without specific, lived-in detail.</comment>
