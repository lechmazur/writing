<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The character is presented through summary and stated motivation rather than dramatized interiority or choice. There is no on-page struggle, contradictory impulse, or high-stakes decision-making under pressure, leaving the protagonist as a passive vehicle for the synopsis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The narrative is a synopsis spanning years and multiple locations, violating the short story scope of a continuous scene or tight shard sequence. Causality is reported via exposition ("He traveled," "He pieced together") rather than enacted through immediate scene-level interactions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setting details, while descriptively competent, are static and fail to constrain action or generate pressure. The shrine and port towns serve as visual backdrops for a summary rather than inhabited environments that shape the character's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Conflict is entirely summarized, with no immediate resistance or trade-offs experienced by the character on the page. The resolution is declared ("exposure brought her solace") without the cost being felt, rendering the emotional stakes abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The theme is explicitly stated in moralizing lectures ("This selfless act was the pure thing...") rather than emerging from subtext. The heavy-handed "telling" prevents any organic resonance or ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is flattened by the mechanical, verbatim repetition of constraint phrases like "weaves truth carefully." This robotic insertion disrupts the POV and creates a checklist-like tone rather than a distinct character voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Severe text loops degrade the prose; "borrowed starlight" appears five times and "weaves truth carefully" three times in a short text. This excessive, verbatim repetition acts as a scaffold that obstructs narrative flow and indicates a lack of line-level control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>While the concept of analyzing dream cameos is inventive, the execution as a synopsis stifles its potential. The reliance on repetitive phrasing and summary prevents the synthesis of elements into a unique or compelling artistic vision.</comment>
