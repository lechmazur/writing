<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character states are frequently labeled with abstract phrases ("protected vulnerability," "fragile courage") rather than embodied in action. The interaction with Leo lacks friction or distinct personality, reducing him to a mirror for the protagonist's internal resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is legible and orientation is immediate, with a clear closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the progression is linear and low-stakes, as the "viral" pressure is resolved through a symbolic gesture that meets no on-page resistance or complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "skeletal remains" of servers becoming a "cathedral of green" creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. Sensory details like the icicle tracery effectively ground the abstract themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the setting or the secondary character. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a tightening of choices or paid cost within the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Thematic coherence is present, but the narrative over-explains the symbols to the reader ("This was the grafting," "The pattern... was their blueprint"). Subtext is replaced by explicit thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and polished but overly interpretive, filtering events through therapeutic summaries. The tone remains static, lacking modulation between the "storm" of the past and the "hush" of the present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose has a smooth rhythm but relies on abstract noun phrases and repeated prompt labels ("honeyed hush," "quietly proactive") that tell rather than show. The density of figurative language occasionally blurs the immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A competent but formulaic "healing in nature" vignette. While the data center setting offers a fresh visual wrapper, the emotional trajectory and the "mosaic from broken pieces" metaphor are familiar territory.</comment>
