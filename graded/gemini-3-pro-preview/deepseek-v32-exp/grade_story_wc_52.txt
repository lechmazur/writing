<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined by explicit labels ("hauntingly practical," "no dreamer") rather than behavior under pressure. Emotional states are summarized via abstractions ("tremor in her soul," "heart a little lighter") instead of being embodied in the physical action of carving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks without causal friction; the wood yields immediately to the knife, removing narrative drive. Closure is achieved through a summary of internal resolution ("reconciled") rather than a decisive change in the character's situation or stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The loft and kettle anchor the scene functionally, but the sensory details remain generic ("soft, diffuse glow," "rain tapping"). The physical reality of the ash wood is glossed over with abstract adjectives ("smooth," "straight") rather than concrete textural resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually absent; the wood "responded to her touch" without resistance, and the kettle's constraint is dismissed when she "did not rush." There is no escalation of stakes, only a stated transition from grief to acceptance without visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Subtext is suffocated by explicit explanations of every symbol and theme ("symbol of his spirit," "love does not end with death"). The relentless repetition of thematic phrases ("here and gone," "crystallized time") flattens the emotional resonance into a lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is mechanical, heavily relying on the insertion of prompt keywords ("hauntingly practical," "crystallized time") to carry weight. This reliance creates a repetitive, artificial cadence that distances the reader from the character's lived experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Severe repetition artifacts degrade the prose; "crystallized time" appears five times and "hauntingly practical" three times in a short space, creating a distracting loop. The writing consistently "tells" meaning through abstract nouns rather than "showing" through image and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story executes the prompt as a checklist, resulting in a formulaic narrative lacking specific, idiosyncratic life. The central metaphor of carving is handled with standard tropes, offering no fresh angle on the process of grief.</comment>
