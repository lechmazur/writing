<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characters function as flat vehicles for prompt keywords rather than human beings. Emotional states are labeled ("solemn duty," "heart full") rather than embodied, and the protagonist lacks internal conflict or a distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes path where the goal ("flawless goodbye") is achieved without meaningful obstacles. The reconciliation with the daughter is unearned, resolving years of estrangement instantly without cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The setting creates a generic "white room" atmosphere ("above the clouds," "jasmine") but lacks functional specificity. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than constraining choices or influencing tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no resistance to her plan. The escalation is artificial, moving from diagnosis to a "flawless" resolution without a moment of doubt, trade-off, or failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("testament to how fragments can hold wholeness") rather than subtext. The narrative interprets itself for the reader, leaving no room for ambiguity or resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dialogue is unnatural and expository ("This will help us reunify you..."), acting as a container for required words. The narrative voice is overly sentimental and drifts into unearned omniscience regarding the characters' emotions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The prose is marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("hymning the mundane," "scent of hope," "pulsing stillness"). "Decisively kindness" appears as a grammatical error, and the reliance on clichés flattens the imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The story relies on the tired trope of a saintly hospice worker facilitating a perfect death and reconciliation. It lacks a fresh angle, specific detail, or psychological complexity to elevate the familiar premise.</comment>
