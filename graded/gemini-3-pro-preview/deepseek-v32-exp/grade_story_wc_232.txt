<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's "empirically intuitive" trait feels like a contradictory label used to justify the "whim" of following ants, weakening internal consistency. The final emotional shift is summarized in a realization rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure lands with a legible cost (Mara remains lost), but the plot relies on the coincidence of ants leading to the goal rather than causal agency. The "rising creek" adds effective pressure, but the bridge from shop to cavern lacks logical grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "blooming cavern" and "rising creek" provide concrete, atmospheric constraints that pressure the character's movement. Specific details like the "17th-century atlas" and the "matrix chip" ground the fantasy in the character's trade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rising water creates a tangible "live clock" that successfully forces a decision at the climax. The stakes are high and clear, and the final renunciation carries a felt cost, honoring the scope requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme is resolved through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("he understood that some promises are kept not by..."), which acts as a "thematic echo" and flattens the resonance of the action itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is generally consistent but leans on telling ("His motivation was singular") and clunky phrasing ("empirically intuitive"). The tone suits the fable-like quality but lacks distinct perceptual texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repetitive sensory tags ("glimmer," "shimmer") and the clumsy recurring phrase "empirically intuitive" clutter the prose. The writing is functional but lacks the fresh, specific density required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes the required elements competently, but the "portal to change the past" trope and the lesson of "acceptance" follow a standard, predictable trajectory without a fresh transformative angle.</comment>
