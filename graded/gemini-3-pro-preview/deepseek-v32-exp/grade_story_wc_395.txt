<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated ("driving need") rather than dramatized through struggle, and the protagonist's interiority relies on summary labels like "obsession" and "haunted." The "brightly attentive" attribute appears as a declared tag rather than a trait demonstrated through complex, high-pressure observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative structure reads as a synopsis or summary rather than a dramatized story, creating distance. While the causal chain is logical and the conceptual closure (finding the "silence") lands, the lack of scene-level immersion limits the impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The specific detail of the patch—frayed edges, bright repair thread—is excellent and effectively grounds the investigation. However, the broader setting relies on generic tropes ("vast, humming servers," "graveyard of moments") without unique sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, but the pivotal action—lying to the supervisor—lacks on-page pressure; the obstacle is introduced and resolved ("The lie worked") in a single breath without visible risk or tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("testament to the crew's desperation," "cost of memory") rather than subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance that fits the summary mode. However, the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("echo of forgotten songs," "sensed absence") feels mechanical and disrupts the narrative illusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant repetition of prompt strings ("sensed absence" x3, "echo of forgotten songs" x2) in a short space. The reliance on "telling" over "showing" reduces density and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist uncovering a conspiracy in deleted files is a familiar trope. While the "silence between the notes" ending is poetic, the execution follows a standard path without subverting genre expectations.</comment>
