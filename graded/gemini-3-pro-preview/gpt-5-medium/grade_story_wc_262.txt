<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal landscape is vividly rendered, particularly the visualization of feelings as spatial structures. The pivot from observer to participant is earned, though the emotional realization regarding "shyness" leans slightly into sentimental archetypes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc that tightens into a causal resolution when the protagonist recognizes her own name. The closure action—writing a counter-letter—is a decisive change that effectively reconfigures the story's initial state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The projection booth is an essential, active container that shapes the magic and the mood. Details like the "cooled drum" and "blue dental floss" provide excellent tactile grounding for the abstract concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes transition effectively from an abstract curiosity about "unused love" to a specific, personal confrontation. The cost—years lost to hesitation—is felt on the page, though the external pressure remains low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor of love as a warehouse is developed consistently and resolves with a resonant image of connection. The theme avoids simple moralizing by focusing on the lingering weight of "unperformed scenes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a consistent high-lyric mode. However, the rhythm is hampered by syntactic monotony, with too many sentences following an identical Subject-Verb structure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While the imagery is dense and imaginative, the prose suffers from a pervasive template cadence ("She [verb]... She [verb]") that flattens momentum. Additionally, some metaphors, like "doors ajar like vowels," strain for effect and reduce clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry with the specific setting of a vintage projection booth creates a fresh, memorable aesthetic. The blending of film terminology with emotional regret offers a unique lens on a familiar theme.</comment>
