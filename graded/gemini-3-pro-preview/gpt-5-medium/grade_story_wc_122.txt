<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s internal state is clearly drawn, and her connection to the physical sensation of sound is compellingly specific ("read his palms," "posture"). However, the inciting motivation ("feared numbness") is stated rather than dramatized through a specific failure or interaction, making the "cure" feel slightly smoother than the established stakes warrant. The emotional shift is earned through the ritual, though the initial deficit relies on exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative arc is a clean, coherent single scene that functions well under a lyric/accumulative lens. The "absurd surgery" of the drum and needle operates on a consistent magical-realist logic that the story teaches early. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's view of her art and future is effectively reprogrammed by the central ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern is a vividly realized setting that actively shapes the narrative possibilities; "basalt swallowed sound" and "mirrored hush" justify the acoustic magic. The sensory details are specific and support the themes of vibration and silence. The environment is not just a backdrop but a necessary container for the "filament of hush" to manifest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stakes are internal and clear, but the external pressure is low; Oko is a willing facilitator, and the "surgery" proceeds without snag or failure. The "cost" of the transformation is emotional vulnerability ("grief without speech"), which fits the lyric mode but lacks a sharp, foreclosing trade-off. The escalation relies on the intensity of the imagery rather than rising narrative friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "listening backward to move forward" is woven tightly into the mechanics of the plot and the central metaphor. The story resists a tidy moral, offering instead a resonant state of "balanced weight" and integrated grief. The motif of "hush" as a presence rather than an absence is handled with sophistication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent close-third distance that filters the world through Mara’s tactile perception. The transition from the physical description of the cavern to the surreal threading of the silence is managed with strong authority. The tone matches the magical realism of the premise perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmic, but suffers from a high density of similes ("like a lighthouse," "like frost," "like moons," "like fish," "like winter birds," etc.) which creates a scaffold of comparison that occasionally distances the reader from immediate experience. While the imagery is beautiful, the reliance on "like/as" constructions becomes a textural artifact. Line-level momentum is otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central conceit—a drum acting as a reverse phonograph to play back silence—is highly original and imaginative. The story transforms the trope of the "healer visiting a wise hermit" into something fresh through the specific acoustic and tactile focus. The synthesis of deafness, memory, and vibration feels unique and earned.</comment>
