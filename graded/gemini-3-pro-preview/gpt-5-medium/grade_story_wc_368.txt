<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict—between the dye master's urge to manipulate (using the wing) and the donor heart's urge to listen—is beautifully dramatized. The realization that magnetism is "posture" rather than greed provides a distinct, earned psychological shift that reconfigures their role from experimenter to guardian.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality is tightly wound; the experiment with the courier validates the method, while the escalation with the widow forces a crisis that demands the "indigo steam" counter-move. Closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, crystallizing the narrator's new stance as a "lighthouse" with the felt cost of eternal "waiting."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting acts as the primary mechanism of the plot; the tea house, the sun trails, and the morpho wing are not just backdrop but the tools of the conflict. The interaction between light, fabric, and narrative is established with high specificity, grounding the magical realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is clear: observation transitions to active manipulation, which creates a dangerous excess (stories burning like ash) that forces a tactical change. While the stakes are somewhat abstract/aesthetic, the danger to the widow provides enough immediate pressure to anchor the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of "iridescent caution"—looking sideways to see the truth—is perfectly integrated into both the physical action (tilting the wing) and the emotional resolution. The story avoids preachy morals, instead offering a complex view on the responsibility of witnessing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical and distinct, maintaining the "dye master" persona through textile metaphors (apron, fabric, indigo steam). The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering the magical events through a professional artisan's eye.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While the imagery is evocative, the prose relies heavily on a repetitive simile structure ("like a patient lung," "like a pebble," "like steam," "like ash," "like rain"). This template cadence creates a predictable rhythm that dulls the propulsion and feels like a stylistic crutch in an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dye craft, insect biology, and narrative theory creates a genuinely fresh magic system. The concept of manipulating stories by filtering light through a butterfly wing is imaginative and executed with rigorous logic.</comment>
