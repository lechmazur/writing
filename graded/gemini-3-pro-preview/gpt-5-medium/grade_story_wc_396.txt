<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist displays strong agency, proposing a concrete solution and paying a personal cost (staying to keep watch). However, a consistency slip undermines the character's definition: they are introduced as a summoned outsider ("they had summoned") but later refer to "our town," confusing the established distance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The structure is effective, moving from a magical diagnosis to a pragmatic resolution. The closure is excellent—a Resonant Reconfiguration where a practical plan replaces blame. The vintage store sequence feels slightly rushed as a summary beat, but it serves the causal chain well.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "shifting ice floes" and "lantern pears" providing necessary atmospheric pressure. The environment actively constrains the conflict (the need for safe paths) and shapes the final resolution (beacons and tide-based shifts).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes are clear and the escalation from "rasping throats" to a tense silence is well-managed. The cost is tangible: the protagonist commits to a season of labor. The conflict resolves through a shift in perspective grounded in action, not just words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of "empathy onto action" lands, but the delivery is heavy-handed. Dialogue and narration often slip into sermonizing ("guilt would be compost, not a flag"), which flattens the subtext. The final line feels more like an essay thesis than an earned narrative resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, though the "our town" slip disrupts the POV's established distance. The register is elevated throughout, which suits the mythic tone but occasionally makes distinct characters (Matilde, Harun) sound too similar to the narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from a high density of similes ("like tired wolves," "like trapped birds," "like a quiet choir," "like ropes," "like a page turning"). This repetition creates a formulaic rhythm that drags on the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-fantasy elements (seers, crystal shards) with a grounded, labor-based resolution is fresh and compelling. The setting—an orchard on a lighthouse above ice—is highly original and memorable.</comment>
