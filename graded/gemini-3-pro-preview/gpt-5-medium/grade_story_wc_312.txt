<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Efan is a consistent, archetypal protagonist who fits the fable-like tone, but he lacks deep internal friction or contradictory impulses on the page. His "earnest naivety" is stated more than dramatized through difficult trade-offs; he performs the ritual without genuine doubt or personal cost, functioning primarily as a vessel for the magic system.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where observation leads to ritual and result, with a legible "Conceptual Repricing" closure (accepting the echo rather than the original). While the causal mechanics of the magic are soft (chanting names fixes the cosmos), the internal logic is consistent, and the ending lands with a distinct resonant shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is integral to the plot; the viaduct, the salt scar, and the specific behavior of water droplets act as the mechanics of the resolution. Sensory details are vivid ("breathing through damp cloth," "gentle as flint dust") and actively constrain the protagonist's method, elevating the environment beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stakes (starvation, cosmic imbalance) are high but atmospheric, lacking immediate, sharp opposition in the scene. The "clumsy rhythm" of the approaching day provides a mild ticking clock, but the protagonist faces little resistance; the resolution comes from competence and patience rather than a hard-won struggle against an active antagonist or agonizing choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of accepting imperfection ("a healed knuckle," "an echo, not the original") is woven beautifully through the imagery and action. The story avoids preachy moralizing, instead letting the "modest" return of the fish serve as a resonant answer to the premise of "plausible impossibility."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, suiting the fabulist genre perfectly. The narrator maintains a steady distance that matches Efan's "lukewarm" nature, though at times the poetic register borders on precious ("back sang with salt").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, with strong rhythmic control and fresh imagery ("nodded like a pew creaking"). Line-level craft is high, with no visible scaffolding or artifacts, though a few metaphors ("compassionate arithmetic") lean slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical rhythm, tides, and a broken bell to fix a cracked constellation is imaginative and feels distinct. The "lukewarm mage" is a fresh take on the wizard archetype, valuing steady patience over power.</comment>
