<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ivo is a competent archetype (the wise workman) who executes a task flawlessly, but he lacks interior contour, doubt, or contradictory impulses. The narrative functions as "competence porn," offering satisfaction but missing the embodied cost or difficult choice required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clear and the closure is distinct (Resonant Reconfiguration via the courier's rescue), but the path is resistance-free. The inciting problem creates a linear track to success without setbacks or causal complications that force the protagonist to adapt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is excellent, functioning as both atmosphere and a tool that constrains and enables the protagonist's method. The description of the "steel canyons" and "corrugated walls" vividly grounds the "whisper" mechanic in physical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes are established early but lack pressure; Ivo dominates the scene with superior skill, never facing a moment of genuine risk or trade-off. The resolution is achieved without a "felt cost" or a tightening of options, capping the score under the 6.0 threshold for conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of subtle craft versus brute force is coherent and integrated into the action. However, the resonance is somewhat flattened by the didactic ending, where the moral is explicitly stated ("steel carries murmurs... if you listen") rather than left to linger in the image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like tone that suits the magical realism of the premise. The perspective stays firmly with Ivo, filtering the world through his specific, tactile understanding of the port.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and dense, but the reliance on similes is excessive ("like a saber," "like a scar," "like a cat," "like a nod," "like a full cup"), creating a repetitive texture. The mechanics are otherwise clean, with strong rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of a sound-based labyrinth runner in a container port is imaginative and fresh. The execution follows a standard fable template, but the specific combination of the geomagnetic storm and the "whisper" mechanic elevates the ingenuity.</comment>
