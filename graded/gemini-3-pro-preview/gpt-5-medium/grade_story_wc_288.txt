<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's non-human identity (tusks, herd memory) is masterfully integrated, grounding the surreal setting in physical weight and instinct. The choice to sing the "herd song" serves as a distinct, character-specific resolution to the crisis. The explicit declaration of motivation ("My motivation is...") is the only slight lapse in an otherwise shown, not told, internal arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the storm is quieted not by force but by a specific act of memory and vocalization. The causal chain—sundial diagnoses the knot, atlas provides coordinates, song restores balance—is distinct and satisfying under the Situational lens. The final image of the "word for shelter" cements the change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is intrinsic to the plot; the "vapor tides" and "stone circle" physics drive the conflict and resolution mechanics. The "avian stacks" and "drowned astronomy table" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that pressures the protagonist's movements. Every environmental detail feels load-bearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—the library's stability and the preservation of the voices—and escalate tangibly as the circle's hum turns to a "cough." The resolution requires an active, costly trade-off (invoking the painful herd memory to steady the present). The pressure is coherent and the release is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The transition from "isolation" to "shelter" is handled with nuanced thematic weight, avoiding simple binary resolutions. The concept of the library as a space of "listening" rather than just storage resonates powerfully in the final image. The ending recontextualizes independence as "a door held kindly," achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, meditative, and rhythmic, fitting the ancient/librarian persona well. However, the sentence "My motivation is to translate isolation into independence" reads as an expository scaffold rather than organic interiority, momentarily breaking the immersive spell of the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative ("hours that move like shorebirds," "floorboards remember my weight"). The imagery is consistent and drives the surreal logic. The "atomically reflective" descriptor creates a slight register clash with the mythic tone, and the motivation sentence mentioned in Q6 is a minor drag on flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a mammoth-librarian tending a floating tidal library via a stone circle is highly imaginative and specifically realized. The synthesis of elements feels fresh, avoiding standard ghost-story tropes in favor of a unique "fossil voice" mechanic.</comment>
