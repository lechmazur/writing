<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct ("softly persistent," "ledger of names") and the internal motivation to decode the gesture is compelling. However, the pivotal insight arrives via a "borrowed memory" that rises "unasked," which renders the protagonist passive at the climax of the investigation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (sweeping the dock, sending the signal) is resonant. The causal chain weakens when the solution relies on a supernatural memory download rather than active deduction, acting as a convenient bridge between the clue and the meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is active and tactile; the "notch rubbed bright" and the specific lighting of the "opal dock" constrain the protagonist's actions and serve as the physical key to the puzzle. The environment is not just a backdrop but an essential participant in the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stakes are intimate and felt, centered on the burden of witnessing a final wish. While the external conflict is low-key, the internal pressure to "decode" the silence is maintained, though the resolution comes a bit too easily through the memory vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "witnessed isolation" and the weight of memory is woven beautifully into the action, particularly in the final image of sweeping the dock. The concept of the "gap" unifies the method, the physical setting, and the thematic silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose establishes a confident, lyrical voice ("colors hushed themselves to gray vows") that fits the eccentric persona perfectly. The rhythm is controlled, and the transition from observation to memory feels stylistically consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high density and strong imagery ("lungs ruined by brine"). The phrase "opal dock" is used as a refrain; while effective as a frame, its third repetition feels slightly static in a short piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the "borrowed memory" concept with a lighthouse investigation is fresh and specific. The use of the physical notch as a communication device grounds the more ethereal elements effectively.</comment>
