<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is immediate and sharply defined, driving every beat from the opening sentence. The internal conflict—hunger for answers versus the "ghost of unasked questions"—is dramatized effectively in the final choice to wake the stone self. The "softly commanding" trait is well-integrated, showing rather than just telling her capacity for rule.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative arc is clean and linear, utilizing a causal loop that feels mythic yet logical. Closure is decisive: the Queen's choice to wake the stone self enacts a Resonant Reconfiguration of her identity with a clearly articulated cost ("who you will not be able to forgive"). The ending image of the pool—"calm as an eye"—lands the resolution perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and thematic ("crown cooling on a dish of salt," "flask the color of nicked bone"). The environment is not merely a backdrop but an antagonist and a catalyst; the bleeding starlight and the stone self are essential constraints that charge the final image, meeting the high-band standard for setting utility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (sovereign's unmaking) and escalate through the climb and the wanderer's warnings. The tension holds, though the cost of the final choice, while stated ("choose who rules"), remains slightly cerebral rather than viscerally demonstrated in the moment. However, the pressure on the protagonist is consistent and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of integration—embracing the "moth" and the "flame"—is woven organically into the action and dialogue. The story avoids simple moralizing, offering instead a complex view of power and memory. The recurring motifs (bleeding, braiding, knots) resonate effectively at the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, maintaining a high-fantasy, lyrical register that suits the fable-like content without slipping. The perspective is tightly controlled, filtering the world through the Queen's specific burden and hunger. The dialogue is stylized but purposeful, serving the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the prose is polished and rhythmic, the density of similes ("like wounds," "like an egg," "like a spilled bracelet," "like lost sparks," "like a low drum," "like a wound," "like an eyelid") borders on overwriting. This frequent figurative scaffolding distracts from the narrative momentum in places, despite the high quality of individual images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar fairytale tropes into a distinct and atmospheric narrative. The specific imagery (the salt, the stone self, the bleeding starlight) elevates the premise beyond a standard quest. It feels fresh and complete within its scope.</comment>
