<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("questions rot if kept") drives a pivotal micro-choice to ignore the warning tag, escalating the risk naturally. The internal conflict between safety and the need for answers is dramatized through action, culminating in a closure choice that accepts "measurement" over mercy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causality is tightly wound; the discovery of the tag and ledger logically propels the protagonist toward the climax. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the frame from a quest for mercy to a submission to measurement, satisfying the 9+ requirement for cost and recontextualization on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just backdrop but constraint; the physical nature of the shell (cracks, ridges) dictates the path and pacing. The "intervals" of the watchers serve as a tangible navigational puzzle, integrating environment intimately with the plot's progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from the abstract risk of the "sunwashed dread" to the concrete warning of the mother's fate. The "deepening" occurs when the protagonist realizes the watchers are indifferent measures rather than benevolent gods, forcing a higher-stakes decision to proceed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of knowledge requiring sacrifice is woven through the imagery of "questions rotting" and the mother's disappearance. The ending avoids a moralizing summary, instead offering a resonant image of the protagonist stepping into the "corridor of glare" that answers the central thematic question with action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistent, blending the technical lexicon of a cartographer with mythic resonance. The sensory filter ("sound like sand poured over bone") creates a unique perceptual signature that holds steady even under the pressure of the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is evocative and rhythmically strong, but the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("sunflowers," "light through deep water," "pressure that bruises" in quick succession) slightly blunts the immediacy of the climax. The craft is otherwise impeccable with zero scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the "city on a turtle" is a recognizable trope, the story transforms it through the specific lens of shell-cartography and the unique communication mechanic of the reed whistle. The synthesis of sound, measurement, and indifference creates a fresh, specific narrative identity.</comment>
