<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The protagonist is characterized immediately by a diagnostic label ("creeping normality noticer") rather than action, which creates an abstract distance. While the internal voice is consistent, the interaction with the woman lacks friction or distinct interpersonal texture; they align instantly in shared mourning without navigating a complex emotional hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative structure works well for this quiet, ritualistic piece, and the closure (planting seeds, committing to return) provides a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. The arrival of the woman feels somewhat convenient—a situational coincidence that eases the narrator's loneliness without requiring a causal effort—but fits the ghost-story mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is high, with details like "peeled lacquer," "thorn and nettle," and "bindweed" effectively grounding the secret tea house. The environment actively constrains the narrator's approach, requiring the "pruning knife" and patience, though the "palace" element feels slightly less tethered to the urban reality than the bakery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict is largely internal and abstract (memory vs. apathy), with the environment providing only mild resistance. While the ritual of cleaning and sharing bread creates a gentle deepening of the stake, the lack of an active antagonist or difficult choice keeps the pressure low; the "cost" is philosophical rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("I normalized the wound," "creeping normality is a better comedian") rather than allowing meaning to emerge subtextually. This tendency to explain the "sacred in the ordinary" diminishes the resonance of the actual images, treating the reader to a lecture alongside the tea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and meditative, fitting the atmosphere of urban exploration and memory. However, the register occasionally slips into clunky academic phrasing ("heuristically gentle") that clashes with the established "sap and steam" fable aesthetic, breaking the immersive spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense but suffers from "thesaurus-itis" and forced prompt insertion; the repeated phrase "heuristically gentle" is a jarring register error in a poetic text. Some metaphors lean toward purple ("leaves open like fists relaxing," "contract written in patient sap"), obscuring clarity for the sake of ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of urban decay, guerrilla gardening, and a ghostly tea ceremony offers a fresh, melancholic atmosphere. While the "ghost of a vanished place" trope is familiar, the specific ritual of the bread and the seeds provides a distinct and memorable texture.</comment>
