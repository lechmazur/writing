<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s internal landscape is vivid, and her transition from burnout to guardianship is earned through the tactile action of the wick-making. The motivation is slightly abstract ("hands into moths"), but the emotional logic holds and the renunciation of her old tools for a new purpose carries weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative arc is solid, moving from arrival to a decisive, materialized act of closure. The logic of the tarot-thread wick operates effectively within the story's lyrical physics, and the ending feels structurally earned despite the dream-logic causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like the salt-bandaged box and sweating stones create a tangible, specific world. The atmosphere exerts genuine pressure on the character, making the lighthouse felt rather than just described.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stakes are clear, and the pressure of the storm escalates effectively to force the central choice. The resolution comes perhaps a bit too fluently once the match is struck, but the cost—sacrificing the cards to feed the light—is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme is resonant but heavily undercut by the ledger entry explicitly stating the thesis ("Only by untangling threads can the light know where to go"). This thematic echo, combined with the summarizing final note, reduces the subtext to text and feels didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and confident but occasionally draws attention to its own artistry. The lyrical consistency is maintained, though it sometimes distances the reader from the immediate action by filtering it through heavy interpretation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from simile saturation (gulls like commas, lens like a tongue, rust like a clock, foam like stone, cards like windows). This density of figurative language, while often beautiful, creates a "template cadence" artifact that obstructs narrative momentum in favor of ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of the tarot and lighthouse elements is fresh and handled with specific, non-generic imagery. The concept of "threading" the light is a memorable, original turn that elevates the prompt materials.</comment>
