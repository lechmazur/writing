<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific physical reaction to lies (wilting) provides a unique, embodied constraint that drives the central conflict. The shift from individual refusal to a collective strike demonstrates strong agency and character growth under pressure. The motivation—a hunger for lost conversations—coheres perfectly with the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tight, with a clear causal chain leading from the refusal to the discovery and the final strike. The "rattling plank" is a slightly convenient pivot, though the Postmaster's later appearance implies it was a test, mitigating the coincidence. The closure is decisive and reconfigures the city's social contract with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the biology of the leaves and the mechanics of the greenhouse city are not just backdrop but active constraints on the plot. The sensory details—dampness, spores, the taste of mildew—create a tangible, immersive atmosphere that heightens the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conflict escalates beautifully from a personal ethical stance to a city-wide labor strike, forcing a resolution. The stakes are clear and palpable: the trade-off between comfortable lies and necessary, if painful, truths. The protagonist's choice to withhold their craft exerts genuine pressure on the antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of candor is explored with nuance, avoiding preachy moralizing in favor of a complex resolution where truth is a form of mercy. The "Pluviary of Spoken Things" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the cost of honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting a "gilded-leaf calligrapher." The interiority is well-rendered, balancing the character's professional pride with their personal vulnerability. The tone remains controlled even during the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythm. However, some metaphors border on overwrought or slightly imprecise (e.g., "mice with mapmaker teeth," "tooth finding its jaw"), creating momentary friction in an otherwise polished text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a biopunk aesthetic (truth-sensitive leaves) with a post-apocalyptic mystery is fresh and inventive. The concept of an archive for spoken truths ("condensing like rain") is a striking, original image that elevates the story beyond standard genre tropes.</comment>
