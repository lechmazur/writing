<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The deckhand's internal desire for arrival drives the narrative effectively against the surreal backdrop. The final choice to embrace the "undertow" of the tide over a static paradise represents a clear, character-driven resolution with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is excellent; the protagonist utilizes established tools (broom, patterns) to effect a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ship's reality. The logic of the surreal world is taught efficiently, and the ending pays off the "vanishing" stakes with a tangible arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "spectral grotto" and its star patterns directly constrain the protagonist's tactical choices. The sensory details ("water lay still as varnish," "ceiling dripped letters") create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—the commuters' "practiced hope" versus the delay. The escalation through the radio's voice to the navigational challenge is steady. The cost is conceptual but felt: the rejection of a painless "river without tides" for one with reliable struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of accepting "permanent transience" and the necessity of "undertow" for meaningful promises is beautifully integrated. The ending resonates without explicitly stating a moral, relying on the image of the pier and the frost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and surreal tone that fits the subject matter perfectly. The control of psychic distance allows the surreal elements to feel grounded in the deckhand's lived experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is evocative but suffers from metaphor density; nearly every sentence in the opening beats carries a simile or figurative image, which occasionally slows momentum ("hum like a beehive," "crackled like frying rain"). The "frost in the shape of timetables" borders on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of the prompt elements. The concept of navigating a ferry by tracing wake patterns into spilled starlight dust is inventive and visually striking. The "ghosts and salaries" line is a fresh, specific detail.</comment>
