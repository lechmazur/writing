<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("sandpaper rough memories") is distinct and drives the narrative logic effectively. Interiority is rich and embodied ("mouth full of borrowed thunder"), though the Chef's competence dampens the sense of personal risk during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arc is cohesive, moving from the inciting delivery of the box to a resonant resolution (the meal). Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the trauma is integrated rather than solved, with the cost transferred to the Chef's sensory experience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional; the "tidal pool" analysis of the sand dunes creatively constrains the characters' path. The score is capped at 8.8 because Q2 did not reach the 9.0 threshold required to unlock the 9-band here, despite the setting's excellence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (emotional contagion), and the pressure escalates as they approach the pavilion. However, the Chef's magical expertise resolves the climax ("let me cook you") somewhat smoothly, reducing the felt desperation or possibility of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of processing trauma without erasure is interwoven beautifully with the cooking metaphor. The final image of the "subsumed" memory in the Keeper's body offers a non-literal, earned thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical, but the relentless use of simile creates a rhythmic monotony that distances the reader. This score is capped by the line-level artifact debt (see Q7) which affects the distinctness of the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high-density simile overload ("like ash," "like a question," "like brine," "like old rope," "like a child," "like dunes"), creating a template cadence artifact. This figurative muddle distracts from the immediate action, especially in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of culinary magic with a desert-ocean inversion (coral in dunes) is imaginative and fresh. The "tidal analysis" of sand adds a unique, specific layer to the memory-diving trope.</comment>
