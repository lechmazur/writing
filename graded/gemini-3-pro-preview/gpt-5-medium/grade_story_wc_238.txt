<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's specific role as a "gossip-column exorcist" is brilliantly integrated, converting a character flaw (scandal-mongering) into the climactic solution (blackmailing the foreman). Agency is high, and the internal pivot from seeking personal absolution to honoring the living is earned and distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality is tight and character-driven; the narrative makes a successful decisive leap from the ghost's cryptic drawing (the peach) to the protagonist's tangible action (the phone call). The closure lands with a clear "Decisive Change" that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to their own past and profession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmospheric detail is vivid and sensory ("peaches and iron filings," "dust sang"), effectively grounding the magical elements. Occasionally, the descriptions drift into abstraction ("glass clouded by decades of patient sighs") that blurs the physical reality of the setting slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal desire for apology to an urgent external crisis (the orchard's destruction). The climax involves a legible, high-stakes trade-off where the narrator burns professional capital ("the column I had never dared write") to achieve a moral victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" is woven effectively through the narrative and resolves without didacticism. The concept that a "rumor can jam a gear when it carries a fact" beautifully synthesizes the gossip and ghost themes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is highly distinctive and consistent, perfectly justifying its stylistic quirks through the character's established trait of advising through metaphors. The lyrical tone holds steady even during the shift to practical action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While polished, the prose suffers from a high density of similes and metaphors (e.g., "stopped like a throat in smoke," "letters like shy fish") that creates drag during high-pressure beats. The relentless figurative language occasionally obscures the scene's immediacy, triggering the overwriting deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central conceit is ingenious; the synthesis of gossip columnist tropes with spiritual exorcism creates a fresh, non-obvious narrative logic. The execution fulfills the promise of the prompt with a unique, specific emotional resolution.</comment>
