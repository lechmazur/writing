<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal landscape is meticulously rendered, physically grounding abstract grief in "dry estuary mud" and "skin" sensation. The motivation to navigate emotional depths is active, not passive, driving the dowsing; the realization that the map is "marrow" feels earned by the sensory labor on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the goal (finding the stillpoint) succeeds but recontextualizes the desire from erasing grief to finding an "axis" within it. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly, teaching the navigational pattern and paying it off with a coherent internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "ultrasonic forest" is an exceptional sensory environment that actively constrains the protagonist's perception and method (touch/ring-pitch). The details—ring cooling like braille, leaves speaking above hearing—are functional, not just decorative, shaping the dowsing mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent and escalates through sensory intensity and the "ache" of the ring, though the physical path offers little resistance (the fern helps, the notes line up). The stakes are high and the cost—accepting the "planet the size of an ache"—is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of mapping grief rather than erasing it is integrated beautifully into the central metaphor ("consent to pivot without erasing the radius"). The ending avoids a tidy moral, offering a complex, resonant answer to the protagonist's initial quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is singular and highly controlled, maintaining a synesthetic consistency ("tasting vowels," "bark syllables") that fits the blind mapmaker persona. The lyric register is sustained without breaking character or slipping into generic observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose density is very high but purposeful, with no template loops or scaffold artifacts. Metaphors are bold ("weaponed with silence") yet strictly governed by the established world logic; the rhythm supports the "musical trail" motif without becoming repetitive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A strikingly original synthesis of cartography, disability, and speculative acoustics. The transformation of a "compass" into a tool for emotional dowsing feels fresh and inevitable within the story's specific logic.</comment>
