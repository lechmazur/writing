<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict regarding the unopened tin and the "missing laugh" provides a strong emotional anchor to the fantastical task. The connection between his profession ("quartz-eye mender") and his personal failure ("bad with goodbyes") is thematically tight. The "mending" of the orchard effectively mirrors his internal state without over-explaining the parallel until the very end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clean, resonant arc where the physical ritual (pruning, ringing the bell) facilitates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's grief. The closure—leaving the tin unopened while shedding the vows—is a distinct, cost-laden choice that earns the stasis. The orientation is immediate and the "unspent intention" provides coherent causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional; the "deciduous vows" growing as fruit in a cathedral's rafters is a vivid, constraining environment that drives the plot. The physical details ("branches arched like ribs," "rainbows on the ceiling") are specific and integral to the story's logic, transforming a standard location into a unique narrative crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately through the "thickening" of the orchard's intent. While the conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal rather than antagonistic, the pressure of the "rotting vows" forces a necessary intervention. The cost is paid in the use of the daughter's ribbon—a relic sacrificed for the graft—which lands the emotional stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of shedding vows like leaves is profound and beautifully executed, integrating flawlessly with the plot. However, the final paragraph ("What mattered was to persist... Call it accidental wisdom") explicitly summarizes the theme, reducing the resonance of the otherwise powerful imagery. Without this sermonizing capstone, the score would be higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent ("sap slurred," "mispronounced leaf"). The persona of the weary, expert mender holds up well. At times, the dialogue leans slightly into aphorism ("wisdom is what you trip over"), which risks feeling a bit precious, but the overall control of tone is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("wisdom... pretend you meant to kick"). The imagery is consistent and supports the magical realism. There are no major artifacts, though the phrasing occasionally draws attention to its own cleverness rather than dissolving into the experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept—an orchard fed by "deciduous vows" in a cathedral—is highly original and imaginatively synthesized with the mender's trade. The specific mechanics of the world (shedding promises, quartz-eye refraction) feel fresh and offer a unique lens on the familiar themes of grief and estrangement.</comment>
