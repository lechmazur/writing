<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The protagonist's "shielded openness" and professional curiosity create a distinct, consistent voice that anchors the fable-like tone. Motivation is clear and drives the investigation, though the lack of significant internal conflict or difficult trade-offs limits the character depth. The verger serves as a functional foil, highlighting the protagonist's gentle persistence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the map's tear to the video investigation and the chapel's reopening. The closure—framing the map with the wound visible—offers a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the central mystery. The progression is smooth, perhaps too smooth, with few obstacles obstructing the path to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory specificity is exceptional; the "rain-scoured" texture and the "hushed threading" of the wind act as central constraints and keys to the mystery. The setting is not just a backdrop but the antagonist and the resolution combined. Details like "sheep threaded between the stones like needles" ground the atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story relies on curiosity rather than urgent pressure; the verger yields easily, and the door is merely "remembered as sealed" rather than locked. While the mystery deepens logically, the stakes remain abstract and aesthetic. The protagonist faces no significant risk or high-cost choice, limiting the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of interpreting silence as architecture rather than miracle is handled with nuance and grace. The ending resonates well, recontextualizing the "tear" as a necessary seam between known and unknown. The final note in the window borders on didactic but fits the story's earnest tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, maintaining a consistent distance that suits the "perceptive framer" persona. The transition from technical observation to communal revelation is handled smoothly. The voice successfully bridges the gap between manual labor and spiritual metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high-quality imagery ("stubborn as a knuckle," "purl through the gaps") that reinforces the themes of age and texture. The rhythm supports the pacing well, slowing down appropriately during the descent into the vault. No significant artifacts or loops; the craft is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a map framer acting as a historical detective is fresh and engaging. Solving a "ghost" story through acoustics and architecture rather than supernatural elements offers a satisfying, grounded ingenuity. The execution is safe but elegant.</comment>
