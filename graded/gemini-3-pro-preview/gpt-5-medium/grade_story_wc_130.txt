<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("ambiguous loss," "clean grief") and intellectualized metaphors rather than embodied emotion. While the backstory of the sister provides a grounding moment, the character feels more like a vessel for the story's "mathematical" conceit than a living presence making difficult choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the ritual leaving of the eyes, but the mechanics of the "rope of light" create confusion. It is unclear whether the rope is a literal tether (connecting his pocket to the stalactite, physically restraining him?) or a purely metaphorical image; this ambiguity blurs the physical reality of the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "cavern orchard" is atmospheric and vivid, providing a strong surreal backdrop for the ritual. However, the description occasionally veers into the ornamental ("mineral blossoms," "fruit glistening like cooled tears") rather than strictly constraining the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stakes remain largely philosophical ("coherence" vs. "ambiguous loss") with low immediate pressure. The central conflict is resolved through an internal epiphany rather than a forced trade-off or external consequence, making the narrative feel more like a meditation than a story with urgent drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story explicitly articulates its thesis in a "theorem" paragraph ("love equals attention multiplied by time..."), which violates the "show, don't tell" rule and reduces subtext to a sermon. This heavy-handed thematic summary flattens the resonance of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but suffocated by a relentless density of metaphor ("scarves of misdirection," "equations wearing festival clothes"). The elevated register feels performative, distancing the reader from the raw emotion of the grief ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from significant overwriting and mixed metaphors ("skins catching the moonlight like equations wearing festival clothes"). The high density of similes in nearly every sentence creates a "purple" texture that obscures the narrative momentum and physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the premise of a conjurer performing a private grief ritual is compelling, the "geometry/mathematics of loss" conceit is a familiar literary trope. The execution relies on standard lyrical abstractions rather than a fresh, specific synthesis of the elements.</comment>
