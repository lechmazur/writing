<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is sharply defined not just by the label "grim optimist," but by the specific, embodied choice to reject the rupture to preserve the "texture" of memory. The internal conflict between the desire for the past and the commitment to the "proof" is dramatized with rigorous consistency. The final stance—continuing the climb to honor the form—is a profound moment of Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The narrative arc is tightly controlled under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the climb's repetition builds pressure that releases precisely at the rupture. The causal logic of the surreal world holds firm; the "lemmas" affecting the "gear" of the stair feels earned. Closure is exemplary: the sealing of the crack and the resumption of the climb creates a resonant, lasting afterimage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The staircase is an active, breathing antagonist rather than a static backdrop; details like the "black slots that sip my warmth" and the chalk that "refuses to wear down" create a vivid, claustrophobic reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist, forcing the specific tactical adaptations (eating dice numbers, writing proofs) that drive the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and remain high: the struggle against "smooth forgetting" gives emotional weight to the surreal climb. The conflict escalates naturally from physical exhaustion to the metaphysical crisis at the rupture, where the cost of the protagonist's rigor is fully paid in the refusal to step through.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story brilliantly synthesizes the mathematical concept of "perpetual motion" with the emotional experience of grief and regret. The theme—that accuracy in memory is a form of mercy—is explored through concrete action rather than abstract moralizing. The ending offers a sophisticated, non-literal answer to the central problem of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, maintaining a difficult balance between mathematical detachment and poetic longing that perfectly suits the character. The elevated register ("sober enough to measure," "grammar of afterward") is consistent and authoritative, never slipping into generic narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense, imagistic, and propulsive ("grain sings like paper under charcoal"). The required phrasing "balancedly daring" is inherently awkward and trips the rhythm slightly, but the author integrates it as smoothly as possible. The surreal logic is conveyed with high-definition clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece offers a highly original reworking of the infinite staircase trope, moving beyond simple horror into a complex allegory for memory. The specific mechanics—eating the dice rolls, the proofs as rungs—feel fresh and inventive, anchoring the abstract concept in tactile reality.</comment>
