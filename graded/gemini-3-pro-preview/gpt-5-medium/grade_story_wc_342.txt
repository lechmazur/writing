<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prosopagnosia is woven effectively into the artist’s perception ("shoulders confess more than eyes"), grounding their specific method. However, the internal arc of "learning limits" feels instructed by the letter rather than discovered through costly error or genuine struggle, making the character's growth feel slightly procedural.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The countdown creates effective structural pressure, and the closure (the mural surviving the fall) is resonant and earned. However, the puzzle resolution is too smooth; the coin fits the groove immediately, bypassing the potential for a "try-fail" cycle that would have heightened the narrative drive and causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The setting is tactile and specific, with the "tree trunk library" and "resined coin" acting as strong physical anchors that constrain the action. The atmospheric details of dust, light, and the "hollow" effectively ground the high-concept premise in a lived-in reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>External stakes are high (demolition), but the protagonist’s navigation of the "limits" challenge is executed as a checklist ("I test... I test...") rather than a desperate improvisation. The letter removes the ambiguity of the task, lowering the decision-making stakes during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and endurance is coherent, but the story relies on the Guild Master’s letter to explicitly articulate the thesis ("the tree endure if remembered"). This direct statement reduces the subtextual power of the final image, though the "sky inside walls" motif lands well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and lyrical, maintaining a consistent "artist's eye" perspective that justifies the sensory focus. The synesthetic blending of sound and sight ("read the coin's dimples as beats") fits the character's established perception without breaking the narrative distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imagery is evocative ("green by time," "cool rain on stone"), but the "breath" motif is repetitively overused ("held breath," "breath chooses," "room seems to breathe," "world holds its breath"). The line-level rhythm is otherwise strong, supporting the tension of the countdown.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination of the tree library and the face-blind artist creates a fresh, specific aesthetic that elevates the prompt elements. While the "secret book safe" is a familiar trope, the integration of the coin's "music" into the painting process offers a creative and specific twist.</comment>
