<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority relies heavily on diagnostic labels ("I am spiritually curious," "find strength in vulnerability") rather than demonstrated traits. While the voice is distinct, the self-awareness feels performed for the reader rather than embodied in the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds well, transitioning smoothly from maintenance to the mystical ending. Closure is achieved through the decisive action of opening the roof, though the station's anthropomorphism slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "fossil pollen" and "copper and old tea." The yellow lantern glass serves as an excellent constraining tool that charges the lighting and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>External pressure is mild; the power outage functions more as an atmospheric shift than a test of agency, resolved largely by waiting. The climax relies on an internal epiphany rather than a difficult trade-off or active struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The story explicitly states its moral ("the purpose of my small life was not to erase marks, but to polish them"), which deflates subtextual tension. This thematic echo in the climax substitutes explanation for resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, successfully evoking the "cosmic janitor" persona. At times it veers into being overwrought ("murmured to my bucket"), but the control of tone remains solid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose rhythm is strong and the imagery is dense ("warmed light into honey"). Some metaphors feel slightly strained or clichéd ("fear and wonder held hands"), but the line-level craft is generally polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While the "lonely space station caretaker" is a familiar trope, the concept of cleaning as a spiritual communion with "ghosts" is executed with freshness. The final image of meteors respecting a memory boundary is inventive.</comment>
