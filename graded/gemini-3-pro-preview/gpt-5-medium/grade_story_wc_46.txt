<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is rooted clearly in the backstory of fire, but the present action lacks a sharp, dramatized decision; the process feels habitual rather than a response to immediate pressure. The emotional arc is stable rather than dynamic, resulting in a portrait of stasis rather than a character under current stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works as a mood piece, moving smoothly from grotto to village with legible closure. However, the narrative drive is low-voltage, relying on routine enactment rather than a causal chain of events or obstacles to reach the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "sand-smooth slate" and "wet reflections" are vivid and specific, grounding the abstract theme. The setting actively provides the tools for the character's work, though the "milk into tea" simile in the final third feels generic compared to the earlier marine specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pressure is low; the central conflict (fire vs. safety) is historical rather than immediate, and the environment offers no active resistance. The story lacks a "tightening" moment where the protagonist faces a new obstacle or hard trade-off; the village simply waits and accepts the gift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of patience versus destructive speed is well-integrated and resonates in the final image of the "gentle compass." The ending offers a genuine resonant reconfiguration of the concept of light, successfully landing the "light without fire" premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a meditative rhythm that suits the content. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism ("zephyr bloom," "petal-cool softness") that feels ornamental rather than organically arising from the character's gritty work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphor coherence fails in the opening ("breathe its petal-cool softness like a compass" is logically opaque; compasses do not breathe or possess softness). Additionally, clichés like "milk into tea" dilute the otherwise specific imagery, triggering coherence and artifact deductions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core concept of "sea glass lanterns" as a trauma response to fire is fresh and evocative, creating a unique atmosphere. The execution is solid, though it leans on safe, lyrical description rather than narrative risk or unexpected structural turns.</comment>
