<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The protagonist is highly competent and wise but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; the trait "functionally creative" feels like a label rather than a source of difficult choices. The arc is smooth and inevitable, lacking a moment where the character's flaws or doubts create resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well, moving from diagnosis to repair to social application with clear logic. The closure is resonant, anchoring the abstract "resurrection" in the concrete arrival of the "Arrivals" roster and the mother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; vivid, specific details like "confetti in the vents" and "sinks coughing" ground the surreal premise. The physical space feels lived-in and inextricably linked to the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conflict is largely atmospheric; the building and the janitor yield to the protagonist's interventions without significant friction or cost. The "headaches of functioning mercy" are stated as a future cost rather than dramatized in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme is profound but undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("I understood that hope is engineered"). This tells rather than shows the resonance, flattening the ambiguity of the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyrical, reflective voice is consistent and captures the requested "stoic wonder" tone effectively. It maintains a distinct texture, though the high register occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose suffers from high metaphor density; nearly every sentence employs personification or simile ("silence took inventory," "sinks coughed"), creating a breathless, overwrought texture. A scaffolded list pattern ("I rerouted...", "I flipped...", "I reversed...") dulls the momentum in the middle section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of using navigational tools to "engineer hope" in a sci-fi ruin is imaginative and fresh. The synthesis of spaceport decay with social shelter mechanics offers a unique angle on the "abandoned place" trope.</comment>
