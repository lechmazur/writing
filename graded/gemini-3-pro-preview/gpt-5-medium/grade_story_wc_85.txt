<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal landscape of guilt and forgery is compelling, creating a strong lens for the narrative. The reveal that he was the boy who saved her father adds a melodramatic coincidence that slightly undercuts the autonomy of the present-moment dynamic, but his choice to confess restores agency. The shift from deceiver to collaborator is earned through the shared activity of the archive search.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Structure is solid, moving efficiently from the terrace to the archive and resolution. The "Parliament of Wood" provides a tangible mechanism for the climax, grounding the emotional realization in physical action. Closure is distinct and decisive (burning the lies), though the backstory link relies on a fortuitous past connection rather than purely causal pressure generated in the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "Parliament of Wood"—a driftwood archive of births and deaths—is a brilliant, specific invention that elevates the story. This setting actively constrains the characters’ search and charges the final realization, transforming a standard dialogue scene into a physical excavation of truth. The atmospheric details of salt and sea effectively permeate the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stakes of truth versus manufactured safety are clear and present throughout. The tension escalates well during the search, though Mara’s reaction—"tempered regret" rather than fury—resolves the conflict somewhat too smoothly, reducing the potential emotional cost of the protagonist’s years of deception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a construct versus truth as a physical remnant is well-developed. However, the ending leans into explicit moralizing with the final line ("Belief, like time..."), which summarizes the thesis rather than letting the resonant image of the burning planks speak for itself.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, fitting the archivist persona. At times, the metaphoric density borders on overwrought (e.g., "eyes the color of the tide after it thinks of retreat"), which distances the reader slightly from the raw emotion of the encounter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and rhythmic, but the integration of the required phrase "sieved hush" results in a clunky, repetitive sentence ("sieved hush sifted... like wind searching a sieve"). Some metaphors feel strained ("tide published ledger praying"), drawing attention to the writing rather than the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central conceit of a black market genealogist forging lineages combined with a municipal archive carved into driftwood is highly original and imaginatively executed. This freshness lifts the story above the standard "confession of a lie" template.</comment>
